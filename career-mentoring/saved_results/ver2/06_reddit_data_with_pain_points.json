        "content": "Hello, \nI've been seeing alot of youtube videos of layoffs in the tech field, and how hard it is for these people with years of experience to find a job. I'm worried that I made the wrong choice. I've been working in the kitchen for 10+ years, and during the pandemic I realized that I needed to find a more stable career. I've been in school as a computer information systems major/ minor statistics  because I initially wanted to pursue a field related to data. I've never even heard of data science befofe 2020 lol. But I found about cybersecurity, and from all the youtubers/dept of labor statistics, it seemed like this is a field that will grow tremendously and would be a stable career choice.It also seemed more accessible to older 2nd career adults. I took some elective classes for cybersecurity(networking/ aws) and I've been studying to get certifications. But now Im just seeing way too many people getting laid off and unable to get back in. I just don't want to waste my time.. im about to hit my mid 30s and I don't want to invest all this time and money to later be unemployed and still in the kitchen. So, for those working in the field, do you think this field will continue to stay like this...will it get worse or better?Also, Im kind of tired of hearing people say do it if it's your passion..don't do it for the money. I was watching an interview with one of the popular cybersec youtuber and even he was talking about how he personally know talented people who have been laid off and unemployed for months! \nHe said something along the lines of how they're able stay positive because it's their passion or whatever. But I've realized after trying to pursue my passion in pastry, in the end I chose stability over passion. And yes, I know I won't be making bank in this field, but having been paid shit money for the past 10 years and seeing the financial limits in the culinary field, simple livable income and room for growth is enough for me. Any input is appreciated and thank you for reading if you read all of this!",

        "content": "Alright. \nThis is gonna be a long one so buckle up.\n\nI have seen countless post from people that fall into the following categories:\n\n1. I wanna get into IT but I have seen too many gloom and doom posts here and I am scared now.\n\n2. I want to get into IT but I wanna work remote, make over 100K, and be in cybersecurity.\n\n3. How do I get into IT? What do I need to do?\n\n4. Which degree should I get? Which certificate should I get?\n\nLet me start by saying I am not making fun of anyone or judging anyone. I am just hoping to help clear up some questions for people. \n\nIt has been said many times before but the wiki is the best place to go for all of your questions. You can find it here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/s/y0A6PVaYG8\n\nBesides that, here is all you really need to know about the above questions:\n\n1. Yes, the IT market is very saturated right now and very competitive. This does not mean that you are screwed if you are trying to get into IT. There are some places that are better for IT jobs than others and location plays a big part in it. \n\nThe market is also cyclical and it is unlikely that it will stay this way forever, but even if it does, if you work hard and push yourself you can make it happen.\n\nYou also need to take into account that lots of industries are suffering like this right now, not just IT, so making your decision solely based in that will not work out well.\n\n2. Roles this great do obviously exist, but they are NOT entry level roles. They are going to be senior level roles where the people filling them have 7-10+ years of IT experience already. \n\nDoes this mean you should give up? No. It just means you need to tailor your expectations. Get whatever entry level job you can get first (help desk, support tech) and work your way up and gain experience so you can make it to that dream job one day.\n\n3. The best advice I can give you for getting into IT is this:\n\nExperience > Certificates or Degree\n\nExperience is king and is what everyone is asking for. This is way just getting your foot in the door and getting a job is the most important. So you can start building experience. \n\nIf you cannot get that job then start home labbing. Set up equipment and mess with configurations and learn that way. If you cannot afford a home lab then there are free resources out there that can help you learn. For specifically networking, you could download Cisco Packet Tracer and build networks on that for practice. It lets you practice routing configurations and network architecture and all that great stuff. This is just one example, but there are other free resources like this out there depending on what side of IT you are looking to get into.\n\n4. This depends on the situation. If you get a degree, your best bet is almost always going to be getting a generic IT or CS degree. Speciality degrees (like cybersecurity) sound great but you want to focus on broad, foundational knowledge early in your career and then specialize later.\n\nSo if you want to get into cybersecurity you could get a general IT degree and then pursue cybersecurity certificates, for example.\n\nNow as far as certificates go, you almost always want to get your entry level certificates if you havent already gotten into IT. Think CompTIA A+, Network+, and Security+.\n\nIf you have a solid foundation already and want to start specializing, then there are other routes as well (like CCNA for Networking or Azure/AWS certificates for cloud or PenTest+ for security). There are many more options than what I am giving you here but you get the idea.\n\nIf you want to get into IT, then go for it. The only thing stopping you is you. Dont let the doom and gloom scare you.\n\nMisc. Things:\n\n1. AI will not replace you, AI will change the landscape of how IT works but we will still be here. Other jobs will be replaced sooner than IT will (think low skill, low mental capacity type jobs).\n\n2. Cybersecurity is very rarely an entry level role. More than likely, you will have to get a regular entry level IT job and study up, get certificates, and pivot into cybersecurity.\n\n3. I recommend looking at the material for Tech+ and ITF+ from CompTIA if you have zero IT experience. They are their most basic certificates for IT. If you struggle with that material, that is not a good sign (this doesnt mean you cant get into IT, it just means that it will be much harder for you and it will take you longer to grasp concepts and material as you learn).\n\n4. IT is an industry that requires consistent learning (some people get away without doing this, but if you want to remain competitive, then you will be constantly learning). This means studying for certificates, learning new systems, learning new concepts, and doing it in your own time sometimes.\n\nI say this to get across the fact that if you are not truly interested in IT, you will probably see this requirement as a burden and it will turn you off from a career in IT (do not let this one issue stop you, just be aware of it).\n\n\nAll of this is to say if you are truly wanting to get into IT then go for it and work hard for it. Start with general knowledge and do not worry about specializing until you actually start your IT career. You got this!\n\n\nEdit: we are going to agree on Experience > Degree or Certificate, rather than Experience > Certificate > Degree\n\n\nEdit: if you do not like talking to people or are not interested in customer service type roles, IT might not be a great choice. A lot of entry level roles (like help desk) and even senior roles (like sysadmin) require pretty significant interaction with users.\n\n\n\nTLDR;\nYou dont get one. Go read it.",

        "title": "IT career hard truths you don't see enough of...",
        "content": "* **IT isnt all that sexy of a career**.  A lot of non-techie people don't understand and/or care how IT works. Either their computer device works or it doesn't. Anything else feels like a science class. They don't care about the how, why, or what. So, it's not the best conversation starter. Youll also meet people who stigmatize IT professionals as the stereotypical computer geeks.\n* **On-call rotations are a fallacy.** For the most part, you are always on-call. Are you the most/only knowledgeable person on the subject? Call. Are you the only one available? Call. Are you the most dependable? Call. The person that is on-call is working on the issue but cant figure it out? Call.\n* **Sometimes you have to job hop for skills/experience.** You hear a lot about job hopping for more money but not much about hopping for more experience. Not every company is using all the cutting-edge tech and doing all the trendy IT tasks. You may find yourself at a company that youve outgrown from a skill/experience stand point because they aren't moving fast enough into the current tech trends. A lot of companies dont need or want to adopt. Maybe you want to work on large enterprise networks but your company only manages a small campus. Even if youre getting good money you'll have to decide if you should jump ship or stay stagnated skill-wise. To clarify, there really is no wrong decision in that situation.\n* **The path to maximizing salary and work-life balance are often different**. When I say work-life balance, I dont mean \"yay i work 40 hours a week and not 60\". I mean jobs where you maybe work a few hours a day, make a good wage, have good benefits, and have optimal time off/flexibility. Low stress jobs. Im not saying you cant have both but for the average person, those top tier salaries come at a price. Early on, most of us prioritize the money but when you get a satisfactory wage you start focusing on other benefits. There isnt any wrong path as long as you're comfortable with it. I'll be honest: This one is more subjective because there's so much to consider.\n* **\"Always learning\"gets old as you get older.** Youre always learning in IT for the length of your career. It's part of what makes it interesting, but it's draining consistently having to learn a new way to do what you've been doing for years just to stay relevant. So I can understand why some people eventually become reluctant to change.\n\nedit: \n\nHonorable mentions\n\n* Tbh, Your co workers do not want to train or mentor you.\n* Some systems are meant to be sub-optimal. \n* Burn out is common and inevitable without the right boundaries. \n* strong-soft /weak-tech skills > weak-soft/strong-tech skills\n\n\n\nWhat are you hard truths you dont think we see enough of?",
        "pain_points": "1. Foundational skills are crucial for IT careers, including troubleshooting, effective information searching, and communication.\n2. Not all IT professionals make a substantial income; many are in entry-level roles with low wages.\n3.

Cybersecurity is not an entry-level field, and breaking into security often requires in-depth knowledge and expertise.\n5. Networking and soft skills are more critical than technical knowledge, as being personable is vital in the field.\n6. Some IT systems are sub-optimal, and maintaining a balance between the two extremes is crucial.\n7. Burnout is common in IT due to understaffing and exhausting workloads.\n8. The perception of IT being a glamorous career is subjective, varying by individual and background.\n9.

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nTLDR: I enjoy coding; previous job moved away to everything except coding; quit my job; now I have no clue what to look for since I am really afraid of a boring job.\n\nI'm in my early 30s, based in Switzerland, and I have a Master's in CS. I've worked at a European company for 8-9 years (200 employees in CH), where I was the only in-house developer (but few other devs in eastern Europe). \n\nEarlier this year I had the gut feeling that I need to change something and step out of my comfort zone and thus quit my job.\n\nFor the company I developed a comprehensive software system (UI, Backend, DB, distributed web services) that has become essential for the company's operations and is now being rolled out for other countries as well since for CH it was a huge success.\n\n**Why I Left My Job:**\n\n1. **Overwhelming Responsibilities:** The software's growth meant I was handling analysis, integrations, 1st-3rd level support, rollout planning, devops, testing, and internal development planning almost entirely on my own (since 2 years I had another good developer from eastern Europe, but - altough test coverage was quite high - always had to check every single change since the complexity of the software was enormous and he was not that clear about out business logic).\n2. **Passion for Coding:** I love deep, complex development work and the hyper focus, but now that we went live with the software, in the last 2-3 years my role shifted towards management and support, which I didn't enjoy (in the past few months maybe 20% of my time was coding). In the first 5-6 years it was mostly coding since it was more like a proof of concept kind of thing with some quite challenging algorithms.\n3. **Additional Tasks:** Besides the main software, I developed and supported other smaller tools, acted as a product owner & tester for several other tools, and handled data extracts for f.e. AI projects. I also managed devops and DBA tasks for other tools.\n\n\n\nAfter resigning, my manager suggested I take on an analyst/PM role, leveraging my strength in understanding the business and thinking ahead.  However, I prefer coding and tackling complex development challenges.\n\n\n\nSo now that I am now traveling for 2-3 months already, I am starting to become ready for the next challenge, but I have trouble on finding out what it could be**.** What I'm looking for is:\n\n* I want to stay in IT and continue coding, focusing on complex and challenging projects (at first I considered to completely leave IT and start from scratch, but I know that would not end well)\n* I'm concerned that a typical coding job might be too routine and not challenging enough, so probably I should look for a smaller company and not for some bigger company (tbh to some extend I liked the chaos of my previous job)\n* Self-employment is an option, but it might involve handling support and devops independently (my old employer could provide projects).\n* Returning to my previous employer either as a developer (but I risk ending up in the same situation) or alternatively, I could focus on business analysis, but that wouldnt satisfy my passion for coding (and also really looking into a new challenge and leaving the comfort zone) - only reason that speaks for this is the comprehensive knowledge I have about everything in this company.\n* Im considering a shift to AI, though my experience is limited (altough my master thesis was related and I was the PO of some AI projects). Also ETH Zurich offers courses that could help me get started. I have a feeling that this could be interesting and challenging, but not sure if I see myself there.\n* Another option is pursuing a PhD, but I worry it might become monotonous to focus on a single topic for that long (but I think CH offers some quite nice positions).\n\nAny advice on potential career paths or opportunities that align with my interests and skills would be greatly appreciated! Recommendations for literature or podcasts are also welcome.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!  \n\n\nNB: formatted and summarized it a bit with ChatGPT",

        "content": "What should I do in a situation where, due to an unfortunate combination of events, I have no references but 10 years of work experience?\n\nIve only worked at two places. I worked at Job #1 from 2012 to 2018 where I progressed from desktop support to Jr Sysadmin, and was a sysadmin at Job #2 from 2018 to June of this year. I got along well with Frank, one of the higher ups at Job #1. When I applied for my most recent job (Job #2), I used Frank as a reference, and a couple of coworkers, since 3 references in total were required.\n\nAccording to my new supervisor at Job #2, Frank gave such a strong reference that he didnt even bother calling the others on my list.\n\nAt Job #2, things were fine for the first couple of years. But in 2021, I underwent a complicated series of medical procedures, and I needed to use all of my allotted FMLA and most of my PTO. On top of that, my mother was diagnosed with dementia, and I was working on my bachelors in business during evenings and weekends. I had a grant to attend college tuition-free, but I had to have continuous enrollment to qualify. I checked with administration to see if I could take medical leave, but they told me if I did I would have to start paying. \n\nThis led to me burning out and receiving a poor performance review and a demotion (with the same pay and title) due to decreased work ethic and lack of attendance. For context, from 2021 to 2022, I had 4 inpatient surgeries, 2 ER trips, and dozens of physical therapy appointments and post op appointments in a 12 month period.\n\nHowever, the supervisor for Job #2 initiated an offer to give me a good reference if I decided to move on to another employer due to the demotion. \n\nLast week, I was offered a new job contingent on a reference check. One of the references was required to be a supervisor from the past 5 years, meaning I was forced to use the Job #2 supervisor as a reference. I messaged my supervisor asking if he would give a reference, to which he said he would be happy to give a good reference, although HR would prefer I only confirm your title and the start date of your employment. \n\nI next tried to get in touch with Frank, the really good reference from Job #1, via phone and email to ask his permission to use him as a reference again. No response to either request. With Frank out of the picture, and also unable to establish contact with a couple of other potential references from Job #1, I was forced to use a coworker from Job #2. He also reassured me he would give a good reference.\n\nLast week, I found out the offer for the new job was rescinded since my references said that I had a poor work ethic and attendance record. As stated earlier, I had major medical problems in 2021-22, making it difficult for me to give my all at work while dealing with severe complications requiring emergency care, scheduling follow up surgeries, and all of the associated stress of being a medical patient with unresolved physical problems for an indefinite period of time. And both of these individuals told me they would give good references, with my supervisor initiating the offer to start with.\n\nAt this point I feel like I need to go into another career field entirely because I have no references who will speak positively about my work. And in 10 years of working, I have only had one poor performance review, the most recent one, due to me being out on medical leave.\n\nWhat do I do next?",

During this time i also was into web design, and i started freelancing on the side in my free time and making websites for friends, myself, and small businesses here and there (2021-2023). In December of 2023 i started an LLC for web design, and i had 2 overseas employees working for me on a contract basis, and i would serve as project manager. I expanded our services to include web hosting as well, and now we manage web hosting services for a handful of our clients.\n\nOk boom. In july of 2024, i saw a youtube video that was titled start your cybersecurity career in 7 days. While it did pique my initial interest snd curiosity, i was obviously skeptical because i had been hearing about how cybersecurity isnt entry level. That youtube video changed my life. After watchin that YouTube video, i go t the following certifications in a few days: qualys vulnerability management, detection, and response (VMDR), Qualys cybersecurity asset management (CSAM), and qualys vulnerability management scanning (VMS). From there i started getting into cybersecurity youtube, and started finding more free courses. I started the google cybersecurity professional certifcate program, and i loved it. It gave me hands on experience with linux, sql, and python, (3 things i had NEVER used or even seen before). I became obsessed. I started doing TONS of projects, labs, and activities that would help strengthen my skills and resume. Besides those 3 languages, the google course also gave me experience with tcpdump, wireshark, and google chronicle. While i was taking the google course i was also doing some free cybersecurity virtual experience programs on the forage. I completed the mastercard cybersecurity program, the datacom cybersecurity program, the PwC switzerland cybersecurity program, the commonwealth bank intro to cybersecurity program, and most recently the Telstra cybersecurity SOC program. From these i gained hands on skills in other things, like  splunk, cybersecurity engineering, SOC incident response, and more. While i was doing all of this, i was slowly creating and building up both my resume and portfolio, and adding cybersecurity recruiters on linkedin.\n\nAfter completing the google course (which took me exactly two months coincidentally; july 24- september 24th) i started applying to jobs. I was spamminggggg applications and sending messages to recruiters. I just started applying to jobs last friday (september 21st) and sent out probably 200 applications in total. Yesterday, i got my first invitation to an interview, and it was for a cybersecurity analyst position at a bank. I almost shed tears of happiness because of how happy i was that all of my hard work is paying off. Obviously i understand its only an interview, and i dont have the job yet, but still it was so rewarding to see that email, and feel as though my endless hard work for the past few months has been paying off. I am still going to apply for more jobs, and continue to further my education and skills.\n\nI am going to get my compTIA Security+ soon (now that i have the 30% discount voucher i received from the google cybersecurity course) and i also scheduled the free ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity exam for november 6th. I cant wait to keep adding onto my list of skills and certifications. Ive been obsessed with cybersecurity lately, and i hope to make this my new career. \n\nEdit: also, a few ppl have asked about my portfolio, so im going to link it here: [my cybersecurity journey](https://justingoncalves34.github.io/Cybersecurity_Journey/)\n\nEdit 2: didnt get the job ill keep studying though, completing courses, and adding projects and experience along my journey.

        "content": "Background: Ive been an IT engineer for 19 years, first as a network/system engineer, then transitioning to cybersecurity to the point where thats been my primary role the past 5-ish years. None of my jobs ever required a certification, so I had none, but decided to get my Security+ for the sake of job hunting.\n\nAfter going through some practice materials, I decided my study goal would be to just fill in the gaps on things Id need to memorize: acronym definitions, the difference between MOU/MOA/MSA, etc. Things that Ive never needed to know in the real world, and certainly wouldnt need memorized, but whatever.\n\nI skimmed 2 books, taking notes along the way on those things I didnt know off the top of my head. First was an ebook of the Mike Chapple/David Seidl Study Guide, provided by my jobs ebook library. It was pretty awful, focusing on a lot of stuff that wasnt in the exam, and being plain wrong about others. (e.g. It defined perfect forward secrecy as what Tor uses to forward packets. [This is not a joke](https://imgur.com/a/37Wj8zo).) Finding that it left a lot of gaps yet to fill, my 2nd book was the official CompTIA Sec+ study guide.\n\nAfter doing a bunch of practice questions, I was feeling more confident, and it seemed that the ones I had trouble with were mostly because they were just poorly written (with some even having typos), but surely the actual test itself wouldnt be that bad, right?\n\nIt was worse than I imagined. There were so many questions where I was just baffled about what they were talking about. And not in the way of I dont understand this definition or concept, but rather in the way that the scenarios were so vague that all I could do was pick either the answer I think they wanted, or the least-bad answer. (One question even had a typo!) A lot of the questions were of the variety: a thing happened, and youve discovered this evidence. what should you look at next?, and its so vague that depending on the real-world context, multiple of the answers could be reasonable. I purchased a package that came with a free retake, and as I was going through, I thought to myself, if I fail, I have no idea what to even focus on, because the things that are giving me trouble are just bad questions.\n\nAnyway, I had no idea that Id get my score then and there at the end, so I was pleasantly surprised to be presented with a passing score of 805. I kinda wish theyd let me review the things I got wrong, but Id probably have an aneurism over them.\n\nTLDR: Security+ is a terrible exam, and neither the study materials nor exam itself are a substitute for real world experience. Id never base hiring someone on whether they did or didnt have the certification.",

Thank you for any insight.\n\nI've been strongly considering joining the military to gain experience in the field and to get my foot in the door. That being said, I have a little background, I am 30, I have a business degree, and I've been working in management roles over the last several years. I and a few coworkers were recently laid off about a month ago due to budget cuts with the company and I have had 0 luck landing another role, either they ghost me, they never reach out after the interview, never reach out in general or nothing at all happens. This has been with I would say 100s of applications. I am looking for a change career wise. I always wanted to do something with IT but never did for some reason. So I am looking at it like this is my biggest chance, and it's now or never. Is the military a good idea for this?\n\nQuestions here.\n\nWhat branch would be the best for cyber? How long are cyber contracts? Are they all 6 years in every branch?\n\nWhat branch would offer the best QoL? \nThis would more than likely only be one enlistment, so it's not something lifelong, so I understand it's the military, and I'll be in a barracks, etc. \n\nWhat branches training would be the best for cyber?\n I've read different things based on the training provided, failure rate, what happens if you fail, etc. Any first-hand experience would be very welcome.\n\nWhat would transition best to civilian life?\n I've read some branches give you alot of certs, and some don't. I've read basically all give you a clearance which alone is valuable. \n\nWhat branch would also fit my age better?\nI've heard people say to commission, but I don't have a degree in computer science or STEM, so it's not possible. I also want experience, training, and learning the field. Also, I get it. It's the military. People younger than me, older than me, etc. Again, I'm not really bothered about it. They put in the time.\n\n-So last question is there any branch that does their job more over another?\nI've read various posts where people said they learned maybe a year of experience vs. their 6 year contract. Due to being pulled away from their job, etc. \n\nThat being said, I'm only interested in IT/cyber. So I believe AirForce would be out because the chances I've read of getting it are not likely. Since it's a 1-10 or 1-15 dream sheet shot. Army, I've read you can pick. Navy, I've even read you can pick, so that's another option too.",

(if I should take it down, just let me know)**\n\nSo, I was really hoping to get some advice here. I've been a developer for quite some time, and it has been something of a rollercoaster ride for me. There may be some underlying issues that I've been ignoring, but I was hoping that maybe you guys could help me identify those. My career thus far has been both good and bad, but even in school, it was the same.\n\nThe goal of this post isn't to bash my previous teams, but I truly wonder if anyone has had this much fluctuation in their career path as an engineer. Sometimes, I wonder if this is actually a common occurrence in software development careers, or if this is just a team/company issue. More so now than ever, I've considered switching careers, because it truly seems like it will be a constant.\n\nI've presented 5 distinct experiences so far just so you'd have context. \n\nI would really appreciate anyone's advice, feedback, or guidance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**College:**\n\nSo, in college, I was a Mathematics major. I grew up loving math, and I loved all that you could do with it. However, I learned very quickly that once we got to the proof-based courses (all the others were fine), it was as it I just couldn't think in the same language as my professors. I didn't do very well, but I managed to get by. I also picked up a minor in Computer Science, which was fun with the exception of the OS-level courses. I simply loved how creative I could be with it. So, I pursued a career in software engineering.\n\n**First Job:**\n\nMy first job as a software engineer was both good and bad. I got creative projects and I got to make changes that people around the world could see. I was 100% the \"UI-guy\" at this point, because our previous UI specialist had left the company. I had a role, and it was great. I could be creative at work, and help millions of people. Eventually, we had a re-org, and this put me on a new team, where UI work was not at all something they cared about. More often than not, I found myself in situations where I was asked \"why don't you know this?\" or \"why do you keep looking up how to do things instead of memorizing them?\" This was usually in reference to OS-based things. I tried my best to be useful in every other way I could be, including going through our customers feedback and identifying how we could make our product more useful. I was then presented with the statement, \"sometimes, even if we know we can do something to improve the customer's experience, we simply don't because it means they will pay for our service longer waiting for it.\" I'm not sure why, but this statement bothered me so much, so I left for a new job.\n\n **Second Job:**\n\nMy second job was as a SRE/DevOps Engineer. It seemed like a great opportunity since I could essentially help both the company and the people with it. I could be creative and build tools that hopefully, would benefit everyone. However, while I got to program/code to some degree, most of my job was watching dashboards and rerouting phone calls. Eventually, some of the team took to watching movies or playing video games all shift (and in some cases, bring in their drones) whenever the manager wasn't there due to the sheer amount of down time they had. I quickly watched my team grow in frustration with the way the team was managed, and over my time there, 75% of my team had either left or had been fired (largely due to growing disgruntlement with the way things were). My manager frequently skipped my 1 on 1's with him and eventually, it came to a point where I'd only see him at bi-monthly intervals. I become something of a heads down programmer on the team, building random project and random project, hoping that eventually, someone would pick something up. Finally, I realized no one would, because I was the only one who could code and was willing to. I don't know if my code was good or bad. I just knew everyone was disinterested. So, I tried to move back to a software development team.\n\n**Third Job:**\n\nMy third job was something of a relief for me. I got to develop for a customer facing set of services, and I truly don't think I've ever been so happy for an extended period of time working in my life. There were always things to learn, always ideas to be discussed. and always opportunity for improvement. I think 90% of what I learned as a developer today, was through that team. I did everything I could for the team, and ultimately got a promotion for it. That said, it didn't matter that I got a promotion, because I simply loved the job. Additionally, it was through this job I realized the importance of negotiation of your salary. Mine had been so far off the mark that my team/manager grew concerned for me and fixed it (this was a huge fix). For the first time ever, I felt like I was in a place where I cared about the work, and my team cared about my input. I even led a few projects here and there as well. I truly envisioned staying with the company forever, and potentially becoming an engineering manager at some point because of it. The sheer amount of support I received was phenomenal. However, when COVID-19 hit, of course this shook things up a bit, leading to another re-org.\n\n**Fourth Job:**\n\nFor the first time, even though this was my second re-org, I often wondered why I was placed were I was. I often asked why at this point. Before my official start on my new team, I learned that I would be joining a failing, politically-corrupt team; that the current members of the team refused to teach, learn, or share any new information, because with doing so, it meant their jobs would be in jeopardy of being taken by younger developers. This was a team the entire company needed, but seemed to hate working with. I don't think I truly understood this at the time. That said, I learned why I was put on the team. I learned that I was put on the team solely because I was a DevOps Engineer in the past (work that I grew to hate by this point). The entire goal was to get people together to transform this team, despite expecting some of the other engineers there to push bad. Our tech stack was incredibly old, and the previous team members where clearly specialists. No one was willing to learn anything new. Only the newer members tried. This team was so under water, that asking anyone for help seemed like a huge burden on them. That said, what we heard, was in fact the case. The team eventually was split down the middle as ops and automation. Eventually, the team functioned as separate parts. It eventually became all about systems design and pushing for ideas that we could never get an unanimous decision on (almost always 50/50). Eventually, I had stopped coding entirely, and a bulk of my job had become manual labor (yes, turning devices on and off). I have been a \"software engineer\" for several months on this team, but I've never felt so distant from it. So, as you'd expect, I decided to leave to a more development centric team.\n\n**Today:**\n\nI am posting this because I genuinely want some advice on how to proceed.",

        "content": "From the perspective of a mid/senior engineer who has spent the last 4-5 years as a full-stack generalist, I'm realizing that the tech industry currently favors specialists. And why wouldn't it? Why would someone hire a top-tier React dev when their company is looking for a Java dev and there are dozens of top-tier Java devs in the interview loop? I think this is happening because of the layoffs, and I don't know how soon it will recover. Perhaps specializing will be very important until 2025 or even 2026.\n\nHere's my hot take: A lot of generalist engineers always come to these threads and say that being a generalist is great. But a lot of these generalists succeeded in the biggest tech bull market. So I feel like these takes have \"survivorship bias\". Kinda like hearing \"I made a successful career as a generalist and I've seen lots of successful generalist engineers so you should do the same\". Maybe this advice worked from the 2010s - the 2020s, but it just isn't useful anymore. Specializing in a specific field (be it frontend, backend, mobile, systems, ai/ml, data engineering, ar/vr, etc.) is very important for getting those interviews.\n\nSpecialization is also happening with FAANG companies now. This didn't exist before because there were more generic interview loops.  All you had to do was LeetCode. But now, that's changed. Google does a team match before the final round. So you only get an interview after a hiring manager already screened your resume. And if the HM is looking for SRE, but you have React.js experience, you probably won't get a callback. Facebook also has specific interview loops based on the role (frontend, backend, mobile, SRE, ar/vr, systems) you are applying for.\n\nI wish it weren't the case but this is just what I've observed. Thank you for coming to my ted talk. Would love to hear thoughts about this from other experienced engineers. Is the tech market shifting, or am I just way off base here?\n\nEDIT:\n\nFound a comment that describes what I mean by specializing.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/12sipub/comment/jgzi6u3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n\nI've copied the full comment here:\n\n\"I think it's naive to think that experience in a certain ecosystem doesn't matter. It's not about languages, but a lot of people (mostly on Reddit) try to pretend it is. \n\n[Note: When I said \"top-tier React dev\", I was referring to someone who understands the entire frontend JS ecosystem including TypeScript, State Management, Rest/GraphQL APIs, NodeJS, NPM, etc. I did not mean someone who only knows React. IMO, you can't be a \"top-tier React dev\" if you don't know the technologies/frameworks/tooling related to it.]\n\nI'm a \"Java developer\" but there are actually 3 components:\n\n- The language: not relevant. What I know about Java you can probably pick up 90% in a few weeks. Heck; I work mostly in Kotlin nowadays.\n\n- The tooling, libraries and frameworks: massively relevant. 15 years of working with Spring for instance isn't something you make up in a year.\n\n- The type of software I build: massively relevant. There is a huge difference between the type of things a back-end dev builds compared to front-end and embedded. And even within back-end the type of work I do is generally different from what a wordpress developer does.\n\nI'm sure it's a tough pill to swallow for a lot of people, but there is a reason so many companies want applications to be a close match to what they currently need. The larger the distance the higher the risk that you won't be productive before you eventually leave.\n\nThere is an experience bias in Reddit where a lot of people have mostly experience with junior roles. No one is going to want a new grad to have stack specific experience because it's not relevant. But for a very senior IC who's expected to explain to others how things work, them not having that actual experience means they won't be able to fill that role for an extensive amount of time.\"",

Please hint at your path if you have a moment.  \n  \nAnyone else in late career contemplating how they got to this wasteland where as an individual contributor, you are tired and no longer willing to invest the effort to go to the next rung?  Companies are just NOT willing to invest in their people and without reciprocation from them, it is all about self-motivation.  Earlier in my career, I never let this bother me and forged ahead.  But now, 20 years on, I have a handful of years left until I am probably forced to retire. Now that I can \\_possibly\\_ reach the star level of principal, I can't really get motivated.  When I was younger, I saw older developers become jaded and I said I would never become that.  Now here I am with similar weariness and a bit of anger.\n\n  \nLong ago I fell into software development because I was obsessed with understanding computers and how they work.  \n\nIt wasn't about developing a well-paying career.  I was mostly concerned with mastery of something I felt was worth learning about.\n\nNow that I've been doing this work since about 2001, I find I am just not interested in architecture nor being a \"leader\".  \n\nI stopped to examine why I feel this way.  Is it imposter syndrome?  Is it lack of confidence?  Is it lack of mastery?\n\nI have assessed the following list of real possibilities:\n\n1.   I have learned to hate software development in the corporate environment.  Politics, Agile performed poorly, the pressure of shareholders from the top have all conspired against my love.\n2.  I am not good enough to be a principal.  On code reviews, I am always missing some detail (the scanners catch code complexity, places where I could have applied code re-use, etc., missing a SOLID principle here and there)\n3. I've never stayed long enough at any one company to develop deep and wide domain knowledge.  Either the companies  technical areas were silo'd, the opportunities were there but the pay wasn't increasing with inflation...so hop and skip every two to three years.\n4. Lack of deliberate investment in my career. I just don't have the motivation to invest in tech stacks that change every couple of years.  Sure, the stack itself isn't the basis for a principal - however, the stack has impact on other decisions, practices, and types of companies.\n5. Now that certain technical areas are like a natural extension of my brain, the management wants me to spread out my focus into say, front end.  Fighting back seems pointless.  I learn just enough to be a mediocre front end dev and then I get stuck doing that work for awhile until I get the chutzpah to fight back and go back to my better skillset, the back end.\n6. As a woman, I find that there is covert and overt prejudice.  Investing in me requires some kind of mentoring and it is always a male who has no interest in doing so.  As I become less \"sexually viable\", this becomes more the case year after year.  I stopped trying to develop advocates and just do the work.  I know this is dumb.  I am human though, and banging my head on brick walls over the years has been...a test of endurance.\n\n**EDIT/Update**:  I am humbled by the responses here.  Very thoughtful, inspired and concrete ways I can approach my career.  I cant thank you enough.  I had no idea how angry and defeated I had let myself become. \n\nI have so much joy and contribution I can give once I get past this state of being.  \n\nAn emotional tide has washed over me as I remember the passion and interest I once had.

        "content": "So, I've been at my current company for almost 6 years now. It's a big multi-national corporation and I've had the chance of moving laterally across different Business Units and coding in different projects. For the past 3 years I've been working on this BU where I've moved up from SW Eng to a SW Architect (which is basically more design / technical roadmap & mentoring than actual coding).\n\nThe problem is that I've hit the ceiling- in terms of learning and career progression.  Let me explain. For better or worse, I believe I know the current product inside-out and there are no new things for me to learn. Also, even my slightest attempt to introduce new tech, that would improve some of our performance issues, gets blocked by management due to business priorities... In addition, there's no other technical position above my current one that I could move up to (the company is more management oriented when it comes to carving out employees' career paths) and moving to another BU is (for the time being) not feasible.\n\nOn the other hand there are some good things stemming from my current situation. For one, there's no stress at all. I'm totally autonomous, work on my own pace and have no LM pushing deadlines down my throat. Of course, there are project deadlines but my point is that I'm handling them myself- don't have a manager above my head constantly asking for updates and what not. This situation leads to me having a great deal of freedom in the way I work also allowing me to work remotely (even pre-COVID19) whenever I want. This also leads to me being able to completely shut off when I log off and not work outside my normal working hours (I mention this as an advantage because I understand that this is a huge deal in our industry).\n\nAs the title says I'm torn as to what my next step should be. That's why, in an effort to maybe clear things up a bit,  I'm seeking other experienced devs' input on my situation.\n\n**Option #1:**\n\n\\- Stay at my current job. This would allow me to (probably) coast for the rest of my time here and enjoy a totally autonomous, relaxed, low-stress way of life; three elements that are not that easy to find in the industry. As far as the cons go, well, they were pretty much explained above.\n\n**Option #2:**\n\n\\- Move to a new company as an Engineering/Tech Manager. This option would capitalize on the skills I've gained in my current position (tech management of a distributed team, people and tech managing of teams etc). **Pros**: More pay (for some reason management pays more, on avg, than a technical role), more autonomy than a s/w eng. position; better chances of climbing that career ladder as more positions are available to managers (I'm a type A personality...); more impact (?) as I will have a saying on key product/strategy decisions; less stress than an IC (I'm not really sure of this but I think that,on average, the stress of actually building the product is less than managing the guys who build the product); pay is more than an IC **Cons:** I'm not really sure that spending most of my day in meetings and creating ppt presentations will make for an interesting day to day job; not that many open positions for eng. management where I live (this means that If one gets fired there won't be many other similar jobs to go to); Less flexibility than IC in terms of remote work, time off, leave etc\n\n**Option #3:**\n\n\\- Move to a new company as an IC. **Pros:** Will learn new stuff/technologies and day to day will be more interesting than being a manager; More flexibility wrt working from home, working hours etc; Not (much) overtime; Because of the previous points, I reckon that my way of life will be more stable (in contrast to being a manager where there's a tendency to work past 5/6pm); generally, I like experimenting with new technologies and I like implementing mini projects on my spare time so I think by doing that professionally, it'll be a good use of my time **Cons:** less pay than a manager (again this is due to the country/market I'm in), will probably not be that much autonomous due to having a manager above my head and will for sure not be that much autonomous as I currently am, I think that the rush from using new technologies, and building exciting stuff will eventually fade away and in the long run this position will end up being only about fixing bugs. This means that I'll eventually have to move to a new job thus being part of a huge rat race; higher stress- associated with having to keep up with deadlines; unless this job's about a product/service that I'll be heavily invested in (slim chances), I think I'll not be having such big of an impact and will be just another cog in the wheel; I believe I won't ever be *that* good so as to climb to any position. This is due to the fact that there are other devs who are better than me and will have more experience in the new company.

The decision was originally made so I could both focus on my mental health (uncovered ADHD) as well as see what would happen if I focused on something of my own for a long period of time. I had been saving for quite a while so I thought I'd be perfectly fine with the worst case scenario of waiting out the upcoming \"recession\" in 2023.\n\nNow I'm looking to get back into the tech industry (full stack or backend services mainly) and I do technically meet the requirements for *many* roles. But with the immense competition in the current market, I don't stand out as the \"best pick\" on paper no matter what (in my opinion).\n\nThus I'd like to ask: **Have you gone through a similar experience before? How did you navigate back into your former career OR how did you pivot to a new career?**\n\nAs bonus details:\n\n* It's not monetarily viable for me to wait out the market until, say, next year\n* In addition, I've made neat advancements in the game dev space but there aren't many relevant doors in that direction (yet) and I'd like to focus this post on the main career topic\n* Furthermore, perhaps I just need a reminder that I should reach out to my former network (even if I haven't spoken to them in years whatsoever) and/or keep massively cold applying the entire time\n* Finally, I may just be overthinking things.

They knew the product inside and out.  They knew the companys domain knowledge better than the devs.  They catch things the devs never considered and are a tremendous asset to this company. Over the years they adopted automated testing.  I thought it was a useful but costly process to create and maintain automated tests.\n\n2nd company: Quarter of the revenue and employee size as 1st company.  QA is insistent on writing automated tests.  Theyre made up of people who have made it no secret that they want to transition into full-time coders.  The QA team misses things (of course, so did us coders, definitely not putting the blame on them).  They do not catch as many bugs as 1st companys QA team.  They do not take on learning companys domain knowledge. Theyre not as good as the QA team from my 1st company, which is frustrating.\n\n\n\n\nAn example of what we went through recently is a new QA hire named, lets say, Percy.  All Percy wanted to do is code and not do manual tests.  Percy wasnt good at either.  Percy kept bugging the dev team with programming questions.  Our Product Owner was fed up with Percys performance that the PO even did manual testing since PO couldnt even trust Percy. Our Engineering Manager finally told Percy to focus more on manual testing and devote 10% of their time to writing automated tests.  Percy quit.\n\n\n\n\nMy question for this sub is:  are we hiring the wrong people or is my opinion of a companys QA department wrong/outdated?  1st company QA hires came from more of a tech support background.  2nd company QA hires come from more of a background in CS.  Our CTO has a big interest in automated testing, but I think its a Sunk Cost Fallacy.  The automated tests are awesome when they catch things, but its rare and IMHO not worth the cost so I do not share our CTOs opinion of them.\n\n=====================\n\nEDIT:  Thank you so much for all of the comments.  Definitely walking away from this post with a different, better understanding of things.  Some more context and conclusions:\n\n* Everyone's assumption that QA is junior is 100% correct, including the QA lead.\n* Devs write unit and integration tests.  QA write automated tests in the form of E2E and Selenium tests.\n* Automated tests are important.  So is doing new, exploratory manual testing, which is what I'm not seeing from QA, so the devs need to do more of that work.\n* Never thought about manual and automated testing as 2 separate jobs.  That makes so much sense!\n* I think my conclusion that automated tests are a Sunk Cost Fallacy **at this current company** is because we're a very small company.  We just don't have the budget to fund proper automated testing.\n* I need to not use QA as a crutch and think about how to improve the quality of my output.  I was spoiled at my 1st company.",

Previously, I was a Project Manager for 4 years where I felt confident in my role. I took this new role for the challenge and growth opportunities, but Im currently feeling lost and regretting my decision.\n\nEven though I have a background in software engineering, I'm now tasked with responsibilities like creating infrastructure and architecture diagrams (without any architects or infrastructure team in the organization, just devs and QA), and reviewing source code (something I haven't done in years). These technical tasks are new to me, and theyre taking a lot of time to learn and complete, which has left several of my other responsibilities unaddressed. Despite my efforts to solve these technical issues, I havent been able to resolve anything.\n\nIn meetings, both technical and with users, I often feel out of my depth and it's been affecting my confidence. I feel like an idiot because Ive been asked technical questions in meetings that I couldnt answer.

Should I quit now?\n\nThanks for any advice or support.\n\nTL;DR: I know I'm partly to blame for accepting this role, as is my boss for offering it, but I never expected to be so heavily involved in technical tasks. I thought it would be more of a management role. These tasks are further complicated by the lack of documentation.

These certifications seem highly regarded and demonstrate hands-on knowledge in Networking. However, Ive heard mixed opinions on whether certifications alone are enough. Im wondering if employersparticularly in Canadavalue certifications more than a degree or diploma, or if a formal degree is becoming a necessity in the field.\n2. **Switching Programs**: Im seriously considering transitioning to the Computer Systems program at Durham College, as it focuses more heavily on Networking and Data Communications. This would allow me to stay in college while gaining foundational knowledge in Networking and pursuing certifications simultaneously.\n3. **Considering the Degree Route**: If a degree is a significant requirement for entering and advancing in the Networking field, I would also be open to leaving college and pursuing a university degree in Networking, Computer Science, or a related field. While this would be a big decision, Im willing to take this step if it provides a more secure and advantageous position in the industry.\n4. **Roadmap for Success**: For professionals currently working in Networking, Id love to know what the ideal path looks like based on your experience. Do employers focus more on certifications, degrees, or practical hands-on experience? How important are internships or co-op opportunities in securing that first Networking job?\n\nIm trying to ensure I make the right decisions now to build a strong and competitive career in Networking. Since I live in Canada, Im also curious about any region-specific advice regarding certifications, education, or job market trends.\n\nThank you for taking the time to share your insightsI truly appreciate your guidance and advice!",

        "title": "From Software to Networking (currently have an entry level tech job)",
        "content": "Hello fellow techies,\n\n   I would like some two cents on my quasi-unique situation. Initially, I started with JavaScript, React, SQL, Python, and I messed about with Linux to boot. Basically, I've had a couple of contractual gigs working with CRM & SEO. The two jobs were short-lived (seven and a half months total) but they are tech-adjacent roles that I believe helped me tremendously. Anyway, after many failed attempts at getting a developer role, I got a Software tester position, QA. The role is comparable to what an entry level help desk associate would make: $22. The role is a steppingstone, but I am not that sure that I can see the next level anytime to soon. The lion's share of developer roles at my company are all outsourced to countries that most have never even heard of. Of course, I know that one should test the market and see what is out there, but it does leave a sour taste in your mouth that there aren't many advancement opportunities within your company.\n\nMoreover, about a month ago I started to look into certifications and the various avenues I can take. After a bit of research, I decided to go for a CCNA. My thing is I don't want to cast a wide net and make more lateral career moves than necessary. With my current job I have had administrative, backend, api testing, and have been a part of many of releases. Pretty neat. My thing is if I get my CCNA, would I be able to transition into something higher than entry level? I hear a lot of people say the CCNA is a door opener but at the same time you have to start at the bottom sometimes. I am totally fine with that but I kind of already am doing that. In a nutshell what would be the fastest avenue (in your opinion) to get out of financial purgatory? Should I stick with software because I am already in it or make an attempt at networking and its neighboring fields? I have taught myself a lot to get to this position which got me out of the service industry, but I would say I am not a passionate techie. I see a field that is scalable and lucrative. Working to live and eventually financial freedom is my overall goal out of this. Lastly, any tips from the vets or people who have been in a similar situation, please, your advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading this long & drawn-out post.",
