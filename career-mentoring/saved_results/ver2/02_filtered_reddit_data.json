        "title": "All my IT friends discourage me (40M) from a career change to IT.",
        "content": "So, several times in my career over the years, I have contemplated a switch to an IT career. My focus would be networks and/or security. My father in an IT lifer and have several good friends in the IT field. I myself am an industry biologist. While I absolutely love science and am passionate about my work, some toxic work environments I have found myself in have pushed me to go in a different direction.  IT has always one of those things I think I could be really happy doing. I have always had a knack for understanding computers and how to troubleshoot them, I have never ventured beyond the hobbyist sort of computer nerd. I have always wanted to step up my credentials in my desired path and become a professional.\n\nEach time I try, my IT buddies are always a bit pessimistic. Before now, say about 10 years ago, the reaction was \"You will not make a lot of money starting out in IT\" and various other arguments about starting IT from the bottom. BTW, the money in biology isn't great either. But if your a science nerd like me, biological lab and field work can be rewarding. \n\nSo now, at 40, and again in a toxic environment and industry job, I am looking to make an exit and find another passion to pursue professionally. Now, my friends say that I have no chance to beat out a recent college grad with no experience for a job. The idea is that put a recent college grad with little to no xp vs a motivated 40 year old with little to no xp, HR will always go with the college grad, hands down. So it seems they are telling me that I missed the boat and stick to biology.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Would it be a waste of time to seek out some certifications and head for the nearest help desk wanted ad?\n\nEdit: Some great advice and feeling the reddit love. But want to clear up one topic. I know the money won't be anywhere near what I make now. I have an established career and some serious credentials backing up my experience currently. I am not looking for a change to make the money. I want the change to reinvigorate me. I want a job that I can learn and growth with in something new and exciting (for me). I also know that toxic work environments are everywhere. I just am just stuck in one right now and that is what is spurring the change.",

            "Dude what? You clearly don't like your current job much, what do you have to lose? Just do it. Also, your pay will scale very quickly with some experience.",
            "I\u2019ll play devil\u2019s advocate here. I think your friends have some valid but misdirected points.\n\n1. While it\u2019s not like this everywhere, there is absolutely toxic work environments/cultures in IT. Especially when I first stared in IT I had a few jobs that were based off of favoritism, there was a lot of gatekeeping by upper management, they expected us to do unpaid on-call, work holidays, stay late, etc. \n\nNot all companies are like that. I\u2019d wager most aren\u2019t, but they do exist and you probably won\u2019t know until your already in it. It tends to happen in more jr roles but can happen nonetheless. Read about burnout at FAANG companies as well.\n\n2. You could leverage your experience in some ways to go into IT, but without any verifiable skills/background you could be taking a cut from where your at pay and title wise. Not always the case, but it\u2019s a possibility.\n\n3. There are parts of IT that are boring. If you like doing field work, you may not like sitting in an office doing routine work.\n\n4. Understand IT, especially in the entry level area, is very oversaturated and competitive right now. That\u2019s not to say there is no chance to break in, but there is a industry around funneling people into IT and there has been a drastic spike of people trying to get into the field especially since Covid started. Look at r/Comptia, this sub, and some other IT related subs growth over the past few years and you\u2019ll see. The downside is employers see this. You\u2019ll be competing with people half your age and x2 your level of experience which can be frustrating. Being older though, you can bring a unique perspective to things. It can just take time to get in the door.\n\n5. Adding a bit to points 1 & 2. The pay can be a let down in those entry level roles. Your best bet is to get some experience then job hop to get a better salary. With that said, you could easily be in a position where you have to take a drastic pay cut just to get experience and depending on things outside of work (family, kids, living situation) this can be a downside. Very few come right into the industry and get 6 figure salaries. The majority have to climb there way up to that despite what YouTubers and tech articles will make you think.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that IT is a bad route. You can and should look at it, but be aware of what was mentioned above. I\u2019d say maybe get some certifications while you continue to work and see if you really like it. There is a huge difference between being a computer nerd and the workings of an enterprise environment. Certs can give you a brief taste of what you\u2019ll be doing and what to learn.\n\nWhatever you do, best of luck! IT can be very rewarding, but I try not to see it with rose colored glasses. There are plenty of 40 year olds that switch and do okay, you can too if you put in the work. I may be biased but I think you should give it a try if you\u2019re really passionate about it. I wish you nothing but success!",

If you're looking to get into the industry then an entry level help desk position or entry level tech position is a good place to start. If you're going to try any IT job then you gotta stay hungry. Don't get comfortable. You're there to learn on the job while continuing your education for about a year or two. If you don't have it then the A+ cert is a good place to start. The cert will give you more weight during the application process, it also tells employers that you understands the fundamentals of how a computer works and how to troubleshoot issues. If you're set on getting into networking then you can get your Network + cert and then the CCNA cert. Some may say to just go straight to the CNNA but that depends on your knowledge of how networking works. You can think of the Network + cert as a per-algebra class, it lays the ground work and fundamentals of networking.",

I just got picked to study for and take a certification exam on company time/funds.\n\nHR is not automatically going to go for the young graduate. A lot of these entry-level jobs have a set pay scale, so it's not like they feel like they have to pay you more for your non-industry experience. In my cover letter, and in my interviews, I was clear about why I want to get into IT and how my past experience (specifically years at various customer service jobs) makes me a good candidate for help desk work. I was also clear that I saw this as a stepping stone to other IT work, and they were totally fine with that.\n\nIf they'd hired me as a 22yo, they would not have had such good feedback for me, guaranteed. I still would have been diligent, but the last 20 years have taught me a lot about relating to people - that kind of thing they can't teach in school.

For sure, no way around that. Especially at your age. 40 is still young, but it doesn't matter what the crowd says lol. What does your body tell you when you get up in the morning and your bones are literally talking out loud to you. Sounding like a bowl of rice crispies just walking to the bathroom lol.\n\nIn your 20's, all-nighters and studying for 18+ hours a day wasn't a big deal. But try doing that NOW. I'm only 32, and if I miss just an hour of sleep I'm basically a zombie the next day. I know everybody wants to sound tough and say it's not that hard but lets be real here. Then on top of all that you have to account for family time and other life responsibilities. \n\nYES - There is a lot of money in IT IF you're willing to put in that kind of work, and not give up.\n\nYES - it can be rewarding if you like tech (only in certain fields though).\n\nYES - IT jobs can be pretty secure depending on what you pursue. \n\nBut again it really comes down to what you're capable, and willing to do in order to get there. \n\nThe only times I'd actively discourage it is if: \n\n1: You're not a driven person, you'll get nowhere in IT as it's heavily driven by the workers work ethics. If you're lazy, you're not gonna go anywhere unless you know someone. Tech isn't really something you can \"fall\" into. You have to search it out, make yourself competitive, and apply yourself on some level. \n\n2: If you're not wiling to learn with the evolving industry. Tech is one of the most evolving fields in the world, what you learn today has a chance to be completely irrelevant tomorrow. So if you want one of those \"sit in my chair and watch YouTube all day\" kind of jobs, either become a network engineer, or stay away. Even low end entry level Help Desk jobs do more work then that and deal with evolving tech.\n\n\\--------------------------\n\nTLDR; \n\nIf you're doing it for personal reasons, then go for it!

He continues to tell me how AI is what the new \"IT\" position is going to be and how it's all coding.\n\nWith that said, as stated earlier, are \"hardware\" IT positions truly dead and I am just reminiscing of old VHS videos I saw of server demonstrations from the 90s or is there truly a need for them?\n\nIf it is indeed the latter, what kind of positions should I be on the lookout for?\n\nSee I have always been interested in working on the hardware aspects of IT (such as messing with server racks and installation for example) and would like to find a career that revolves around that.

My first IT work experience came when I was in HS and worked as an Assistant IT specialist as an Intern for the HS I went to (which was for about 6 months). In that position, I did the bare basics, such as installing OSes into numerous laptops, doing CPU and RAM upgrades, as well as basic networking (such as Ethernet terminations and installation of switches and APs). The only other work experience I have was when I worked for a local computer store and shared my IT knowledge with other co-workers (as I was working in a marketing position during that time) and would \"assist\" on IT service calls or help out our IT service coordinator in whatever projects he needed assistance with (but this was all unofficial).\n\nLooking at [Indeed.com](https://Indeed.com) does make it seem like I am kind of screwed with the potential job I want given I don't have a BS in Computer Engineering, Science, or anything related to that. Additionally, it seems like there are very few jobs out there since it seems to range from being a \"computer repair tech\" for a small mom-and-pop store, and then straight to being a Software Engineer, but nothing in between it seems.

Project based role you'll move in racks work with other departments to get these racks into the building and spun up. This and Decom are the least technical and more laborous roles.  \n\n\nInfrastructure delivery deploy technician: You're gonna be helping install sometimes but most your job will be project management, troubleshooting link issues and network bricks/spines, your job is to get the network side of the building up and running to hand off to DCO.

You're freeing up expensive real estate for Infrastructure delivery to get better racks into that space for customers.

            "1. Yes, it is possible.\n\n2. I work as a cloud engineer for a CSP (cloud service provider). I started out working in-person, and then the job transitioned to a fully remote role during the pandemic. I am now 100% remote. I started working as a \u201chelp desk\u201d technician (though my work was more akin to remote desktop support) at 26, with no certifications or prior experience in IT. (I studied for the A+ and went through most of the Google IT Support professional certification prior to my interview, but I did not have these certifications when I got the job.) I\u2019ve since been promoted multiple times and have escaped the dreaded phone/chat queues.\n\n3. I work 40 hours per week, Monday through Friday. I have occasional on-call work (one week every 3-4 months).\n\nI agree with one of the other commenters that working remote full-time in IT will be difficult to do if you\u2019re also trying to juggle childcare at the same time. Although you would be working from home, you would still be working a full-time job. There is no way to perform both roles well simultaneously. Your work will suffer, and you won\u2019t be able to give full-attention to your child.\n\nYou would be half-assing both roles.\n\nI don\u2019t think IT is the career you\u2019re looking for if you\u2019re hoping to find a remote job that you can juggle with caring for your daughter. Something else in tech, like a freelance dev job (where you set your own hours and/or work a contract for a finished product vs. working on a team with set full-time hours) might allow you to work a more flexible schedule. It would be very hard to break in to that kind of job without any experience though. \n\nGood luck with finding a job that allows you to live \u201cthe dream.\u201d",
            "It is definitely doable but it will be difficult. 29 years old really isn\u2019t that late to the game, it\u2019s more the issue of trying to break into the industry in a full remote capacity without any degree or relevant experience. \n\nTo succeed what I would recommend is skippping the generic IT route (systems administrator style positions) and trying to get straight into a specialized junior position like DevOps or Security. \n\nI would start with some AWS certifications. Study and learn and see if it interests you. Certs are a great way to get something on your resume when you have no experience or degree. They absolutely will not guarantee you a job but they can definitely help and they\u2019re a great learning opportunity.",

The good thing about IT is that you can jump into it at any age if you start and keep up with training because it changes so fast.  The bad thing about IT is that it changes fast and requires a lot of upkeep.\n\nThe key to working from home is finding the right culture.  There are other positions directly and indirectly with IT that can support working from home \\*IF\\* the company culture allows it.\n\nProject Management / Business Analyst - These roles work from home as they mostly involve meeting with people to understand and get updates.  (PM Role could be tricky, but if it's an IT based PM Role, working from home is doable)\n\nCorporate Procurement  / Supply Chain - Again, easy to work from home, somewhat lower barrier to entry if making a carrier change.  Again, can be focused on IT if you want as well.  My organization has IT Procurement people within the larger procurement org because IT procurement can be complicated especially when it comes to licensing.\n\nThe key to the above, in my opinion, is finding a large, preferably multi-national, organization that has figured out work from home during covid so you're not pressured to come back because of lack of bodies in the building.

Sure, I can go to Bali and work, but now I'm in paradise, stuck staring at a laptop screen, indoors, for 8 hours of the day. I'm also on a different time zone than the rest of my team so I'd be getting up at 2am for meetings.\n\nIf your job is to write news articles or some other social media type job(traditional nomad jobs), then I imagine you can make it work. For it/dev jobs that require critical thought, focus, a comfortable workstation etc, it's just not feasible\n\nIt's not just the time off task either, it's the time it takes to get back on task.\n\nIf you're not disciplined enough or not able to work undistracted, working from home will be detremental to your career and ruin remote work for the rest of us.\n\nTons of remote people aren't half as productive as they think they are because they are constantly interrupted.",
            "I have a degree in IT related field, but I want to chip in still.  \n\n\nNone of my job interviews even mentioned my studies or what I actually learned there. So this is not important at all. All employers cared about is what am I doing now and what do I know. This, in first interview can be tested by asking simple related questions to the job, and of course on second interview it's tested by some sort of assignment. So this is what determines if you get a job or not.  \n\n\nI was working full time at the office, but as pandemic hit, March 2020, our company went remote, and still haven't returned.   \nhowever, I recently had some talks, because I am switching jobs. Most of them now offer fully remote or semi-remote roles, with 1/2 days in the office if you are needed.   \nNow I got an offer from company with ability to work fully remote. They have office which is quite far for me and not feasible to commute. So this was quite big point in my talking to company.  \n\n\nI seen some HR on YouTube mentioning that you should not ask this question on the interview, but you most definitely should do and set your lines. If company doesn't want you because you want to work remote, do you really want to join that company?  \n\n\nAbout working hours, my country is 40h/week 8-17, with 1h lunch (some companies have less restrictive guidelines as the one I work now is 8-17 / 9-18 etc., as long as you do the work)   \nBut if you plan to be unavailable in certain times, I think it's worth mentioning too, and talk it out with employer, but this is not that important in my eyes, as you can do your job more flexible and in other hours.",

            ">Does anyone have a remote IT job without a degree and/or with a late start (e.g. career change)?\n\nMany do.  E.g. since COVID-19 my job is thus far been almost entirely remote ... only been to the office two times over that entire period ... that might change, ... but thus far for most in tents and purposes it's \"remote only\" ... though that may change ... and some of my peers have gone officially and totally remote only - notably moving so far away that remote only is required.\n\nI also know someone who, in their 50s, a B.S. degree and in a hard science from decades earlier, but not at all IT/Engineering/Computer/Information related - they switched careers - also from something not at all IT - and are now 100% remote, and are in fact in the process of moving where they'll have to be 100% remote only.\n\n>best option if I want to work remotely\n\nMaybe ... maybe not.  Communication costs are cheap.  Consequently there's potentially always risk of who will do it for the cheapest anywhere on the planet.  But legal and other considerations may often limit that ... at least somewhat - but not entirely ... and even within a single country that might matter, as cost of living and compensation may vary greatly within a single country.  Will employer pay same regardless of employee's location ... or not at all.  Practices vary a lot by employer.  It may be a few years before that mostly settles out and we see what becomes \"the norm\".  I think in the meantime a lot of employers - and employees - are still figuring it out and \"experimenting\" with it.  Time will tell.  Likewise with the remote/not/mix ... who knows how that settles out, and may vary a lot by employer, position, nature of work, etc. ... and maybe even down to individual employees - who works better more efficiently remote vs. not ... or even based on what their tasks of the day may be.\n\n>earn money while taking care of my daughter at home\n\nWell, work is work - don't expect you'll necessarily be taking care of your daughter *and* working at the same time ... but in a lot of cases remote work may offer more flexibility on timing and such, and might be able to more-or-less keep an eye on your daughter, take breaks with her ... lunch ... way shorter commutes, etc.  But you probably won't be full time watching her *and* working *at the same time*.\n\n>BUT I know the reality is often far from what you imagine\n\nYeah, thoroughly research it before you dive in.  Many just think naive stuff like, \"Oooh, bit 'o training with some certs or code camp or whatever, maybe few months to half a year's experience ... easy 6 figure or more, just sit by computer, look at screen, type some stuff in once in a while - count me in!\".  And many will be highly disappointed that it ain't that easy.  The body of knowledge one will need to know and master to get compensation in/around that range is quite non-trivial - can easily be compared to getting a strong B.S. degree from a good school in a solid IT program.  'Bout the damn fastest I've ever seen someone make such a change took them about 1 to 1.5 years of vigorous solid full-time self-study to break into IT - going without job that whole time so they could focus on learning the skills they needed to learn to get into IT ... and then from there took 'em about 1.5 years to be solidly into 6 figure range ... but this was not your typical individual, this was someone not only highly motivated, but damn smart and fast on the uptake.  So ... that person would probably be about your top 2% or higher of typical career change folks jumping into IT.  Most take more like about 4 to 6 or more years on average to do what that person did in around 3.  And many will never make it.  Many will get into entry level positions in IT that are close to minimum wage ... and 4 ... 5 ... 6 or more years later, they'll be griping her on r/ITCareerQuestions about how they can't get ahead and are still where they started ... not everyone is up for the challenges.\n\n>Is it possible to have a remote IT job without a degree and/or with a late start?\n\nAbsolutely.  E.g. see example cited further above ... and implied caveats.\n\n>If you are one of them, what career do you have and how do you achieve it?\n\nThere's example person I cited above.  Their position is approximately - functional description - DevOps / Linux sysadmin / \"Engineer\\*\".\n\nThere's also myself ... career, I think I'd describe it as DevOps / Linux sysadmin - how I achieved it - much longer path ... basically had fair bit of electronics/engineering background ... but no degree.  After a while got my foot in the door with IT.  Always continued to *also* learn a lot on my own.  So, between my own stuff, and work experience, over time progressed to role that was primarily UNIX sysadmin, and continued to grow and progress from there ... Linux, DevOps, etc. - with lots of relevant skills along the way, e.g. out-program and out-automate most of my typical peers - but definitely not all of all of the time on everything.  Also, most of the time I've got much deeper and more thorough knowledge of Linux and most networking matters than most of my peers most of the time - again not all of them on everything all of the time.  So, anyway, I'm well able to use and leverage those skills - and they're quite valuable to my employers ... and I continue to grow and develop my skills.  It's not like you just learn it and you're done.\n\n>How many hours do you work / week? And what is your day like?\n\nBasically full time - hours usually approximately reasonably close to 40 ... as a general rule I try to keep it fairly sane - like under 45 hrs./wk. - it's not like you can get that time back later - life and other stuff continues to move right along - with or without you.  I've sometimes worked weeks in excess of 100 hours ... but those were rather extreme and mostly pretty short-term exceptions.  Have had some jobs that got too out-of-hand-too regularly.  One such job, they wouldn't back down - I gave notice and left ... and in that case rather than the customary 2 weeks notice, I gave 'em 80 working hours notice - seemed most highly fitting and appropriate under the circumstances.\n\nAlso, most IT positions will involve some on-call.  Depending mostly upon and employer and mangers and such, that can be quite reasonable and not at all too burdensome.  Or it can be totally out-of-control time to find another job.  I've turned down at least one job that had on-call requirements that were pretty much nuts - oncall half of all time, with a 10 minute leash - f\\*ck that - not living my life like that.\n\nDay like ... well, alas, this got too long, so ... splitting it ... remainder will be in [my reply comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/pfr85q/does_anyone_have_a_remote_it_job_without_a_degree/hb751k3/) to this.\n\nEdit - and edited to link the reply comment",

        "content": "I\u2019m 32, soon to be 33, working full-time as an Accounts Payable Specialist in California, earning $28 an hour for 40 hours a week, but I\u2019m feeling burned out. I went to community college, earned my associate\u2019s degree in business administration, then transferred to study accounting. However, I took a break that stretched to nearly two years. Now, I\u2019m interested in transitioning to tech, ideally starting in a help desk role to explore my options.\n\nShould I leave my job to focus on tech certifications, or go back to college, switch my major to general business, and study full-time? I\u2019m also wondering if California has good entry-level help desk opportunities. Once I get my certifications, how can I leverage my accounting experience to make myself more appealing for help desk or IT roles? Should I include my accounting experience on my resume, or is it irrelevant? Also, I\u2019ve noticed that some entry-level help desk positions require over a year of experience but offer little pay\u2014why is that?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. Thank you!",

            "When I was 32 I went back to school for a post-graduate program in IT Infrastructure. When I finished a year later, I got a job as an IT Technician almost directly out of school. I'm now 34 and have 1.5 years of work experience. It's going well, the pay is decent. I get to work with a lot of different technologies, and I have high hopes for moving up to become a network or system administrator. It's a good path to take. I'm in Canada btw.\n\nHowever, before I ever went back to school for IT, I actually spent several years exploring a lot of different technologies. I learned to code in multiple languages and built a bunch of different projects, I played with electronics and Arduino boards, I learned SQL and database programming, learned Linux and actually got a basic Linux cert, and took apart a lot of computers. I did all kinds of little learning projects. So when I finally went back to school, I knew I had a knack for figuring out how to make stuff work and I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my working life doing that sort of job.\n\nI recommend spending about a year exploring technology and studying for your A+ while you work your day job. Find out if it's the right thing for you and whether you actually enjoy it or not. Because if you do go into IT, you'll start at the bottom, both in terms of pay and prestige. If you're going to take a pay cut to enter a new field, you should really want to do it for reasons other than the money. The pay ceiling in IT can be quite high, but you can also start out quite low. IT isn't something you should pursue purely because you think it's lucrative.\n\nIf you spend a year learning more about tech and you manage to get your A+ then you could start applying for helpdesk jobs while maybe going back to school for an AS in IT. Best case scenario is that you get a job with just your A+, but even if you don't get one right away you can start your college program with a solid foundation under your belt already. If you end up finding that IT isn't your thing after spending some time doing independent learning, then at least you'll have some new skills and be a bit more digitally savvy in your day job.\n\nGood luck.",

I\u2019ve spent a lot of time using accounting software, Excel, and doing some low-level troubleshooting.\n\nI\u2019ve jumped from job to job for a while now, and none of them have really clicked for me. That\u2019s why I\u2019m set on making a change, and IT is where I\u2019m focused.\n\nWhy IT? One of the few aspects I\u2019ve liked about accounting involved the tech side, and I am very curious to learn more, especially because I believe it would be a useful skill to have. Working remotely when given the chance has been great too and I\u2019ve heard IT offers a lot of remote opportunities. On top of that, my experience with IT departments has shown me they tend to be more laid-back and down-to-earth, which would be a nice change from the stiff corporate environment I'm used to. Plus, IT seems like one of the fastest fields to break into compared to others\u2014and right now, time efficiency is a big priority for me.\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve seen online, the typical path to breaking into IT without a degree seems to look something like this:  \n**A+ Cert \u2192 Network+ Cert \u2192 Help Desk Job \u2192 CCNA Cert \u2192 Climb the Ladder**\n\nI\u2019ve also read that while you don\u2019t\u00a0*need*\u00a0the A+ or Network+ certs to sit for the CCNA, they\u2019re highly recommended for someone like me who\u2019s starting from scratch. Is that right? If so, do you have any recommendations for the best resources to get these certs? I\u2019ve seen a few options\u2014short-term college programs, Udemy courses, CompTIA or self-study with YouTube videos\u2014but I\u2019m not the best at self-motivation. I do better with imposed structure and outside accountability. Given that, what path would you say is the most time- and cost-effective for someone in my situation?\n\nOne more thing: how long do you think it would realistically take to get the necessary certs and land a help desk job? Ideally, I\u2019d love to have one locked down by the end of this year.\n\nI\u2019d appreciate any advice or insight you can offer. <3\n\n**TLDR:**\u00a0I'm looking to transition into IT from an accounting background with no prior IT experience, and I\u2019d appreciate advice on the best, most cost-effective path to certifications and a help desk job within the year",

            "It's possible to study and pass the CCNA without any other cert or experience, but it will be challenging, and can quickly become discouraging.\n\nThe A+ is the \"Jack of all trades, master of none\" cert of IT. I think it does a good job at covering a bit of everything, but it doesn't teach you anything useful for a job, imo, other than perhaps having a troubleshooting methodology. You'll learn more within a couple weeks on the job than you will spending a month or more studying for A+. \n\nUnfortunately, you might still have to take these exams (2 cores and 2 exams for A+). I say unfortunately, because I wish everyone could just go over the content and not take the exams. \n\nWhile Cisco CCNA is an entry level cert, it goes far more in depth into many concepts than Network+ does. Net+ is a walk in the park compared to the CCNA. I would only recommend the CCNA for people who are actually interested in the field of networking. For general support roles, I believe Net+ is good enough, as it gives you a decent overview of the main protocols, topologies, how to troubleshoot networks, etc.\n\nDon't get any advanced certs (like Cisco CCNP) without experience. It will look irrelevant on your resume. Also, don't make the costly mistake of collecting certs obsessively, like many people who don't have experience do. Certs are great, when done right, but they do not make up for the lack of experience or even the lack of a relevant degree in some cases. \n\nAlso be aware that you will most certainly be making (a lot?) less money with your first role in IT, since it will probably be something like working at the help desk, an entry level field tech role, or something similar. \n\nI'd say start with reviewing the content for A+ (grab an up to date book from the library, watch Professor Messer's videos on YT). Do some research on job opportunities (descriptions, requirements) where you live.  PLEASE GO OVER THE WIKI that someone linked here.\n\nIt's difficult to decide on a path at this stage. You might think that networking would be it, only to find out after learning a bit more that you'll probably hate it. Who knows. \n\nOne last thing, cybersecurity and cloud are trendy and often mentioned on social media and other platforms. It sounds great, interesting roles, good money...but these are NOT entry level specialties.",

Many run a sort of managed service provider division which would be a fast way to get your feet wet for little to no additional cost, and maybe no pay change.\n\nAnd as /u/SassyZop said, ERP stuff would be a great way to take your accounting knowledge and get in with any level of the stack. As an IT consultant myself I work elbow to elbow with teams that manage various systems, internally and across environments that use SAP. Coming from the other side you would have an advantage in understadning the user story there to a point if you play your cards right.",

I took some elective classes for cybersecurity(networking/ aws) and I've been studying to get certifications. But now Im just seeing way too many people getting laid off and unable to get back in. I just don't want to waste my time.. im about to hit my mid 30s and I don't want to invest all this time and money to later be unemployed and still in the kitchen.

            "I'm in the same boat as you. Over 50, this is my second career after 20 years bartending, after 12 years of freelance web design.\n\nCurrently working a pretty decent, remote help desk position (with no certs or previosu help desk experience). Just passed my Sec+, and looking to move into Security.\n\nHere's what I know so far...\n\n* When I look on Linked In, there are MANY security related jobs including SOC L1 and above.\n* Security is a general term with dozens of not hundreds of positions that cover anywhere from SOC, Pentesting, Governance-Risk-Compliance, Budgeting and economics, OSINT investigation...I mean the sky is literally the limit. So many ways to go. Personally love OSINT and want to see what I can do with it.\n* Just getting a Sec+ (or any cert) doesn't mean recruiters will be knocking down your door. You have to put the fundamentals on top of it to get a decent SOC job. TryHackMe and HackTheBox have some pretty good SOC related courses.\n* When I started my web design business, it was 2008. Everyone and their mother was trying to be a web designer back then. It was saturated. On top of that,  the world economy was shit. But I knew there were still people out there with money, and I was specializing in a specific thing and there was a need. Starting a business is hard, and there's NEVER a perfect time or perfect economy.   I made it work by becoming a better option and marketing myself well. I feel the same way about this. I need to become a better candidate than the average applicant with nothing but certs.\n\nAbout all that \"passion\" shit. I HATE that word now. If I wanted to follow my passion, I'd be a house music DJ and professional bourbon sampler at a beachside bikini and buffalo wing bar.\n\nI like IT and technology  in general. I like learning about it. Many things about it fascinates me and it seems I have a pretty good aptitude for it and learning new things. I've spent hours watching keynotes just because I find the shit interesting. I watch tech shows and podcasts more than streaming shows and movies. As far as things I would do for money, I think this is pretty awesome and it has opportunity.\n\nIf I wasn't doing this for a living, I'd still probably dabble with my home lab, and learn how to do stuff out of curiosity, but is it my passion? As in would I do it for someone else for free just because I love it so much? F\\*ck no. I'm here to make money. I will do and learn and become what I need to be to make that money..same as when I was a bartender. I loved tending bar. It was fun, I was living in Vegas and living like a true degenerate. It was great. But the money is part of what made it great.  I became the bartender I needed to be, and moved to where I needed to move, to make maximum money and have maximum fun.\n\nI see this (any job) the same way.  What do I need to do to be that guy that employers are looking for, and beat out the competition for that job, and then be able to kick ass and back it up?  Great, I'll do that.\n\nCould I do that for any job? Nope. I like this one.",

            "> I've been seeing alot of youtube videos of layoffs in the tech field, and how hard it is for these people with years of experience to find a job.\n\nYour concern isn't about any specific field of but rather the exploitation of labor which capitalism demands.\n\nThe truth is that every single person with IT skills on the planet could be put to work today and there still would not be enough skilled workers to meet the actual demand for IT labor in the current market.\n\n> im about to hit my mid 30s and I don't want to invest all this time and money to later be unemployed and still in the kitchen\n\nThe difference between gaining IT skills and working physical labor is that if you treat your body well, in general if you don't develop some issue that hurts your mental faculties your mind will continue to function and even develop and thrive resulting in more skill thus more valued IT labor over time. This is not true for physical labor roles where your labor value tends to deteriorate over time.\n\n> I was watching an interview with one of the popular cybersec youtuber and even he was talking about how he personally know talented people who have been laid off and unemployed for months!\n\nThe problem with this is it is anecdotal. I'd question this data point along the lines of what niche roles these people hold, what actual employment opportunities they have attempted to seek and what market they are looking in. Cybersecurity is an incredibly vast field that is constantly developing and for which there are many, many open roles. I've personally seen very talented people be let go because they were unwilling to work within the business goals of a company.\n\nSomething you need to understand about publicly traded companies is that when \"the market\"/\"the street\" (Wall Street analysts) make a call about what they expect, and each company doesn't respond in kind, the value of the company stock is put at risk. For so many IT companies regarded as \"high growth\" the stock price directly reflects compensation rates for their highest paid employees due to the stock grants that are part of the employees' total compensation. So if Wall Street says they expect a company to justify their hiring over the last 8 quarters int he fact of the forecast of the next 4 quarters, depending on how aggressively they were hiring some companies may need to do a round of lay offs if they don't want their stock price to tank for the next 6-12 months. Here's the thing: just because the company is a \"tech company\" doesn't mean their layoffs are in their IT or engineering staff. For example, a tech company whose main revenue is around cyber security can't afford to let go of cyber security talent, because that's where their revenue comes from. However a company whose primary revenue comes from their CRM software business may be able to shed some of the roles within their security team without impacting their revenue.\n\nTalk to anyone who was mid-career during the 2008-2009 layoffs and ask them how long it took to start hiring back people they laid off. The similarities between the 2008-2009 and 2022-2023 labor downturns are uncanny for those of us who were there. The difference this time is that it was the tech sector rather than the financial sector who got hit the worst.\n\nThe point is that focussing on the current labor situation and social media personalities farming clicks isn't the best source for informing your own career. You should probably look in to the roles you are interested and get a better understanding of how they fit in to a business. This can help you understand which companies you should be seeking out, for example, highly regulated companies who sell services to the federal government or to medical or financial firms will have a huge requirement for meeting regulatory requirements mandated by law and when it comes to selling services to the federal government in particular these contracts tend to last a very long time, basically printing money *provided the firm can maintain their regulatory certification*. In these companies the cyber security domains of compliance and vulnerability management are critical for the business to maintain revenue. By contrast if you are a red-teamer/pen-tester at an e-commerce startup, if times get tough it's no skin off their back to let you go because they can always just rent the same skill set from a cyber security consulting firm (who will probably hire you for that contract after you're let go from the company).",
            "The amount of delusion people think of what it takes to get a cybersecurity job is truly amazing and I have to take my hat off to all these influencer ads that are being pushed to make it seem easy.\n\nNot only does it take grinding and learning multiple disciplines to become proficient in its also an extremely niche field so the amount of jobs will be even more competitive.\n\nMy advice would be to look into IT as a whole instead of a specific field. Work on your skillset and let your career take you where your true interest lie.",

You can go GRC/Auditing route which isn't technical, but... it's the least fun, but a foot in the door to then pivot.\n\nYou have to sacrifice a lot of evenings, time with friends, family to get to a level where you can sit at a desk and know exactly what you're looking at (or at least minimal training to get you up to speed). Theres a lot of competition right now from very talented indivuals who have worked in IT for a lot longer than I have who can't break in. I was carried completely by my passion for everything technological & my dedication to self-development - Which was all self funded & done during my lunchbreaks & evenings every day.\n\nIf you're only in it for the money, you won't go far in Cyber (if you get into at all) - Which there isn't anything wrong with, some people prefer to stay at the lower level jobs because less responsibility... Although in cyber you'll already have quite a high level of responsibility anyway.\n\nI'm all for people switching careers into IT, but if that spark ain't there; then guinely... I even wouldn't bother. For most people it's the helpdesk for a few years, which is already a painful process for a lot of people. Then over to network engineer/sysadmin role who then pivot with a small paycut over to Cyber because the higher level roles are more lucrative.\n\nBut hey if you're willing to spend time studying after work, grinding away & letting cyber be on the front of your mind most days whilst working the helpdesk, then Cyber is for you. As others have said, Cyber is just one small branch  of many on the tree that is Information Technology, don't fixate on this niche, who knows you might like Networking more.\n\nHope that helps!",

            "This showed on my suggested feed and since I'm in IT as well, here's my opinion.\n\nHaving cybersecurity as it's own field is disingenuous and damages the IT field and maybe even downgrades someone's real skill because they don't have some piece of paper that says they're good enough. They are one the same, where cybersecurity is an enhancement, or specialty that builds upon the foundation of IT.\n\nThink between nurses, doctors, and surgeons. They're all built upon the same field, same education, same degrees, but an enhancement of the previous.\n\nTidbit, we have a dedicated cybersecurity guy, cert and degrees, but he's worthless compared to our networking and systems guys that know the work, do the work, the full resposne stack. He's a glorified position that at best triages like a sudo manager.\n\nMy opinion, go for IT, but study and emphasize networking as the end goal. Get systems level experience in. Get it all. Then you'll be an effective cybersecurity.",
            "Hello all,\n\nSimilar question if someone is able to help :) \n\n  \nAs the title suggests I am keen on a career change into Cybersecurity and would like some advice on what roles I should begin applying for. \n\n  \nUp until recently I was working as Graduate Lawyer. I've had probably about 1.5yrs experience working in legal practice across a broad range of areas. Working in law I was faced with the realities of the profession and I realised I wasn't happy. In my experience, law is oversaturated with a poor ROI. No matter how hard one tries, personal and professional success isn't guaranteed. However, it's shown me how increasingly reliant we are on tech and sparked an interest/desire to up-skill in Cybersecurity. \n\n  \nIn saying that I hold the following:   \n1. Bachelor of Business (International Business) - also was awarded a Cert IV in International Trade and Dip in International Business during my first year  \n2. Bachelor of Laws  \n3. Graduate Diploma in Legal Practice; and   \n4. Security Clearance Neg Vetting 1\n\n  \nWork Experience was gained in diverse work environments and includes legal practice, the Army Reserves and luxury retail. \n\n  \nMy skillset is unique and easily transferable. Based on my experience I've got a strong customer service ethic, ability to learn fast, strong communication skills with an emphasis on translating tech info to non tech audiences, navigating high-pressure environments, managing competing deadlines and strong prioritisation skills - just to name a few. I am aware I lack the \"tech skills\", however,  I am enrolled in a Cert IV in Cybersecurity (100% Aus Government funded) to hone the technical and practical aspects.\n\n  \nMy question to the community is the following:  \n**1. What roles should I be applying for based on my experience?**   \n**2. If applying for an entry level position like a Service Desk Analyst, what steps should I be undertaking to go from that role to a role in Cybersecurity?**\n\n  \nAnyone who is in the same position, has done something similar, regardless of law or not, please share some advice as it would be appreciated! :)",

My current career has been in the trades but I've never really felt my heart was in it here and the thing I've always been good at and interested in was computers. I've really loved learning how to use Linux, program in python, Javascript, Java, html, and css. I've loved learning how the internet works, how to set up wired and wireless connections, networking in general. \n\nThe problem is, I'm still a novice in all of these compared to the professional IT community. I've felt like this was always my true calling, but I've tried University before and failed miserably except for my computer science and engineering class. I have no certifications, and feel very little desire to go to college. \n\nMy question is, where should I go from here? I am not interested in \"you'll never make it\" comments because that's just plain not helpful. What path should I follow to start a career in IT? Do I have to go to school to get anywhere or are the certifications more what I should focus on? If it matters the place I plan to start a career is in the Midwest. If I can make at least $60,000 a year after two to three years then I can be happy with that for a while. Where do I start, and what type of job should I go for? \n\nEdit: I have dabbled in a number of cloud, virtualization, computer image, network/user/computer/system monitoring and configurations.

The network admin at my company wanted to be an electrician originally, but found it was too tough to get an apprenticeship unless you put in several years of general labour. Went into IT and became a network admin after a couple years instead.\n\nDoing at least a 1 year accelerated college diploma in IT would be your best bet. Even better if you can do a 2 year program. But if you can't/won't do that, you can get the A+ and/or CCNA if you feel up for the challenge and try to leverage your work experience in a related trade (electrical?) to get you that first job.\n\nWhen I first started out I was interested in Linux and programming and all that stuff, even got a Linux cert. While it has been useful a few times to know what I'm doing in a UNIX environment, its maybe 1% of what I do overall. Nothing wrong with knowing Linux and being able to write a script (Python is good, PowerShell even better), but your best bet is to focus on core IT domains covered by the A+, make sure you have a decent understanding of the Windows operating system and the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, and have solid knowledge of the TCP/IP network stack.",

        "content": "Alright. \nThis is gonna be a long one so buckle up.\n\nI have seen countless post from people that fall into the following categories:\n\n1. \u201cI wanna get into IT but I have seen too many gloom and doom posts here and I am scared now\u201d.\n\n2. \u201cI want to get into IT but I wanna work remote, make over 100K, and be in cybersecurity\u201d.\n\n3. \u201cHow do I get into IT? What do I need to do?\u201d\n\n4. \u201cWhich degree should I get? Which certificate should I get?\u201d\n\nLet me start by saying I am not making fun of anyone or judging anyone. I am just hoping to help clear up some questions for people. \n\nIt has been said many times before but the wiki is the best place to go for all of your questions. You can find it here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/s/y0A6PVaYG8\n\nBesides that, here is all you really need to know about the above questions:\n\n1. Yes, the IT market is very saturated right now and very competitive. This does not mean that you are screwed if you are trying to get into IT. There are some places that are better for IT jobs than others and location plays a big part in it. \n\nThe market is also cyclical and it is unlikely that it will stay this way forever, but even if it does, if you work hard and push yourself you can make it happen.\n\nYou also need to take into account that lots of industries are suffering like this right now, not just IT, so making your decision solely based in that will not work out well.\n\n2. Roles this great do obviously exist, but they are NOT entry level roles. They are going to be senior level roles where the people filling them have 7-10+ years of IT experience already. \n\nDoes this mean you should give up? No. It just means you need to tailor your expectations. Get whatever entry level job you can get first (help desk, support tech) and work your way up and gain experience so you can make it to that dream job one day.\n\n3. The best advice I can give you for getting into IT is this:\n\nExperience > Certificates or Degree\n\nExperience is king and is what everyone is asking for. This is way just getting your foot in the door and getting a job is the most important. So you can start building experience. \n\nIf you cannot get that job then start home labbing. Set up equipment and mess with configurations and learn that way. If you cannot afford a home lab then there are free resources out there that can help you learn. For specifically networking, you could download Cisco Packet Tracer and build networks on that for practice. It lets you practice routing configurations and network architecture and all that great stuff. This is just one example, but there are other free resources like this out there depending on what side of IT you are looking to get into.\n\n4. This depends on the situation. If you get a degree, your best bet is almost always going to be getting a generic IT or CS degree. Speciality degrees (like cybersecurity) sound great but you want to focus on broad, foundational knowledge early in your career and then specialize later.\n\nSo if you want to get into cybersecurity you could get a general IT degree and then pursue cybersecurity certificates, for example.\n\nNow as far as certificates go, you almost always want to get your entry level certificates if you haven\u2019t already gotten into IT. Think CompTIA A+, Network+, and Security+.\n\nIf you have a solid foundation already and want to start specializing, then there are other routes as well (like CCNA for Networking or Azure/AWS certificates for cloud or PenTest+ for security). There are many more options than what I am giving you here but you get the idea.\n\nIf you want to get into IT, then go for it. The only thing stopping you is you. Don\u2019t let the doom and gloom scare you.\n\nMisc. Things:\n\n1. AI will not replace you, AI will change the landscape of how IT works but we will still be here. Other jobs will be replaced sooner than IT will (think low skill, low mental capacity type jobs).\n\n2. Cybersecurity is very rarely an entry level role. More than likely, you will have to get a regular entry level IT job and study up, get certificates, and pivot into cybersecurity.\n\n3. I recommend looking at the material for Tech+ and ITF+ from CompTIA if you have zero IT experience. They are their most basic certificates for IT. If you struggle with that material, that is not a good sign (this doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t get into IT, it just means that it will be much harder for you and it will take you longer to grasp concepts and material as you learn).\n\n4. IT is an industry that requires consistent learning (some people get away without doing this, but if you want to remain competitive, then you will be constantly learning). This means studying for certificates, learning new systems, learning new concepts, and doing it in your own time sometimes.\n\nI say this to get across the fact that if you are not truly interested in IT, you will probably see this requirement as a burden and it will turn you off from a career in IT (do not let this one issue stop you, just be aware of it).\n\n\nAll of this is to say if you are truly wanting to get into IT then go for it and work hard for it. Start with general knowledge and do not worry about specializing until you actually start your IT career. You got this!\n\n\nEdit: we are going to agree on Experience > Degree or Certificate, rather than Experience > Certificate > Degree\n\n\nEdit: if you do not like talking to people or are not interested in customer service type roles, IT might not be a great choice. A lot of entry level roles (like help desk) and even senior roles (like sysadmin) require pretty significant interaction with users.\n\n\n\nTLDR;\nYou don\u2019t get one. Go read it.",

            "Whenever IT is mentioned it's always one of these three fields:\n\n- Help/Service Desk\n\n- Service Tech/Field services\n\n- Networking\n\n- Cyber \n\nJust a friendly reminder to all that usually IT is accompanied by...**IS**. There's a lot of Information Systems positions that you may be very qualified for and don't know because you either you ignored that entire side of the field or are too scared of the more \"clerical\" work. From being a business analyst, QA tester, Asset/license manager.....a lot of jobs that are waiting for that person who has 10 years of office experience and can follow directions or whatnot. \n\nDon't short-change yourself....or wake up. Or maybe don't wake up and keep banging your head in your help desk job and not asking your company how you cna make that pivot to being a BA, as trust me, most just rely on Visio + Excel and those are things you too cna learn :)",
            "To add to this, if you're looking to get into IT and are serious about it, at the very least you should look into getting an Associates Degree in an IT major.\n\nExperience is definitely far more important, but nowadays a degree is almost always required, even for entry level jobs. There's so many people looking for IT jobs that it seems most HR departments have that as a hard requirement, so even people that have experience get filtered out for simply not having one. I'd say a degree is far more important than certifications, for the HR filter aspect alone.\n\nTo put it into perspective, I've had coworkers that have been working in IT longer than I've been alive, that have been stuck at the same entry level positions I was working simply because they didn't have a degree so they weren't technically qualified for anything better. I had the same job they had, and they had far more experience than I did, but I was the one that ended up getting promoted into a cybersecurity position over them because I had that piece of paper they lacked.",

            "I would add BE OS AGNOSTIC to give yourself an edge over all the others who will only use one OS. Learn Linux, Windows, and Mac OS like the back of your hand and it will help you get in easier. It will also help you hold onto your job when the rest of the team refuses to support or touch the new computer your VP just bough themselves and you can step in and assist them. I have literally had that happen multiple times.\n\nCybersecurity is boring as all hell, it isn't hacking or at least it rarely is. It is writing policies and having meetings and telling petulant child like adults that yes they do have to use MFA and no they can't bypass security measures and yes you know it is inconvenient but they need to get over it.\n\nLastly work on your interview skills and your resume. The industry is saturated but so often when I dig deeper the people having issues getting a job are having trouble with their interviews and only make it to one interview before being tossed aside. You can have all the skills in the world but if you suck at interviews and your resume sucks you will get nowhere.\n\nAlso work on your people skills you need to get along and work well in a team setting. IT people who are assholes and can't work on a team don't last long or if they do it is very rare.\n\nThis post is great by the way. \n\nAlso if you get into IT and are in a generalist role and you want to specialize in networking for instance then do everything you can to shadow the network guy and ask questions and ask them if you can take care of smaller network issues or at least try to fix them before escalating to them. That is how I learned networking and firewalls. I started working on those tickets instead of escalating them and when I got stuck instead of having the network guy fix it for me I asked him questions and for guidance.",

            "I'm surprised by how often CS degrees are mentioned, I don't really see it as IT but maybe this is location dependent.   \n \nCS when I was in it was mostly programming and theory, and I haven't really used anything I learned there in my IT jobs, nor did it teach anything related to helpdesk, sysadmin or security roles which I would consider the backbone of IT. We didn't have classes regarding any Microsoft products or firewalls or anything like that. It was more app creation. At least this was the case when I was in school.   \n\nI can see how it would be helpful in a DevOps role but not much else that I think of when I think IT.  \nIf you want to be a programmer get a CS or Computer Engineering degree, but for IT it seems like an actual IT degree is much more helpful.     \n\nIf I were hiring for an IT role at my company an IT degree > CS degree. \nMaybe CS is different in the U.S though, I'm in Canada.   \n\nThis is what the CS degree looks like.

DO PROJECTS AND ADD THEM TO YOUR RESUME, THESE GREATLY HELP, after you have your foot set in and have a solid foothold of 1-3+ years then your work and experience can slowly start speaking for itself, but stuff like cybersecurity is also very late and not entry level, I\u2019m not shunning anyone pursuing it, but remember IT is a marathon not a sprint, it pays off the longer you\u2019re invested, at least that\u2019s what I\u2019ve seen, and don\u2019t hesitate to ask question, be a go getter, personally with my experience my bosses have loved when I asked a question I didn\u2019t know before I started potentially breaking stuff, a good boss won\u2019t have an issue with you trying to do your job correctly",
            "I learned computers back when they had monolithic core memories so I am not by any means tech savvy in 2024, but as I rose in management I wound up hiring a lot of IT people and managing multi-million IT projects.  The best IT people I have worked with are those that knew how to get their hands dirty.  If you have never picked up a soldering iron, never terminated a cable, never spent any time troubleshooting hardware, then you really don't understand how a computer works.\n\nThe world is full of non-functioning computers that people will give you or will sell you for $10.  Get a bunch and learn to fix them.  Build your own network in your basement.  Learn what does and does not work.  That won't get you a first job in IT, but it will make you a better employee when it happens.  Ultimately most IT comes down to self-learning, so grab a box and get to it.",

            "Best bet? IT sales. The key here is NOT understanding to a granular (i.e. source code) level of the solution. It is being able to articulate the business/user benefit of your offering(s). Especially if selling enterprise software, database, data management, SaaS, etc. So, is $100k (and the WFH aspect) attainable? Umm, yeah, all that means is you're still learning the ropes. Most of the established, legit players offer top tier candidates a 50/50 comp plan, which means 50% is base salary and the other 50% is commissions based on achieving your sales target. A couple of things to consider. Most top-tier candidates enjoy a $150,000 base salary with an overall compensation target of $300,000. Anything you sell after that has a multiplier which really bumps up your earnings. However the real key and the way that you know you are kicking it is that you never look for a job, as your achievements become known. They recruit you. I told one of the top three software companies (MSFT/Google /Oracle) recruiters that no, I wasn't interested three times until I finally agreed to an interview. Had my own personal grand slam with them 18 months later (7 figure earnings that year). I always took the mile-wide, inch-deep approach to knowledge because I always had enough backup internally to help deal with more complex issues. Assumptions are that you have excellent communication skills, understand how to leverage technology into quantifiable business benefits, and a \"take no prisoners\" approach regarding your competitors.",

            ">the wiki is the best place to go\n\nUhm, not necessarily *best*, but pretty darn good, and highly relevant for the context (notably being right here on Reddit)\n\n>2. Roles this great do obviously exist, but they are NOT entry level roles. They are going to be senior level roles where the people filling them have 7-10+ years of IT experience already.\n\nUhm, barrier for entry isn't *quite* that high.  E.g. fresh grad with highly relevant degree and from one of the top universities and towards (e.g. upper 1/3 or (much) better) of class at B.S level, or about top half and up at graduate level ... those relatively few folks may well start off at >=100K - but keep in mind, that schooling is effectively 4+ years of pretty solid often rather to highly relevant experience - and may also include internships, etc.  But that's way above the level of probably >99% of the folks here that are wanting to get into IT or land that first IT job.  Heck, in *some* ways even still above my level and I've been in IT 40+ years and have a pretty solid college background too.  So yeah, the vast majority won't be jumping straight into 100K+ ... and many will never get there either.  It's not about years - though that can quite help.  Some don't rise to the challenge.  Some will be in IT 5+ years and not know a dang thing beyond they day they started - which wasn't much at that and quite minimal.  Others, only 3+ years and they'll be flying past those with 7+ years like they were standing still (but that's exceedingly rare exception - like probably less than one in a thousand - but they do exist, and I've seen a few).\n\n>Experience > Certificates or Degree\n\n>Experience\n\nRelevant knowledge and dang well knowing how to apply it is highly important.  Some/much of the time trumps experience ... but not necessarily so - that will vary a lot among employers and hiring managers, etc. - heck, even the HR, etc. gauntlet of filters one may have to first make it through.  And of course experience is also quite important and highly relevant.  And experience needn't be limited to *work* experience.  If you've done it, that counts - and can, e.g well put it on resume as experience/skill, etc.  But do be dang ready to well explain that experience or whatever if/when they ask about it if it's not from work experience.  Random example - I've been doing lots more with IPv6 and DNSSEC for decades on my own for many public servers/services, compared to the relative pittance of such most employers have thus far had me do with such - and I can highly well cover such topics and manage them, etc. (not how I'd word it to prospective employer, but hopefully you get the point).\n\n>If you cannot get that job then start home labbing\n\nDon't forget volunteering.  Do/solve stuff for other folks (but not their homework problems), participate in relevant forums, figure out the answers/solutions to solve stuff or implement the needed.  Often lots more interesting/challenging stuff from \"real world\" scenarios than anything you might think to slap together in your \"home lab\".\n\n>If you get a degree, your best bet is almost always going to be getting a generic IT or CS\n\nDoes depend a whole lot upon the institution and degree program.  Some specialization/focus *can* be a good thing.  But don't box yourself in *too* much ... especially if you actually want to get a paid job in some reasonable amount of time.  Some degree programs also allow for much flexibility, all under/within the exact same degree - e.g. picking a specialization or emphasis ... or even picking and choosing specific classes as one wishes - so long as they satisfy the requirements of the degree - so carefully evaluate and choose wisely.  Anyway, too broad *or* too focused/specialized can be (quite) sub-optimal.  E.g. B.S. in General Studies will generally be sub-optimal.  Likewise a B.S. with extreme specialization on something where there are 3 jobs on the planet in that specialization, and 100,000 well qualified folks that want one of those 3 jobs.  Optimal will be the right balance between those extremes.\n\n>cybersecurity\n\nOft said, but to reemphasize, oversaturated, especially lower/entry levels - not impossible, but much more challenging to land jobs there.  Most opportunities open up at solid relevant graduate+ level degrees.\n\n>as far as certificates go\n\nAs I oft (approximately) say: Certs schmerts!  ;-)  Knowledge, etc., generally much more important.  And also, some certs are helluva lot more useful/practical/worthwhile/valuable than others (some are a ripoff and (near) total waste).  That being said, certs can be useful where resume/experience etc. doesn't otherwise show the knowledge/skills and one doesn't have the experience, etc., and/or for some (especially lower/entry) positions where many openings for many employers may use or require certain cert(s) as a gatekeeping filter.  So certs *can* be a useful way, but certainly not the *only* way.  And for some/many, if you find certs are an excellent way you well learn the stuff - hey, sure, go for it!  But for some folks and/or certs, they may not be more than short-term memory exercises.\n\n>going to agree on Experience > Degree or Certificate, rather than Experience > Certificate > Degree\n\nContext matters - a *lot*.  Degree \"vs.\" experience - often depends a whole lot on the employer, but the majority of time it's the knowledge and experience that matter most, and degree behind that - but for some, degree or even certain type of degree may be a requirement.  As far as degree(s) vs. cert(s), rule of thumb - degrees are for the longer term and will generally serve one quite to highly well in that regard.  Certs are mostly for the shorter term and are mostly more advantageous more towards lower/entry levels.  But there are also various exceptions to these generalities.",

I have been trying to get into our IT audit branch and I was able to do that in 2023. I am still green and learning a lot but now I am an IT auditor for 7 months and work on federal compliance single audits 5 months of the year (hate it!). It\u2019s a great job. I work 4 days a week and fully remote besides 1 day a month. I live in the middle of no where Eastern Kentucky where cost of living is amazing. Like extremely LCOL. My issue is I am at the top of my salary at 92k. I am an Auditor 6 which is the highest rank we have besides manager. So, the only growth I will get is if we get raises across the board in state government, which happens occasionally. No pension btw, it\u2019s a hybrid cash plan and seems to grow extremely slow with my employer matching my 4%. Also this is a merit position, ,so I cannot be fired. I love the job for the work life balance, hours, ability to live anywhere in the state of Kentucky, and I get some IT audit in the mix. I don't like the job because I am the top without growth and I still have to do Financial audits.\n\nI have been offered a job working in NERC CIP. This seems like a huge step up for me as far regarding industry and cybersecurity. I am starting out at 96k, with my employer giving 10.5% to my 4.5% in retirement. \u00a0This position caps out at 145k, doesn\u2019t mean I will get there but it shows room for growth. They will pay for my masters degree and any certifications as well of which I plan to do if I take this position. So, this job is all about career growth and pivoting out of accounting into full cybersecurity and a better industry (energy). The job is about 1 \u00bd hours from where I currently live and the cost of living there is almost double. The job is hybrid with 3 days in office and 2 remote. I do worry I am flying to close to the sun and not prepared for what this job brings, but in the interview I was very honest about having low technical skills and is more of a compliance/audit person than IT/cybersecurity. I want this job because the growth and could pivot my career out of audit/accounting into cybersecurity, but the grass is not always greener. Also this area is MCOL, the home prices are about 100-150k more vs where I currently live. \n\nAny thoughts or more context if needed I can help with. I am stuck at a crossroads with this one.

For future reference, could you share your own entry point into IT and suggest alternative paths I can explore with a Bachelor\u2019s in IT and the certifications I\u2019m working towards, aside from the help desk?\n\nThank you!\n\n",

It can be something like Apple, M365, or similar and then familiarize yourself with that and if you want obtain a certification in it to set yourself apart from other applicants. Your primary target right now should be Help Desk or Desktop support as that's what you're qualified for, and will be the easiest to obtain. You may also want to ask at the school you work at, if there is a way to shadow or learn about any upcoming district technology openings as a way to use the affinity from teaching to move into another role. To be direct; the entry level market is oversaturated right now, and many are finding it incredibly difficult to find jobs.",

        "content": "I need some advice about finding a new job/career, I'm older (nearing 50) and have been out of the work force for 8 years. Thank you in advance for considering, I'll try to keep this short:\n\nI have an electrical engineering degree (BSEE). I worked as engineer mainly in manufacturing of medical devices and scientific instruments in a major metro tech area for 15 years.\u00a0 My partner and I decided to move to a smaller city, with no real good industry for me, and I became the stay-at-home dad to homeschool our children for \u201ca couple years\u201d, that somehow turned into 8 years no real outside job.\u00a0 I recently got an MBA from an in-person university. \u00a0I\u2019ve not worked in any capacity as an MBA, so basically, I took it \u201cfor fun\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m in a bad area for my particular EE subset, and I\u2019m afraid my MBA at my age with no business admin background, is not helpful to get an engineering job, or really even an mba job. I just need to get back in the door. \u00a0My goal is to have a career where I can eventually work remotely.    \n  \nUnfortunately my specific manufacturing background does not lend well to remote work.  I\u2019m a decent programmer, proficient in C/C++ device drivers etc., and learning Python currently. I have a good background in internet stuff, security basics, etc., but obviously as an EE more self-taught in programming, and not a computer science or IT person.\n\nOur local community college has an associate\u2019s degree in IT related areas that is very affordable and easy to get into.\u00a0 This clearly is entry level oriented, but it might be valuable for industry connections and doors that would open.  \n  \nTLDR: as an older BSEE with a dangling MBA, who\u2019s been out of work for 8 years (good lord), would going to a 2-year associates level IT type of degree be a dumb idea?\u00a0 A waste of money?\u00a0 Is there a better option?  \n  \n",

Remote roles are highly unlikely for the time being.\n\nSome things to consider:\n\n* Entry-level technology roles across the board are highly saturated, especially when discussing remote roles. Be prepared for an extensive time period of applying to roles, and consider looking for in-office or hybrid roles as a starting point.\n\n* If you do intend on getting into a hands-on tech role, your background favors development more than IT operations. If this is what you wish to go into, you might want to check /r/cscareerquestions and/or begin working on a development portfolio.\n\n* If you insist on sticking to an IT operations pathway, read the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/wiki/index) before you do anything else (especially before you invest in an AS course).\n\n* You have an MBA and a fairly extensive background in manufacturing.

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nTLDR: I enjoy coding; previous job moved away to everything except coding; quit my job; now I have no clue what to look for since I am really afraid of a boring job.\n\nI'm in my early 30s, based in Switzerland, and I have a Master's in CS. I've worked at a European company for 8-9 years (200 employees in CH), where I was the only in-house developer (but few other devs in eastern Europe). \n\nEarlier this year I had the gut feeling that I need to change something and step out of my comfort zone and thus quit my job.\n\nFor the company I developed a comprehensive software system (UI, Backend, DB, distributed web services) that has become essential for the company's operations and is now being rolled out for other countries as well since for CH it was a huge success.\n\n**Why I Left My Job:**\n\n1. **Overwhelming Responsibilities:** The software's growth meant I was handling analysis, integrations, 1st-3rd level support, rollout planning, devops, testing, and internal development planning almost entirely on my own (since 2 years I had another good developer from eastern Europe, but - altough test coverage was quite high - always had to check every single change since the complexity of the software was enormous and he was not that clear about out business logic).\n2. **Passion for Coding:** I love deep, complex development work and the hyper focus, but now that we went live with the software, in the last 2-3 years my role shifted towards management and support, which I didn't enjoy (in the past few months maybe 20% of my time was coding). In the first 5-6 years it was mostly coding since it was more like a proof of concept kind of thing with some quite challenging algorithms.\n3. **Additional Tasks:** Besides the main software, I developed and supported other smaller tools, acted as a product owner & tester for several other tools, and handled data extracts for f.e. AI projects. I also managed devops and DBA tasks for other tools.\n\n\n\nAfter resigning, my manager suggested I take on an analyst/PM role, leveraging my strength in understanding the business and thinking ahead.  However, I prefer coding and tackling complex development challenges.\n\n\n\nSo now that I am now traveling for 2-3 months already, I am starting to become ready for the next challenge, but I have trouble on finding out what it could be**.** What I'm looking for is:\n\n* I want to stay in IT and continue coding, focusing on complex and challenging projects (at first I considered to completely leave IT and start from scratch, but I know that would not end well)\n* I'm concerned that a typical coding job might be too routine and not challenging enough, so probably I should look for a smaller company and not for some bigger company (tbh to some extend I liked the chaos of my previous job)\n* Self-employment is an option, but it might involve handling support and devops independently (my old employer could provide projects).\n* Returning to my previous employer either as a developer (but I risk ending up in the same situation) or alternatively, I could focus on business analysis, but that wouldn\u2019t satisfy my passion for coding (and also really looking into a new challenge and leaving the comfort zone) - only reason that speaks for this is the comprehensive knowledge I have about everything in this company.\n* I\u2019m considering a shift to AI, though my experience is limited (altough my master thesis was related and I was the PO of some AI projects). Also ETH Zurich offers courses that could help me get started. I have a feeling that this could be interesting and challenging, but not sure if I see myself there.\n* Another option is pursuing a PhD, but I worry it might become monotonous to focus on a single topic for that long (but I think CH offers some quite nice positions).\n\nAny advice on potential career paths or opportunities that align with my interests and skills would be greatly appreciated! Recommendations for literature or podcasts are also welcome.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!  \n\n\nNB: formatted and summarized it a bit with ChatGPT",

Some of the printer manufacturers were way too fucking resistant to sending whole unit replacements and would just keep sending us back out to swap more parts and I can't imagine that was actually saving money to send us out 4 days in a row swapping like 10 different parts.  I remember one particularly troublesome printer that a coworker and I kept taking turns on . . . after a whole week of bs, he calls me and says \"NetworkingJesus, you're not gonna believe this . . . I turned around for a minute to grab something and *someone* knocked the whole damn thing off the counter.  Completely shattered.  Guess they'll just have to send a replacement.\"  I am 100% positive he was the \"*someone*\" and I don't blame him one bit.  And that guy actually *liked* doing printer and POS tickets.  Big part of the reason I quit was him getting fired over some unrelated BS, not displaying his badge at a financial customer I think.  I liked the financial customers because it was usually not printer tickets for them, or just rollers or something simple if it was (banks are kept muuuuch cleaner than a fucking home depot or target or whatever).  We'd usually trade tickets because we liked opposite stuff.  When they fired him, my life got significantly worse.\n\nAnyways, when I quit, boss said he saw it coming, could tell I was burning out.

On a regular basis, students would scan subnets for printers, find all of ours, and send over a 50,000 page print job where the sole purpose was to just waste all the paper. You'd come in in the morning and trays would be empty with \"PC LOAD LETTER\" flashing on the LCD.  THe IT Manager, she had this great idea, to put all of the printers on programmable power bars. So , lets say at 5 pm, the powerbar just yanks juice and the printer turns off. Nevermind this caused problems on the weekends for people who legit needed to print something , according to a couple printer techs was really not a wise practice long term.

I was able to carve out a role for myself as the admin responsible for sec was completely fucking over dealing with on prem outlook and barracuda and was eager to dump it on someone which let me specialize a little bit, but that was on top of being a servicedesk escalation point and responsible for drafting documentation for the Service desk 1 and 2 staff to use. \n\nAfter a couple years, an SD3 role was created that was placed \"above\" my role and it was made clear there are no lateral moves to sysadmin work so I put in my notice immediately. \n\nThe moral of this ramble is just make sure the path you want to walk exists beyond just hope.",

        "title": "Demoted from sysadmin to helpdesk due to health problems/burnout, and just had a job offer rescinded due to poor references. Should I just change careers at this point?",
        "content": "What should I do in a situation where, due to an unfortunate combination of events, I have no references but 10 years of work experience?\n\nI\u2019ve only worked at two places. I worked at Job #1 from 2012 to 2018 where I progressed from desktop support to Jr Sysadmin, and was a sysadmin at Job #2 from 2018 to June of this year. I got along well with Frank, one of the higher ups at Job #1. When I applied for my most recent job (Job #2), I used Frank as a reference, and a couple of coworkers, since 3 references in total were required.\n\nAccording to my new supervisor at Job #2, Frank gave such a strong reference that he didn\u2019t even bother calling the others on my list.\n\nAt Job #2, things were fine for the first couple of years. But in 2021, I underwent a complicated series of medical procedures, and I needed to use all of my allotted FMLA and most of my PTO. On top of that, my mother was diagnosed with dementia, and I was working on my bachelors in business during evenings and weekends. I had a grant to attend college tuition-free, but I had to have continuous enrollment to qualify. I checked with administration to see if I could take medical leave, but they told me if I did I would have to start paying. \n\nThis led to me burning out and receiving a poor performance review and a demotion (with the same pay and title) due to decreased work ethic and lack of attendance. For context, from 2021 to 2022, I had 4 inpatient surgeries, 2 ER trips, and dozens of physical therapy appointments and post op appointments in a 12 month period.\n\nHowever, the supervisor for Job #2 initiated an offer to give me a good reference if I decided to move on to another employer due to the demotion. \n\nLast week, I was offered a new job contingent on a reference check. One of the references was required to be a supervisor from the past 5 years, meaning I was forced to use the Job #2 supervisor as a reference. I messaged my supervisor asking if he would give a reference, to which he said he would be \u201chappy to give a good reference, although HR would prefer I only confirm your title and the start date of your employment.\u201d \n\nI next tried to get in touch with Frank, the really good reference from Job #1, via phone and email to ask his permission to use him as a reference again. No response to either request. With Frank out of the picture, and also unable to establish contact with a couple of other potential references from Job #1, I was forced to use a coworker from Job #2. He also reassured me he would give a good reference.\n\nLast week, I found out the offer for the new job was rescinded since my references said that I had a poor work ethic and attendance record. As stated earlier, I had major medical problems in 2021-22, making it difficult for me to give my all at work while dealing with severe complications requiring emergency care, scheduling follow up surgeries, and all of the associated stress of being a medical patient with unresolved physical problems for an indefinite period of time. And both of these individuals told me they would give good references, with my supervisor initiating the offer to start with.\n\nAt this point I feel like I need to go into another career field entirely because I have no references who will speak positively about my work. And in 10 years of working, I have only had one poor performance review, the most recent one, due to me being out on medical leave.\n\nWhat do I do next?",

I don't really have a \"network\" of people I can just call up and instantly get a job from like most people seem to have, so I assume it's going to be a forced early retirement at some point. In the US that's pretty scary honestly, because let's say you get fired when you're 55. Social security's minimum payout (with permanent benefit reduction) starts when you're 62, government-provided health insurance starts at 65, and you're supposed to retire at 67.

Only thing I can do is dump as much as I can into retirement accounts, maybe try to find a government or similar job that doesn't age-discriminate as much to minimize my firing chances, I don't know.\n\nHonestly it's very concerning.

            "Long answer: I continue to get paid well because all the new IT guys only know how to be point-and-click Windows admins.  I picked up a new client about a year ago.  One month in, I identified a point-and-click IT guy they were using to gather business analytics.  It was using Microsoft SQL Server (expensive) with SQL Reporting Services.  The hardware was insane--several TB of SSD storage, 256 GB RAM, and dual 8-core 3.2 GHz CPUs.  And the IT Bro who ran it cost them \\~$15k/mo.  There was a compiled .NET App that would launch via Scheduled Tasks--one per office the client owned...and then it would hammer the remote Sybase database at each office while basically making a copy of it into MSSQL while translating a few table names and field names along the way.  Every night at 8 PM their corporate office would basically lose internet access while a few hundreds gigs of data was downloaded.  At 7 AM it was usually done (but not always) and a new scheduled task would start (another horrid .NET app) that would \"compute\" the data and make it available through IIS so they could view the analytics as a dashboard.  If an office didn't complete in time or timed out during the night you'd have partial data or no data.  In the case of partial data you'd \"just have to know\" that something was off and the IT Bro would connect in and re-run the \"compute\" task...or the re-download-that-one-office task effectively taking out their internet again for an hour.\n\nI wrote a nice little NodeJS app over the course of a few days, put it into a docker container, and just launched it at each office.  The NodeJS app would pull \\*only\\* the necessary data out of the Sybase database, crunch it, and post the results up to a $30/mo VPS running an API backed by Postgres (free) and a dashboard written in Django (also free).  I showed them the solution and showed how it updated constantly throughout the day, and told them that if they switched they would stop having problems with internet at their corporate office.  And they could re-purpose that monster SQL server into something else.\n\nThe poor IT Bro was busy looking for a \"database throttling\" .NET library to try to fix the problem when they axed him.  I don't feel bad.  They had been paying him a handsome $15k/mo for almost 18 months and he sat on his thumbs.  In turn I got $5k/mo for my solution.  It expanded a few months ago  to handle other clients too.  I dropped the price even further.  The old client is happy.  The new clients are happy.  I'm making a decent living, and spending \\~$100/mo on a Kubernetes cluster running on a few Linux boxes.\n\nDuring the same time, I managed to cut that client's monthly VoIP spend from $13k/mo (for 12 offices) down to $600/mo for 24 offices.  Didn't even charge for that.  But that's what happens when you hire someone who only knows how to basically be a \"reseller\" for things they don't know...and point-and-click admins don't know much.\n\nMy main business (being an MSP) averages 20 calls per day with a total resolution average of 90 seconds.  We don't pay for ConnectWise, TeamViewer, or any other nonsense.  We have our own remote support tool, our own ticketing system, etc...  We manage about 8,000 Windows, Linux, and BSD machines across our client base.\n\nTotal business expenses: \\~$2,000. Most of that is for AV and a Kubernetes cluster for running our applications (tickets, chat, automation system, phone/voice traffic, etc...).\n\nShort answer:  Be competent, work hard, hire smart, refuse to pay someone else to do what you should be capable of doing internally, hate Microsoft with a passion, avoid closed-source software.",

Over time I evolved from being a pure SysAdmin _(and 1st to 3rd level support, that's how it is in small companies)_ into a programmer.\n\nI started off writing programs on my own to help with our sysadmin tasks. One day someone approached me and asked if I could perhaps also write a \"real\" program _(=something with an UI that other users than us IT guys would then use)_. The task was simple enough so that I agreed to give it a try and fulfilled the job. It turned out to be an incredible time safer for that department. Eventually the word spread through the company that there's an inhouse resource that's capable of programming, so requests came in more frequently until I basically became a full-time programmer.\n\nI was fortunate enough of being able to decline requests, as I was honest enough to state that I'm not (yet) qualified enough for the task at hand or that it would take me literally _years_ to do that alone.\n\nNowadays I'm a full-time programmer (by job definition) in a different company.

It helps that i now have a team that has my back instead of being the only person being able to do stuff.\n\nMy current employer found that my experience as a sysadmin comes in handy, knowing about the systems, networking and general 'how shit works' helps to find bugs in the code and helps when diagnosing issues.  \nMy advice for jumping into a developer role is get a few personal projects, something that interests you, and get some code up on Github. Show that you know good coding practices and DevOps. DevOps is a nice crossover from sysadmin to developer and it helps to know it in either role.\n\nOverall, do what you enjoy.

            "As a 30 year IT vet, Here\u2019s my 27 cents\u2026  It depends a little on the environment you intend to work in.  Assuming corporate, I\u2019d rank the jobs in terms of availability, security, and pay by the following types:  1. Information Security, 2. DevOps, 3. Developer, 4. System Engineer.  I would literally reverse this in terms of enjoyment though personally.  Though one spin I\u2019d place on the admin/engineer role would be if you are a network engineer (a real one), or any system engineer with lots of cloud experience.  Azure and AWS are a completely new kind of admin/engineering.  Both in assets as well as networking, licensing, etc.  I am a VP in the corporate world now, and I\u2019ve been trying to hire a good Network Engineer with Azure experience, for about 4 months, and so far I haven\u2019t found one, unless they are shooting for the moon and wanting a huge salary and full remote work.  I am flexible, but apparently not flexible enough\u2026\n\nInformation Security jobs are everywhere, and they pay really well.  I had one InfoSec guy making around $60k per year with only about 2 years experience, leave us for a job making $90K.  I have system admins/engineers making that much with 10+ years experience, and the job is a lot more demanding than the InfoSec job.  But it\u2019s also way more boring in InfoSec.\n\nDevOps jobs pay very well, but there are the least of them.  Our company for example, has about 10 in IT Services, 6 in Information Security, 30 in Development, and 3 in DevOps.\n\nNow if you\u2019re talking MSP or small-medium business consulting, being an admin/engineer is the most engaging and rewarding.  You meet a lot of people, constantly get new challenges and different environments to design/build/support, but it probably pays the least unless you own the business.",

C++ and c# used to be my jam, dunno if those are even used anymore because I\u2019m too worried about the next exchange or log4j vulnerability. \n\nI\u2019ve had a similar desire to make the jump and here is my plan that I borrowed from an old coworker who successfully did this. Spend a year teaching yourself as much as possible, make some games, applications, whatever. Just spend your off hours getting back in the developer mindset and practicing. Publish the good ones. Then he went and got a few certs. Sure it costed a few bucks but those bucks \u201cprove\u201d you know something which is an unfortunate necessity some places and might be the only way to get in the door.

            "I taught for 10 years before going into IT at 34.  It's definitely doable.  \n\nAdmittedly your progression will be partially based on what you did before.  Personally, I taught STEM, including engineering and computer science, and I did L1 Helpdesk when I was in college.  This made transitioning back into IT much easier, and I'm currently a tech support lead for a portion of a K-12 school district.  I've been doing this for two years and am at the point where I'm ready for / seeking my first system administration position.  I already do some Jr. System Administrator work in my day to day duties.\n\nI had a master's as well, but if I were to do it again, I'm not sure I'd put it on my resume.  When going into support roles, it very nearly aced me out for being 'overqualified.'  Now that I'm looking for SA positions, I would put it back on my resume.\n\nIn the intermediary time, I've earned multiple certifications to help my pathway, including CompTIA Security+, CCNA, and RHCSA.  This was the palatable alternative to getting another degree.  I chose Security+ and CCNA because from my research and limited understanding, every successful system administrator needs a fundamental understanding of networking and cybersecurity, something both of these certs granted.  The RHCSA is because I desire to focus on Linux/Cloud administration in the longer term.  If you want to focus on Windows environments, look at Microsoft certs, particularly in the Azure space, and if they ever develop them, Intune.\n\nIT is in a weird place right now where the lower levels are glutted with employees. Employers picked up a lot of staff during COVID to lift up services, and cut all them loose in the last year.  There's a lot of people competing for lower level positions.  In our last L1 support hiring, we had over 50 qualified applicants, however, part of it is also that we pay well.  The high level positions are dying for talent, but you need experience to get there.  As a result of this competition, more IT employers than ever are asking for degrees, which is going to help you out.  That being said, IT generally has never been a field that relies on degrees (unless you're in leadership), preferring experience first, certifications second, school third.  The current excess of low-level IT professionals is going to make getting your first role tough, but not insurmountable.\n\nInstructional design is pretty nifty, but beware that due to the glut of educators leaving the field to go into this, it is a pretty stagnant field for salary, and there is little to no career growth potential.  This is because the job isn't technical enough to advance in IT (unless becoming a manager of instructional designers).\n\nCybersecurity is 'hot' right now, but it is not an entry-level job.  You need to cut your teeth in network administration or system administration for a while first, unless you go from technical support into being a cybersecurity analyst.  A lot of people struggle with being an analyst as it is the least 'sexy' part of the job.  It is lots of data and logging.  If you enjoy that, however, it will pave your way to being a cybersecurity professional.\n\nIf you like being intellectually challenged, then I sincerely believe IT is a great career for you.  Don't get disheartened if technical support isn't as challenging as you hope it to be.  Use it as an opportunity to learn systems, make connections, and use your downtime to learn System Administration and or partner with those teams to learn.\n\nMost of all, your greatest asset and what has helped me grow in IT quickly is your soft skills from education.  Verbal and written communication abilities, professional abilities, and other things will be 'second-nature' to you that other professionals sincerely struggle with.  Highlight these abilities, especially when starting in technical support, your ability to work with people, meet them where they are.  IT is a surprisingly interpersonal job, especially at the lower levels.  It isn't until you start becoming a subject matter expert (SME) and getting into Tier 3 support and above that you start separating from users.  Even then, you'll be working with vendors and other IT professionals all the time, and those soft skills come in clutch.\n\nGood luck, you got this!",

Things like:\n\n* Users using the Excel desktop apps losing changes to their workbooks\n* OneDrive Sync client randomly recreating folders after they are deleted or moved causing a mess\n* People not being able to save changes to files in Word/Excel\n* Folders created using Sync client can't be deleted off the user's computer because of a reparse point error. Only way to fix it is running scan disk on the user's computer\n* OneDrive sync client randomly stops working without any indication it's not working. So it won't save any of your changes back to cloud unless you restart it, but the OneDrive icon is there in the taskbar and indicates everything is fine\n* Extremely slow sync times with the sync client, 1 hour+ for a file to be saved to SharePoint/OneDrive\n\nI've been going back and forth with their support on these issues for close to a year and have gotten nowhere. Today I was finally told they won't escalate my tickets or offer me any more support because they say our file paths in SharePoint are too long. This is what a basic file path looks like in our environment (this is in the default document library that comes with team sites):\n\nYEAR - Customer - Project\\\\Drawings\\\\electrical drawing 01.pdf\n\nThis is because support told me sharepoint online has a path limit of 260 characters and after the path is URL encoded, and a bunch of parameters are added to the URL, a path with as little as 60 characters will be too long for Sharepoint to support. This then gives their support an excuse to refuse to work on ANY issues we have with SharePoint online.\n\nIf you're seriously considering SharePoint Online to store your files do yourself a major favor and don't. I've aged 10 years in the 2 years we've been using SharePoint Online, and it will be expensive moving away from it at this point (but much cheaper than the medical costs myself and our employees will incur from the stress Sharepoint causes).",

Everyone here is talking about SharePoint, but OneDrive has the same limitation and (as far as I know) OneDrive IS meant to replace file and folder structure... so the same doesn't really apply?  I realize that these two products basically work the same way but that's kinda the point right?  Microsoft is literally right now in present time releasing methods for OneDrive folder redirection and implementation, known folder move, etc., so it seems pretty clear that it's meant to replace local storage at least in part.\n\nAnd I have the same issues with OneDrive - the biggest gripe being lost data.  It doesn't happen often, but there seems to be no rhyme or reason to it.  I have had it happen to myself twice personally where entire files were lost, other times just partial.  I created the file, saved it, and started editing which would include periodic saving.  I would save the file when I was done, close it down, and when I'd re-open it again 30 minutes later, half of the changes would be lost.  In one case, the entire file was blank.  I created it, printed it, saved it, closed it.  Realized that I accidentally printed double-sided when I needed single-sided, re-opened it to print it correctly and it was completely blank.  In that case at least I had the printout, but in other cases I had nothing and the file was just gone.  I searched endlessly in temp folders, OneDrive recycle bin, EVERYWHERE and found nothing.  One of the documents I lost was the notes I was taking down while creating a new golden image and I was soooo pissed when I lost it as I had been taking meticulous notes.\n\nThe fact that I can't replicate it makes it that much more frustrating because I can't find ANY info on it nor report it to Microsoft without getting useless replies.  We have only moved a few people onto it so far but it is making them untrusting of it and making me more reluctant to move more because I do not trust it myself.  And I am a technical user.  So if it's frustrating ME, how can I in good faith roll it out to 55 year old employees who are already resistant to change?\n\nETA: I had a user who was trying to name a file with a hyphen in it or something like that, and he was getting an obscure error which made him think he couldn't put hyphens in filenames anymore.  Might have been parenthesis, can't recall, but it was something that \"used to work\" and no longer did after I'd recently moved him to OneDrive.  It ended up being the character limit in OneDrive.

With the sync client recreating locally deleted files. I've found that on the occasion this happens its usually with a folder that has many subfolders beneath. For some reason if I go to SharePoint online and try to delete the parent it says you have to delete all children first. So in those cases I exit the sync client, go to SharePoint online, flush out the folders then relaunch the sync client.\n3. Haven't seen this one\n4. See number 2 but a restart was required first\n5. I used to have this problem all the stinkin' time, the client would say it was updating files but if you looked at its status you'd see it was hung up on a single file and wasn't touching the others. Turns out the software I used to track my time, its database file was the culprit, the software itself locked the file in such a way that the sync client couldn't get it and rather than skip it, just kept trying. Closing and reopening the client would get sync going again and it would somehow also sync the database file. I no longer use that software and I haven't seen that problem since.\n6. I've not had slow syncs as far as I've been able to tell, files usually sync between 3-15 seconds after saving them.\n\nAs for the folder limitations, when we migrated to SharePoint online and I migrated several departments' files to their new home I ran into a few instances where the folder structure was a freaking mess. Several folders deep without any real legitimate reason why. Just removing the redundant folders took care of it. I've yet to have any users run into this limitation as of yet.\n\nNot saying these problems aren't ridiculous, considering Microsoft's size and market share there should be no reason these bugs couldn't be addressed. Just wanted to share our experience, which has been mostly positive, as I know this subreddit can turn into a \"fuck Microsoft\" circlejerk sometimes.

It has grown over the years and can handle large data sets if you do it correctly. Which based off of your complaints and your stated \"observations\", you didn't.  \n\n\nSharePoint stores everything in a SQL Database, so to handle large data sets you have to store it like a database and use metadata. \n\nIn your example you file path is: \n\nYEAR - Customer - Project\\\\Drawings\\\\electrical drawing 01.pdf  \n\n\nWhich from SharePoints perspect each folder plus the drawing file is item that has to be looked up to access your file. In your example there is 3 lookups for one actual file.   \n\n\nIf you used step 1 in microsoft's best practices instead of creating folders you would have created columns.   \n\n\n|  Year  | Customer  |  Project Name  | File category | File Name |  \n\n\nThen if the number of files is largest enough where ad hoc sorting and filter is to combersume then you can create views set on predefined settings like year or customer. This format is a single look up compared to the 3 lookups in your structure.   \n\n\nStep 2 would be to break up your data into multiple document libraries and sites based on a the best organization structure for your company (Logical, Departmentt, or both).   \n\n\nOverall this is your tradeoff. For a 1:1 comparison to host everything Office 365 provides (Redundant File Server or SharePoint, Exchange, Active Directory) in a redundant network deployment you're looking at roughly $200K in hardware and licensing to get started. In this method you can directly migrate your data as is and your are fully responsible for everything.

So far no one has been able to give me clear answer to how you should link files stored on SharePoint/OneDrive for Business. Ms Office doesn't seem to recognize OneDrive for Business so it just uses local paths breaking the links for other people. It's been tough trying to figure out how to stuff like embed an excel spreadsheet in a ppt slide, a typical use case for us, that works for more people because of that.\n\nOur current solution goes back to days of DOS by using SUBST to create virtual drives on top of OneDrive for Business.

The document name example you gave could be as simple as...  electrical drawing 01 with the  YEAR - Customer - Project and Drawings portions all in their metadata fields, allowing you filter the content instead of drilling into a mine shaft of useless folders. \n\nUntil you get your head around that, there is no point even trying to sort out the other issues. \n\nThis is not the product, its user error/lack of user understanding.",

Check with Task Manager to see what .exe you are using and do whatever you need to do to kill groove.exe and make sure no uses it ever again.\n\n400 characters is the path/filename limit for OneDrive and SharePoint. I don't know where you go 60 from. 260 was the limit about 2 or 3 years ago.   A space character in your file name is the equivalent of %20 in a web URL (3 characters).\n\nIf you put a space character at the front or end of a file or folder name, it will not sync.

Well not that new actually.  If your org are still using the old Office 2003 binary .doc .xls .ppt formats it is time to move on! Seriously!

I went to see the place, and suggested to replace these halogen pot lights with LED ones. They agreed. I bought 8 LED under cabinet spots from amazon, i already knew a brand they was reliable for me in the past.

I have I found a new gig??  \n  \nI was already the admin of a Facebook group i created for the community i live in, has 900 members and is active. I made a post in it saying \"Thank you to a member of this group for allowing me to help with the under cabinet lighting project\" And then all of a sudden I am getting requests for handy man work!

            "From what I've seen, there has been a decline in \u201cclassical\u201d sysadmin positions as smaller companies and start-ups moved onto public-cloud-providers. That being said, I am not convinced that this is a trend that will continue endlessly.   \n  \nWhen I've searched for jobs as a Linux System Engineer / Linux System Administrator, I've found that nearly every job offered requires Kubernetes knowledge.  \n\n\nIf you actively want to move on from administrating services for end users and device management, I would recommend looking into technologies such as Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes. If you wish to stay in your lane, that's fine too. Your job won't vanish into thin air.  \n  \nOne last remark regarding the DevOps job offerings: each company has a different idea of what a DevOps engineer is. Some actively work with the development teams, from what I've seen many offerings that require programming skills were in the realm of writing Python scripts to help with automation tasks or using Go to interact with a CDK. Others simply started calling their System administrator jobs DevOps, as it's \u201ctrendy\u201d.",

Companies across all industries and verticals are looking for unicorns like this. 10 year ago, you needed Excel skills (and maybe SQL) if you wanted to work in data analytics. Now they're looking for data engineers using python for predictive modeling and machine learning, while trying to pay them what they were paying Excel jockeys 10 years ago. \n\nSupply Chain analysts are full blown database administrators now. \n\nYou want to work in internal communications under the HR department? Hope you have 15 years of experience in marketing design. \n\nHell, my job is asking for a facilities coordinator (the org who runs reception and maintenance) and they're looking for someone with AutoCAD experience. \n\nIT is not alone here, we've entered an era of unprecedented corporate greed, and it's happening across the board.",
            "I have worked my way up over 12 years from data center intern, sysadmin, to cloud/devops architect for a large global manufacturing company. Then pivoted to an AWS Solutions Architect for two years, now I'm going back to a corporate architect role.\n\n* My time at AWS taught me there is still a TON of people who have no fucking clue about the cloud AND/OR automation. I'd get 45min into a presentation to be hit with \"so this all runs on VMware right?\". I worked mostly with government agencies who are of course behind the times, but their whole team is working classic jobs I held in 2013 (VMware, AD, Dell Servers, no automation), with some modern stuff sprinkled in (mostly M365 and some SaaS security products). While I worked in public sector, I also worked with some privately owned and they're not much different.\n* My time building the cloud environment for a global manufacturing company until 2022 taught me there is a place for everyone at a mid-size or larger enterprise (10k+ employees). We had the following less than 2 years ago...\n   * Developers that focused on building their app (full stack, IaC, as you say)\n   * SREs that just focused on CI/CD and Kubernetes and helping smooth out deployment efforts\n   * My team of cloud engineers building and maintaining our AWS/Azure footprints hosting the above\n   * My team of cloud engineers and sysadmins maintaining our fully automated standard VM deployment process (AWS/Azure/VMware) for those COTS applications\n   * The non-scripting but still passionate infrastructure folks moved on to things like M365\n   * The team of yester-year sysadmins that still maintained our shrinking on-prem VMware footprint and would increasingly relegated to supporting the folks running our COTS applications (kind of a windows/linux admin helpdesk)\n* I would think the above would just be even more prevalent the larger the organization is, until you get to tech companies which are a whole different ballgame. I have no direct insights but I can imagine any of the large banks having all of my example above, plus probably all kinds of even deeper specialists based on non-cloud technologies.\n* I would say to be MARKETABLE, today, in a mid-level or higher role, you need to have some automation experience under your belt, OS knowledge is a foregone assumption, and you need to be jumping at opportunities to get meaningful hands-on experience with AWS or Azure.\n* Most development jobs expect people to understand the full stack now. There's not much \"Just do the front end\". So what you're likely seeing is really just start-up style developers where the organization doesn't have the concept of a \"private network to maintain\" just a bunch of devs building shit and hooking it together. And for that, for now, they don't really need an admin.\n* DevOps jobs wanting development experience makes a lot of sense because you need to know how to support developers, and have the coding chops to build the CI/CD aspects of the environment which are built on automation.",

            "Make no mistake - most software engineers don\u2019t know shit about infrastructure and if left alone they\u2019d run all the servers to the ground. Sysadmin roles are not going away, someone needs to keep all these apps (and their devs) under control.",
            "Is the traditional IT path being eroded and taken over by software engineering?\n\nSorta. Roles and responsibilities are changing as we move more, if not already,  into cloud space.  The days of physical servers are long dead, and on premises stacks like VMware are a dying breed of IT infrastructure.  As far as it is being taken over, I think that's a stretch considering systems administration and software engineering are completely different jobs, and they only share an ancestor of being in the same field of technology.  \n\nHas sysadmin really just become a synonym for a user endpoints and SaaS admin? \n\nNo, at this time, there will always be a need for an administration piece to whatever technology is given.  For example, just because airplanes can fly on autopilot doesn't mean we don't need pilots. I think the same principles will apply with SA's/SE's. For now.... \n\nHow do you transition from this type of sysadmin role to an infrastructure (DevOps?) role? Or is that the wrong growth path?\n\nYou will never stop learning in this field. In my 20 years of experience, the way things were done 20 years ago are completely different then how they were done 10 years ago, and the things done 10 years ago are completely different then how they're done today.  You develop with the trends of technology and never stop learning.  Taking a step into the understanding of system / application development is a great way to step into this next step onto your career field.  If you use PoeerShell or bash you're already not to far from being a Dev-OPs administrator/ engineer.  You then take that next step into understanding more languages and branch off from there and develop an understanding as to how they work with your environment and applications.",
            "Traditionally, Sysadmins were trained in CompSci, and were programmers. It wasn't until Windows Server that things started to change.\n\nI think to be competitive now, you need to understand automation, virtualization, building private clouds, and managing public clouds. AI is also breathing down your neck: within 5 years, many companies will start an AI project to index and organize their information. One more attempt to get data out of silos.",

            "I feel like there are different types of companies.\n\nMany startups outsource IT (or just shadow IT) but they still need \"DevOps\" to productionize client-facing products and internal tools\n\nBut for larger companies the cost to have in-house IT is cheaper and has benefits that outsourcing does not have--as well as moving off-cloud.\n\nThere are just as many differences as there are overlaps between DevOps and traditional Sysadmin roles but many skills are related and interchangeable",
            "> Has sysadmin really just become a synonym for a user endpoints and SaaS admin?\n\nFor most businesses, yes. Where I used to work, now that there's less servers and shit to maintain, they've decided the sysadmins can take on helpdesk tasks which means more end user facing bullshit. I feel like rebuilding a downed exchange cluster is less irritating than dealing with Karen in HR who's abobe acrobat is crashing when opening some 20 year old form that is critical to the business.",
            "I've worked with a bunch of companies in a bunch of different parts of the business lifecycle. The one thing I've found is that developers do not make good administrators. Every developer I've met will look at writing code themselves first to get out of whatever trouble they are in. I've actually had someone start writing a script to automate their way out of a problem instead of checking to see if there is a configuration change that would resolve the issue. As in, there is a toggle in the control panel to make a change, but instead of flipping the toggle, they spend half an hour trying to automate that change with a script.\n\nYou don't need someone with programming skills to administer security and device admin. You don't need a programmer to set up your network.

            "Honestly I've never looked at \"Sys Admin\" as hardware folks.  \"System\" administrators, admin any system they're running... be in telcom, AWS,  VM's,  Physical, network, workstations, etc. etc.  be in purely digital cloud or something you can physically touch.\n\nIT roles in general have indeed most certainly been shifting towards cloud computing for a whole lot of reasons we don't need to get into.  I've worn many hats since I started doing this stuff back in the 90s, and yeah.... people don't think of physical hardware when you say \"SysAdmin\".  In similar roles over different orgs, I started out racking and stacking servers and network infra. In the last 5 years or so I can't remember hte last time I 'touched' a server other than to decommision it after migrating to cloud.\n\nTo most folks Sys Admin means administering mostly established setups and technologies.  \"Infrastructure\" especially tends to be more about working hand in hand with developers to maintain a working and performant production environment, codepushes, infra as code, and devops, etc.\n\nMy advancement path now, and for any other IT people I hire into my teams down the raod, is basically Helpdesk/endpoint management >>> Cloud infrastructure administration >>> management.",
            "It's funny cuz I'm worrying about my future and asking myself if I should look for some other fields, but I'm already in my 30's.\n\nStarted like 2 years ago to get into IT, and got a nice internship as a DevOps, and now I'm a DevOps basically. BUT, at my job, we're not require to do codding.\n\nWe just set-up most of the back-end and lots of CI/CD. I manage a gitlab instance, argocd, a kubernetes cluster where we deploy our stuff, keycloak, vault and such. We're mostly doing YAML files for deployments, set up the projects in gitlab and do the whole CI/CD part.\n\nThen we have to manage some databases and just monitor the logs from time to time for errors, and put out the fires. But that's it. Ohh and sometimes we have some projects to make new instances or stuff work in some cloud.\n\nWhen I'm looking for other job posting, everyone requires codding experience in different languages and dev experience...I'm not that. I'm afraid that if I'm getting out of this job, I'll never be able to find anything else. I just don't know how to code and it never been my interest to do so either.

            "It will always be a hybrid model. And as always, knowing and learning additional/new technologies is helpful. I manage a team hosting apps on-prem and cloud. When the cloud bill comes in ($30k/month for just one app!), there are always asks, if we can not move back to on-prem). When the on-prem discussion starts, there are asks why we are still on prem with that environment.\n\nFrom my perspective, it is just important that the team understands both worlds and they are not biased. They understand the pros and cons and can decide when to use what.\n\nAnother aspect is, btw, that many shops do not offer an own on-prem \u201ecloud\u201c feeling for their end-users/customers. An developer or DevOps guy needs an API to spin up 10 VMs/Pods/whatever instantly.. and not raising an ticket/request a ticket and wait 2 weeks until a SysAdmin set something up.",
            "13 year infrastructure engineer here, started from the help desk and did every role in between. \n\nThe biggest industry change I\u2019ve noticed is the movement away from white glove service. There\u2019s a big push to empower devs to be self sufficient and turn infra resources towards architecture/design/stability/improvement more than customer service. \n\nThe easiest ways I\u2019ve found to transition and learn new skills are to build on existing ones. Shell scripting is a must. You don\u2019t have to know a programming language, but learn how to work in yaml. That\u2019s the basis for a lot of the infra automation tools. I have never met anyone really successful who didn\u2019t do some self-taught skills improvement outside of work that they could use to get ahead. Personally, I took Udemy courses for the things I kept encountering in interviews or at work. Even a basic knowledge can put you ahead of those that don\u2019t try.\n\nWhen you interview, be up front about what you don\u2019t know. Give the concepts and use cases behind them (you can research beforehand if the recruiter tells you specifics or based on the job posting). Then tell them something similar you\u2019ve used to achieve the same goal. Focus on how fast you can learn new skills and that you\u2019re willing to take on whatever challenges arise.",

It's just that we've picked up a lot of the skills and learned a lot of the lessons that the software development side of the wall picked up 10-20 years ago. My team is a team that leverages git, ansible, python, and powershell primarily for managing infrastructure. We obviously have to do things like RDP into a Windows Server and add an AD Site Link from time to time, because we don't do that often enough to justify making that software-defined.

Bigger companies will still have traditional IT because someone will still need to maintain desktops, phones, wifi, printers, DHCP, fileservers, etc. Microsoft is pushing real hard to make Entra (AzureAD) the thing, but more, larger, traditional companies are still too entrenched in on-prem AD (resource wise, or legacy apps) to go fully to the cloud.",

            "Oh man, that one hurts. I was in a very similar situation at a state agency (a medical college). I was there 10 years and my boss spent the previous couple of years before he retired transitioning me into his role. So he retires and on my day one, my new boss tells me that it's an interim appointment but I would have the opportunity to apply for the position once it's posted.\n\nIn that moment, it felt like I got kicked in the chest. I almost couldn't breathe. I'm sure he could tell I wasn't happy with the idea, but I think I mostly kept my composure. Didn't feel like I had any option but to roll with it.\n\nI was running two departments and still doing all the stuff that I was before. We obviously couldn't backfill my old roll with me still in it. I had a real positive impact on the relationship between IT and the rest of the org. Several big wins. But getting my new role posted kept getting pushed until it stopped getting mentioned.\n\nAt the one year mark, I decided to push the issue. I insisted they provide a general timeline. They couldn't even provide that. Their response was \"It's not a priority right now\" and they assured me that I was doing a great job. But that was the moment that I woke up. I was more loyal to the company than the company was to me.\n\nI kept on working like nothing was wrong, but that night I started searching for a new job. I spent the next 6 months searching until I found the right opportunity. While I waited on the background check after accepting the offer, I decided to ask one more time. At 18 months, I again asked for a general timeline, and again, the response was \"it's not a priority\". There was no question that I made the right call.\n\nWhen I resigned, most people thought I was already the Director. I was more than willing to share with anyone that asked about it that it wasn't a priority. By chance, I got to break the news to the Dean (my skip level). He was almost comically non-confrontational, but people could hear him ripping my boss a new one behind closed doors.\n\nThey immediately hired two people to replace me and filled the Director role 4-6 months after that.\n\nLeaving there launched my career. About 9 years later and I more than doubled my income twice. In retrospect, I probably should have left sooner.",

The sooner you're gone the better. If it takes you a long time to get another job you'll be forced to help them with the transition for longer.",
            "I have been \"that guy from outside that they brought in\" a couple of times.  In both cases and in others where I was the one bringing in someone from outside in there were a couple of common elements why that happened.\n\n1. The person or their predecessor didn't set themselves up as a potential person that could take over **before** the situation arrived.  So the situation occurs and a vacancy is there so they take the person who can fill the role and view it as that the entire time.  A temporary situation.\n\nMy advice to my teams and others who ask for advice is to make your goals known and set yourself up BEFORE the role is there.  This means doing work on your own time to prepare yourself as well as on company time and dime if possible. The point is make it known as the company doesn't even know you have management aspirations, many do not and prefer to be senior individual contributors.\n\nThe person I respected the most was a very ambitious project manager who in interview and many times after that told me \"I want your job so help me to be ready for it and I will help you to be ready for the one above you\". When I was promoted who do you think got my previous job?\n\n2. The second thing is once in the role they wear the interim title formally or informally but you can tell they are just **holding the spot** as they never step out and strategize as it it is their role to lose.\n\nThe job becomes keeping  the lights on and following the previous leaders strategy instead of immediately developing your own strategy, fine tuning it and anything longer than 3 months starting to put that longer term strategy in practice.  If you believe they should do more x then present to upper management as if its your department and make it happen.  People tend to be timid in this time. They tend to be tactical and day to day operational and ignore the strategic planning and making decisions strategically.\n\nThe effect of both of these things are:  Upper management doesn't actually know you want to job and you are not actually showing them how you can step out of your other role and be the leader they need in the role.  So even though you kept the lights on that isn't what they want, they want a department leader who will keep the lights on AND think more strategically.\n\nI don't know your situation so I am just telling you what I have observed.  The people who didn't do the things above showed they were ready for promotion and typically got the jobs.  In fact I don't believe in interviewing for the open position above you.  If you show them what you can do the role should be yours.\n\nIt sounds like you had a couple of years to prove that you were ready.",
            "It's a lot easier to recruit a manager than it is to recruit highly skilled IT admins, If you've proven yourself to be the latter they would definitely rather keep you there than have to replace you if they promote you.\n\nSimilar thing happened to me, got told I didn't get the job because the way I answered certain questions in the interview was like a tech rather than a manager, even though the actual answers to the situations they provided were correct (basically, I said \"I would\" do things, rather than \"I would get my team\" to do things).\n\nThey then went a recruited a manager from external, and he left after a few months because he got a better offer.",
            ">What would you do?\n\nI have worked in state and local government since the 1990's, the last 20+ years in higher ed research. I'm at the same place I started at 20+ years ago, actually doing less today than I did when I started here as functionality has transitioned from local management (me) to central UITS as technology has progressed to allow my remote office to integrate into the UITS infrastructure.\n\nIn 20 years, I've applied for a dozen different jobs here. Like you, I have to apply for the jobs, there's no arbitrary promotion process. Some I was extremely qualified for, others not so much, and others over-qualified. I've been turned down for all but one, and that one they low-balled me on the salary (offering me $10k less than what I currently made, and as a public institution all of our salaries are public information, so they knew what I made and knew by low-balling me I wouldn't take the job).\n\nAt first it used to piss me off. Later, I really started not giving a shit. Sure, my job is boring. My skills have stagnated to mid 2000's technology. I'm not doing anything cutting edge, and unlikely to do anything in the future since most of the people I work with who do research (I'm in my early 60's) are older than me. One just died suddenly of a heart-attack a few weeks ago.\n\nWhat keeps me going? That 80% pension I'm going to get in a few more years. That's the prize. I can sit here all day, not bust my balls, not get calls at 1am, not work 60 hours a week, not have demanding assholes for users, surf the internet, read reddit, watch vids on interesting tech, play around with k8s and other things with some spare gear I have here, all the while each day that passes I'm honing in on that 80% pension.\n\nWith my 3% COLAs, I'll be pulling in close to $150k by then, and 80% will give me in the mid $120's as a pension. With survivor benefits for my wife, who is 20 years younger than I am and can collect it for the rest of her life. So in the end, I get to give them the middle finger on that one.\n\nSometimes my wife asks me why I don't leave and find something more interesting. To which I reply: why? Seriously, why do I want to leave and go work somewhere that could be a dumpster fire, I'm going to be busting my ass working 50+ hours a week, have shit benefits (I get 35 PTO days now plus another 26 discretionary leave days because technically I am \"on call\" in case the data center I manage ever catches on fire... and in 20+ years of being here, I've never received a single phone call, ever)... all for, if I'm lucky, the same pay as what I make now ($130k)\n\nSo what would I do? I can't answer that for you, because I don't know your situation. I don't know what your job is like, what your benefits are like, what your pension (if you have one) is like, etc. You have to weigh all of those things.\n\nYou have to make a list... of pros, and cons. And then you have to weigh those pros/cons against potential pros/cons if you swap jobs somewhere else. And in the end, make a value judgement.\n\nIs it worth leaving, and potentially losing those positive things you have, to eliminate the \"cons\", and is it worth the risk that if you left, the \"cons\" of a new position would outweigh the pros, or be even more than the cons of the current position you end.\n\nMe? My fat ass is staying right where it is, as I type this, in my private office in the back corner of the data center, looking out at my 24 42U racks of gear, where nobody bothers me. The only thing I ask is a good friend of mine, one of the secretaries here, come in and check on me once a day to make sure I haven't vapor-locked and start stinking up the place, because otherwise I can go weeks without any other human contact.\n\n80%... another 5 minutes closer to that goal as I typed this.

I zeroed in on you saying that you like the sysadmin part, and don't like the front office stuff. Would you really have liked the boss role? Yes, they likely took advantage of you, and yes, it stings to be passed over, (oh, and I'm assuming the other role probably had a significant pay bump as well), but don't force yourself into a bad situation.\n\nSomeone on Reddit once made a comment like \"if you're in a technical role and someone offers you a manager position, remember, that's not a promotion, that's a career change\".\n\nIf you don't want to move into management, that's perfectly fine! You are at an inflection point in your career where you still may want to evaluate your career path and see if you want to make any adjustments. You may be at a dead end if you want to stay in a technical role, and may want to change jobs.\n\nIf you do want to move up, there are a few things to reflect on. When you were in the interim role, were you fully covering the position, or did they use you as a technical lead while other people covered other parts of your old boss's job? I've seen situations like that where the interim manages the schedule and provides day-to-day supervision and direction, but another manager (or several of them) temporarily handles budgeting, vendor negotiations, strategic planning, or whatever. You may have been doing wonderfully at the role you filled, but that may not have reflected what the permanent role will be. How well did you transition to the supervisory aspect? I've seen people step into leadership roles and forget that as \"THE BOSS\" the things they say and do can come across very differently than when they are a co-worker.\n\nYour work \\*may\\* still be valued, they just may find you more valuable in your current role at this time. I know, I know... a pat on the back and an \"attaboy joeyl5, you really helped us out of a jam\" is a crappy consolation prize if you expected a promotion.\n\nIf you do want to step up to the boss role, reach out to upper management and #1) let them know you're interested ^((from other comments it sounds like you specifically interviewed for the permanent role, so I'd say you have that covered!)). #2) ask what it would take for you to get there in the future. In some environments, it may be an educational checkbox (you may need anything from \"any bachelor's degree\" to an MBA to be considered for the next tier). Maybe they need to see someone with specific skill sets. Maybe you need to hone your interpersonal skills to be able to advocate for your department at the next level of management. Especially in a state environment, they likely have some very specific criteria to follow. Some of those items may be obscenely easy for you to fill, once you understand how to document them.\n\nIt's also possible that you just need to be the attorney general's frat brother's kid, or the governor's wife's nephew. It may be clear that you can't get there (unless you get adopted by or married to someone in power).\n\nOne other thought: you were in a supervisory role, now you're \"just\" another sysadmin. You'll probably get some blowback from the people you used to supervise (whether you were an awesome or crappy supervisor, there will be decisions you made that some won't like, among other issues). Worse for you: if you were any good at all, your former reporting employees will still look to you for leadership when the new person arrives. That will create friction between you and the new boss. Any time I've seen someone temporarily elevated to a position of \"power\", it's created strain when they're returned to the old normal. Sometimes they're able to work around it, but most often the interim leader needs to move on to another team. \n\nIf that's the situation for you, it kind of sucks, but you can probably use this as a stepping stone. \"Why'd you leave your last position?\" \"Well, I discovered I had an interest and some talent in leading teams instead of just being on one, I wasn't the best fit for the permanent role at that time because of X and Y, but I went an did A and B, and feel ready for the role you have here at XYZ corp\". Or \"Well, I filled a temporary leadership role, that's not the right fit for me, but I was happy to help out when needed, and when it ended it was a natural time to start looking for a more challenging technical position\".\n\nGood luck in whatever direction you go. You're on the right track by taking a bit of time to regroup, and not making a purely emotional decision.",

            "While the situation is shitty,  you aren't given a lot of back ground to go on.  No sure how long you've been there, how long you've been a sysadmin or trying to be a leader.   However,  before getting really salty about it -  I'd ask yourself a couple of questions. \n\n\\-Did you want the leadership position because you wanted to be a manager,  or did you think it was just a natural progression?\n\n\\-You love being a sysadmin,  do think you could have taken your hands off the keyboards? \n\nA lot of folks mistakenly think that \"a good/ great sysadmin\" will make a great manager and that simple isn't the case.  Of course it will make some conversations easier, but the people and politicking side of being a leader can be difficult if that's not what you are focused on. \n\nWhen you become a leader, your hands need to come off the keyboard and you need to work on growing / protecting and caring for your team.  Were you at a place that you could have done that? \n\nMy bet -  You have a blind-spot that no one has pointed out to you.  You are great with the technology but have room to grow on politicking  / diplomacy side of the house, and either didn't work on it or actively talked about how much you didn't like it. \n\nThis is a sour pill to swallow at times, I myself have gone though it a few time at my current company before finally getting into leadership. The thing I learned with each failed attempt was that 1) I still had things to work on, 2) the person they chose was actually better for a number of reasons and turned out to be folks that continued to mentor and help me grow and 3) though I didn't learn this till years down the road after I finally got into leadership,  I wasn't as ready as I thought I was.  My perspective was still very green. \n\nOther things to think about,  they may have actually liked and wanted to support you in the role as leader.  But, depending on what else was going on with your leadership , they may not have thought they had the time to take on mentoring of a new leader right now.   The first 12-18 months of being a leader can be a bit eye opening, and not something that can honestly be readily prepped for.  It also takes a LOT of time to get the person ramped up,  think of it like a jr. admin.  Sometimes you have the time to take on that project of ramping up someone new in role, and other times you just need someone that is more or less plug and play. \n\nLastly,  and this is a conversation that I have with folks all the time who call me about going after leadership roles.   I ask them what they have been doing over the last 24 months to prepare them to be a leader?   Self-improvement, humility and and awareness that one isn't perfect and have already taken the steps to improve themselves goes a long way into judging how ready a candidate is to being a leader.  You focus must also have evolved from technology to people and processes.   I've interviewed aspiring leaders who talked about tech & systems issues the entire time  and barely mentioned the people side of the equation, which is a clear sign they weren't ready. \n\nBrushing up your resume is always a good thing,  but honestly,  let the dust settle for a week or so and then get a 1:1 with some of the hiring managers.  Thank them for the opportunity to go for the role and let them know implicitly (if true) that you still want to be a leader.  To help with that endeavor you would like to have some brutally honest feedback on your blind spots / readiness and items you should work on.  In addition,  ask them for a leadership mentor outside you current reporting structure.    If they do all of this, it might be worth sticking around as it demonstrates investment and support in getting you to the next level. \n\nhope this helps.",

            ">I do love being a sysadmin and not have to do front office kind of things.\n\nI'm confused: do you want to remain a technical independent contributor (sysadmin), or do you want to move into management of a technical team (front office, is my read?)?  This sentence implies that you prefer being a sysadmin, not a manager of sysadmins.  So you should be relieved that they finally hired someone to take your non-sysadmin load.  Perhaps you can negotiate a pay raise as a technical manager/team lead with the new manager.  Won't be immediate but you can pave they way for a raise at the next cycle by working closely with the new manager.\n\nFigure that out first: technical IC or manager track?  If you want to go into management, you have some things to find out before you leave this place.  Read on.\n\nNext question: you applied for the role your boss vacated approximately THREE YEARS ago.  Did they actually interview you for it?  If not...you need to find out WHY not.  If they DID interview you, you need to find out their impressions.\n\n(sidebar: A role that you have been at least partly filling as a team lead, maybe people manager, since then and never officially granted via title or compensated for with a pay increase, yes?  That's far too long take on that responsibility without a raise; should have brought it up with your interim manager as part of the first year's review cycle. )\n\nI'm not trying to nit-pick you.  I'm going to take your post at face value and view you through the best possible light based on the details you've provided, and make the following assumptions:\n\n* You did not make decisions on your team's pay increases (literally: did not sit with HR and determine who would get what raise or bonus dollar amounts during annual reviews).  Do correct me if I'm wrong, but are you or were you able to look up the current salary and bonus schedule for what you refer to as \"my staff\" above?  \n* It is possible and likely that you were asked to provide info for their annual reviews, but I would wonder if you literally filled out the HR forms for those reviews yourself or not.  I don't say this to nit-pick you or downplay your contribution, but as a people manager myself, if you have direct access to an employee's annual review, you likely have direct access to ALL of their past performance history.  That should not be something that someone who is not actually a manager is allowed to view.\n* Certainly you managed their assignments and work schedules.  100% you stepped up.\n\nBack to my original question: do you want to be a people manager?  If so, your next step is to ask whoever hired your boss' replacement why they did not choose you.  **Be calm and frame it as you seeking to know how to succeed the next time an opportunity to move into management comes your way.**  You might be surprised to learn how people around you see you when you're able to solicit information in this way.  And they are not always correct - they often see the things you did in the wrong way.  Your challenge as someone interested in management - and this grows even harder as you move into management - is communication and ensuring that you and the other people in the room with you all have the same idea/expectations.  You spend more time figuring out HOW to say something than you actually spend saying it...the first time.  Then you spend a lot more time re-stating it to the people who interpreted it differently from what you intended.  If you're lucky, you get a critical mass of understanding such that other people can course-correct on your behalf without taking up more of your own time.\n\nYou can't roll back the clock and un-hire whoever they just hired.  You CAN and should learn why you were overlooked before you jump ship and risk making the same mistakes at the next place.  You MIGHT consider allying yourself with the new Greenhorn as a team lead or tech lead or technical manager (whatever the title at your place is) who handles scheduling and prioritization but does not handle HR stuff and performance evaluations, and make it clear to Greenhorn that you want to move into management and are looking to Greenhorn to lead you to your next promotion.

            "One thing that's unmentioned: spend a lot of time shadowing the more senior SAs.  Good SAs will be willing to teach you those ropes.\n\nAnother thing: a huge part of being an SA is telling people \"no\", or telling people things like \"that's a bad idea\".  This is particularly common when interfacing with software developers or with management.  In SA role, you will find a **lot** of other people don't know what what the hell they're doing (especially with software) and make very poor choices.  Help teach them why those are bad choices, and -- if possible (but it sometimes isn't!) -- come to the table with some alternatives.\n\nWe SAs have, sadly, become the \"jack of all trades\" due to the natures of what we do.  We sit at the layer that is in the smack centre of everything, which means we effectively have to know a lot about a lot of things.  The 3 big ones are general system behaviour, troubleshooting anything (and I do mean anything!), and networking.  Good SAs are able to interface with DevOps folks, InfoSec folks, pure software developers, and networking administrators.  Network admins in particular **really** appreciate having an SA that understands networking, all the way down to analysing packet captures.",
            "You're really in a great position to kick off your career. 1.5 years on the help desk is nothing compared to most people and you have a great opportunity to learn under people who aren't expecting a higher skill level than you actually have. \n\nI look at it like this: 1.5 years isn't too soon to transition off help desk. Any time is a good time as long as you have the resources you need to learn. You're going to rapidly ascend in your IT knowledge over the next 2 years and that could happen now, or after spending 10 years grinding out help desk like it does for many. But those 8 years are a hell of a lot less valuable than your next 2 will be. \n\nI work in a very different environment than you so I can't give a lot of tech advice, but on the personal front I'd highly recommend just making yourself available and enthusiastic all the time. You'll pick up a lot of the work nobody else wants to do, but soon enough you'll get pulled into bigger and bigger projects. Unlike the help desk, this type of work really does run through a system of favors and reputation.",

You should want to do a good job. if your intentions are good only worry about things that are within your control.\n\nSecond rule, as soon as you are the smartest person in the room, find a new room.\n\nThird rule, a successful career is not built on IT knowledge alone. Know your audience. Executives, managers, and coworkers should be communicated to completely differently. Build personal relationships with those people who have your best interests in mind and those who can offer you something in the form of knowledge or additional pay. The rest of the people are grifters and should not be stressed over.\n\nFourth rule, you are young and just starting a career which technology changes every few years. This gives you an advantage that most senior people don't have. While boomer senior engineer is taking long vacations and attending his daughters dance recitals, you are watching youtube videos or posting on forums. This part of your career is your 'growth time' where you can take it as far as you want to put in the effort. You can in one weekend learn more than most people will bother to learn in an entire year. Use it to your advantage. Be intellectually curious. Dive into things. You mentioned Azure, try using terraform to deploy a secure application with a website hosted on azure web app with an azure SQL back-end that is connecting to a datalake. After, use a datafactory to automatically ingest data into that database to drive your web app. If you don't know what any of this is, even better... because once you accomplish it, you will already be better than 99% of /r/sysadmin users at modern technology.\n\nFifth, get out now before it's too late.

        "title": "Possible Job Transition",
        "content": "Friends,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWondering if anyone else here has experience/insight into a move I am considering. I have been a managed services technician for the past 10 years with what started out as a local MSP. During my time with the company they have grown substantially and now have over 30 offices across the US compared to just the 3 they had when I started. I really enjoy the technical aspects of my job and have a great relationship with my peers. In the past I have been prodded about my interests in management level positions, I had zero interest. However, over the last year my view has changed. I dont see myself as a MS tech in another ten years time (currently 35 years old). However, the only real path to escalation is into a project deployment/rework type of role. I honestly have no interest in that. I enjoy putting out fires daily but going into an environment and having to rework the entire thing (typically with old software/hardware) just has no appeal to me. My direct supervisor is taking another role in the company and they are going to be hiring for that position. This position would basically be a supervisor level position in charge of the team that I am currently on (6 technicians) as well as another team of 5 techs who do the same thing just for a different set of clients. The role would obviously take me out of the tech trenches and I would have very little to do from a technical standpoint. The job would encompass hiring/firing, leadership discussions, billing review, client interfacing/onboarding. Basically everything required on the Managed Services side except for the technical stuff. I am a very likeable, social person and can see myself settling into a leadership role with some work but I still have my reservations. I have friendships (some of them started when I began working here) with people that I would now be supervising. We are all very independent and hardworking adults. I know that respect would not be something that I would need to worry about. We have built trust in eachother over the years to know that the people you work with are always going to have your back and help in any way they can. This would simply be continued in a management type role. I just don't know exactly how a move like this would impact our work relationships. As I said, I love the people I work with and the culture that we have. The current supervisor is easily able to maintain a balance of being \"one of the crew\" while still wearing that supervisor hat. I don't think it would be any different for me but I just dont know for sure. Every single person I have talked to at the company feels that I would be a great fit for this role. Another consideration to this is that a move into management would open positions to me outside of the IT field should I ever want to do that. All of this rambling is basically to see if anyone else has made a similar move in their career. If so, what challenges did you face? Would you do it again given the chance? Are there things you wish you had done different or focused more on during the transition? TYIA",

            "\"Wall of Text crits your eyes for 9.000 damage!\"\n\nSeriously though, you are over thinking this. I worked at an MSP/Reseller for a time and then I moved to one of their largest clients and it was the best move I ever did. The next 15 years I stayed in contact with my friends and the management team at the MSP and they are still my VAR of choice many more years later. \n\nIn fact, before I left the client, I worked to bring in a semi-close friend from the VAR who is now finally in the exec suite after I left to do something different in a different state. \n\nYour friends will understand and support you, if you find out they don't then they are not friends.

My experience isn't unique. Look at this sub. You'll see PLENTY of people with the same experience. If you want high figures, go into another field.

Certifications are good, but getting an IT degree is probably not a great idea at this point for you until you\u2019re already in some type of IT position.

It\u2019s not late at all relax lol!! Put that work in and do your thing!!! Good luck you got it!!",

It will make you look, feel and express positivity including how to handle jobs",

            "Hell no, especially IT, it\u2019s a very good career because it is actually growing still, I got into it at over 40. If you are in law enforcement and really even if you weren\u2019t I recommend IT security. I have done regular IT Helpdesk, network/software administration, and my favorite job was a trucking company I worked at. I would support all 5 terminals they had and their trucking software along with training people in classes on MS Office when I had people in need. I would travel to LA, ND, CO & UT to train truckers and office personnel on the trucking software, also I trained IT people to take over the software. I started my career as a manufacturing technician/mechanic for almost 20 years. IT surprisingly gave me the same rush as fixing machines when I was done with a task. There are so many different areas of IT but security is an absolute need. I hope this helps.",
            "In the US for tech, there is no age discrimination. Over 6 years ago, I got a friend in his late 30's doing help desk walk up as his job. During job interviews, they get a feel of your personality and what type  of energy you will be bringing into the workplace besides just skills, knowledge, and qualifications. Sometimes, if you don't have those 3, but the energy and passion are there, you can still get hired on. I seened it.",

            "Put it into perspective. Many others are doing the same in the military. Many get out well into their 30s and so on and go into the IT field. I'm 31 currently and transitioning out of the Army now.",
            "Nope.  59. Still studying networking",
            "Why do people think the older they get the more they can't do things? Your age doesn't hold you back you hold yourself back. You can still go and study or work even if you're 90 as long as you believe in yourself anything is possible. Of course I'm exaggerating on 90 years old but I sure as hell hope to be able to continue learning about the things I want when I'm that old!",
            "I'm 41 studying for CompTIA Networking+ since at this rate ill be stuck at dead end jobs the test of my life, and theres no way i can rely on social security for retirement, because i refuse to rely on my daughter when im retired",

            "Bro that depends on you! I'm 59 and I've changed careers multiple times. Like hold my beer watch this. If you are interested in it then go all in, if you don't really enjoy it then any career change will be a slow slog towards decent pay. \nExamples\nElectronic Engineer\nSystems Engineer\nFiber optic test equipment \nSemiconductor equipment engineer\nThen Director, CTO, CISO (great pay, but too much politics for me)\nIntelligence Analyst\nProject Management\nProgram management\nThen IT,\nThen IT Project Management\nAnd finally  Cyber Security first on defense side and recently on the offense side.\n\nSmashed them all, because I had a true interest in all of them and when I got bored, I had someone hold my beer again\ud83d\ude01\n\nYou are never too old to do anything you put your mind to.

Began working toward degree and applying for jobs in IT, eventually landing an entry level position at a FINTECH company as a Computer operator. 4 months later a spot opened up for a Security Administrator. Applied. My background in military and LE gave me the edge and after 3 interviews I landed the position. Still working as a sec admin and loving it. \n\nI'm still a year away from finishing my degree. I had zero prior IT experience. I'm 32 years old and I started the transition into IT near the end of 2022. \n\nYou are not too old. Go crush it man. Make more money. WAY LESS STRESS. Spend more time with your family. Find a hobby. \n\nEnjoy.",

            "I got my first IT job when I was 32.\n\nOf course I started when I was 29.\n\nMy advice for you is to keep it at an associates level at first, as actual work experience is a lot more valuable than anything higher than an AS (at first.)\n\nAlmost any entry level job will probably not require a college degree. Having one is good because it shows that you can learn new things. But from an entry level standpoint, an AS proves that as much as a BS, But one is twice as expensive. \n\nIf you master the art of online, nights and weekends School. You can always go back after a few months in your first job to finish your BS. \n\nIf you want a job while you're going back to school, try substitute teaching if you already have a 4-year degree. Ironically that's how I broke the IT barrier, as I now do IT work for schools.",

        "title": "Got my first cybersecurity interview only 2.5 months into my career change",
        "content": "Background info on me: i am 23 years old, i went to college for a few semesters before dropping out, and worked in healthcare for 3.5 years, from 2020-2024 (i was a pharmacy technician, and then became a pediatric medical assistant). During this time i also was into web design, and i started freelancing on the side in my free time and making websites for friends, myself, and small businesses here and there (2021-2023). In December of 2023 i started an LLC for web design, and i had 2 overseas employees working for me on a contract basis, and i would serve as project manager. I expanded our services to include web hosting as well, and now we manage web hosting services for a handful of our clients.\n\nOk boom. In july of 2024, i saw a youtube video that was titled \u201cstart your cybersecurity career in 7 days\u201d. While it did pique my initial interest snd curiosity, i was obviously skeptical because i had been hearing about how cybersecurity isnt entry level. That youtube video changed my life. After watchin that YouTube video, i go t the following certifications in a few days: qualys vulnerability management, detection, and response (VMDR), Qualys cybersecurity asset management (CSAM), and qualys vulnerability management scanning (VMS). From there i started getting into cybersecurity youtube, and started finding more free courses. I started the google cybersecurity professional certif\u00edcate program, and i loved it. It gave me hands on experience with linux, sql, and python, (3 things i had NEVER used or even seen before). I became obsessed. I started doing TONS of projects, labs, and activities that would help strengthen my skills and resume. Besides those 3 languages, the google course also gave me experience with tcpdump, wireshark, and google chronicle. While i was taking the google course i was also doing some free cybersecurity virtual experience programs on the forage. I completed the mastercard cybersecurity program, the datacom cybersecurity program, the PwC switzerland cybersecurity program, the commonwealth bank intro to cybersecurity program, and most recently the Telstra cybersecurity SOC program. From these i gained hands on skills in other things, like  splunk, cybersecurity engineering, SOC incident response, and more. While i was doing all of this, i was slowly creating and building up both my resume and portfolio, and adding cybersecurity recruiters on linkedin.\n\nAfter completing the google course (which took me exactly two months coincidentally; july 24- september 24th) i started applying to jobs. I was spamminggggg applications and sending messages to recruiters. I just started applying to jobs last friday (september 21st) and sent out probably 200 applications in total. Yesterday, i got my first invitation to an interview, and it was for a cybersecurity analyst position at a bank. I almost shed tears of happiness because of how happy i was that all of my hard work is paying off. Obviously i understand its only an interview, and i dont have the job yet, but still it was so rewarding to see that email, and feel as though my endless hard work for the past few months has been paying off. I am still going to apply for more jobs, and continue to further my education and skills.\n\nI am going to get my compTIA Security+ soon (now that i have the 30% discount voucher i received from the google cybersecurity course) and i also scheduled the free ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity exam for november 6th. I cant wait to keep adding onto my list of skills and certifications. Ive been obsessed with cybersecurity lately, and i hope to make this my new career. \n\nEdit: also, a few ppl have asked about my portfolio, so im going to link it here: [my cybersecurity journey](https://justingoncalves34.github.io/Cybersecurity_Journey/)\n\nEdit 2: didnt get the job\ud83d\ude15 ill keep studying though, completing courses, and adding projects and experience along my journey. Hopefully i get something soon!",

The staffing companys relationships trumped my lack of experience, and almost no worries on \"interviews\" since they would pretty much take you on if you fit and were willing to keep learning. Depending on where you live, and what salary your targeting  you should be able to move up fairly quickly from let's say 50k-75k within 1 year. After 70k and up you will need more experience.

I never directly said the above though. I shared stories that demonstrated those abilities.\n\nGreet your interviewer and show them a bit of your social side when appropriate such as in the very beginning and the end.\n\nYou don't need to be stone cold serious all the time.

My short term goal is to get my foot in the door with a helpdesk or general entry level IT job. I am also currently studying for CompTIA+. So far, I am not having any luck in finding an entry level IT job. I have years of management experience and am currently a police officer. I feel as if companies see this and realize I have ZERO IT experience and immediately shut me down. Besides the compTIA+ cert, is there anything I can do to make myself more marketable for an entry level position? I am very aware that getting straight into cyber with a 6 figure salary is a common pipe dream. I am willing to put in the work and take a massive pay cut to gain the experience. I just need a company to give me a chance and would love some constructive criticism. TIA!  ",

You still have to get the certs and digital forensics is not easy BUT it ties into your current field.

You need to have a 4 year degree and some high level certs. I\u2019ve seen some jobs want a masters degree. If you\u2019re willing to stay at a low paying job like help desk for long enough until you get a 4 year bachelors and then your advanced certifications, you could probably break in. I have the trifecta and I\u2019m only working helping desk. There\u2019s people with advanced certifications I work with and they have a bachelors degree and they still work help desk. It\u2019s very tough to break into cybersecurity.",
            "I am in a similar situation as you. The best advice, grind out the certs as quickly as possible. I also am switching career fields in my thirties, but from military intelligence, which has given me a leg up clearance wise and vet preference but not a lot else. I separated earlier this year and started grinding out my A+ and NET+ within a few months and about to finish SEC+. \n\nI just got my first job as a contractor working within the DoD in entry IT and that was mostly because of what others have suggested, network network network. Make a professional LinkedIn and start contacting some recruiters. \n\nI would also highly recommend putting the certification you are currently studying for in your resume with the test date. That helped me actually land the gig I\u2019m in currently. Lastly, I\u2019d suggest getting your SEC+ and apply for any job willing to sponsor you for a clearance. They are very rare and typically want someone already cleared, but it\u2019s possible. Good luck and feel free to ask any questions you want!",
            "Transitioning from a career in law enforcement to cybersecurity can be a rewarding shift, and your resume should highlight the skills and experiences that make you a unique and valuable candidate for a cybersecurity role. Here are some key points you might consider including:  \n\n\n1. \\*\\*Problem-Solving Skills\\*\\*: Emphasize your experience in problem-solving and critical thinking, as these are crucial skills in both law enforcement and cybersecurity.\n2. \\*\\*Attention to Detail\\*\\*: Highlight your attention to detail, an essential skill for both investigating crimes and identifying security breaches or vulnerabilities in systems.\n3. \\*\\*Experience with Law and Regulations\\*\\*: Mention any specific experience you have with law, regulations, and compliance, as understanding legal aspects is often important in cybersecurity roles.\n4. \\*\\*Handling Sensitive Information\\*\\*: Your experience in handling confidential or sensitive information in law enforcement can be a significant asset in cybersecurity, where protecting sensitive data is key.\n5. \\*\\*Communication Skills\\*\\*: Law enforcement roles often require strong communication skills, which are equally important in cybersecurity for explaining technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.\n6. \\*\\*Technology Skills\\*\\*: If you have any specific technical skills or have used technology extensively in your policing role, be sure to list these. Any familiarity with cybersecurity tools or concepts is a plus.\n7. \\*\\*Stress Management\\*\\*: Your ability to remain calm and effective under pressure is a valuable skill, especially in incident response roles within cybersecurity.\n8. \\*\\*Teamwork and Leadership\\*\\*: Experience in working as part of a team and any leadership roles you've held are important to mention.\n9. \\*\\*Continuous Learning\\*\\*: Cybersecurity is a field that requires ongoing learning due to its rapidly evolving nature. Highlight your commitment to continuous learning and professional development, perhaps through courses or certifications you\u2019ve pursued.\n10. \\*\\*Certifications or Relevant Training\\*\\*: If you have taken any courses or certifications related to cybersecurity, like CompTIA Security+, Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), or others, make sure to list them.\n11. \\*\\*Transferable Skills\\*\\*: Identify and articulate transferable skills from your law enforcement career that would be beneficial in cybersecurity, such as investigative techniques, risk assessment, and emergency response management.\n12. \\*\\*Real-World Scenarios\\*\\*: If possible, provide examples where you applied your skills in real-world scenarios that could be analogous to cybersecurity situations, such as dealing with cybercrimes or digital evidence in your policing role.Remember to tailor your resume to each specific job you're applying for, highlighting the most relevant experiences and skills for each position. Networking within the cybersecurity community can also be beneficial, as it can provide insight into the industry and potentially lead to job opportunities.",
            "I\u2019ll offer a different route to cybersecurity. I hear people talk about the help desk route as the way into to cyber. I happen to think that that route  will be the slowest and will pay the least until you actually get to a decent role. I also may add that it will probably be the most stressful. \n  I\u2019ll offer an alternative. Learn some coding. In particular python, JavaScript or maybe even java. Get familiar with apis and how the cloud works. Try to find an entry level job in that OR take some very cheap freelance jobs on upwork. I mean something like $20 for very quick tasks. Do a couple of those, to build your reputation and experience. Then start transitioning to cyber with a few entry level certs like network+ and security+. At that point apply for roles in application security (Appsec). \n In total this route might take about 2-3 years but you will get to a higher paying job faster with less stress. Just my 2 cents, which doesn\u2019t mean anything. \n And yes this is very similar to the route I took.",

Being able to put this on my resume opened so many new IT doors. While \u201cworking 2 jobs\u201d wasn\u2019t ideal, I sacrificed 4 months of social life for a lifetime of salary increases. It was stressful and exhausting but paid off in spades when my first IT gig was a 60% pay increase from the job I was stuck in.  \n\n(Funny how the grass is seems greener\u2026I personally would love to be a cop if I could do my youth all over again haha)",

You should easily be able to get a job. All help desk is, is explaining to end users how to network, navigate, or use software (at least in my case). \n\nI wouldn't get into helpdesk honestly,  or if you do 1-3 months max, at least that's what I'm doing. \n\nYou got it this tho, good luck bro.

            "I knew a guy who did exactly what you are looking at.   \nEntirely possible. He had to move to a new area though because we live in a cornfield.  \n\n\nHis roadmap was simple. He got an associates in IT at our local community college (I dont remember the specific one but know that the networking degree at the school included security class). Then went on to a 4 year degree program at Western Governors in cyber security. He worked as a LEO for maybe 15 years+/-. He knocked out certs as he went in school.  \n\n\nPart of what is holding you back in getting your foot at the door is that companies have a hard time trusting a person with no official IT experience. As odd as it may sound given your work and mgmnt exprience, an internship may be a great place to start. I realize it is not ideal but its a trust gap that you have to overcome.   \n\n\nMy first break into IT came exactly as an internship and morphed into a full time position. I was essentially a network technician and occasional help desk (small company so many roles). Eventually they were able to recognize other skills I already had vs what I was working toward and offered a lateral transition that was mutually beneficial. I now work in marketing, similar pay scale and the simple truth I am more impactful so I feel a bit more accomplished when I head home for the day.  \n\n\nEventually I would like to get into net admin but also recognize that living in a corn field has limitations unless im willing to move. That is currently not an option so we wait until it is more possible.",

I recently got laid off from my job as a Product Manager at a tech company, and I'm now looking to transition into cybersecurity. A bit about me: I'm 24, have a degree in Computer Science, and I've just started studying for the CompTIA Security+ exam.\n\nI'm interested in areas like GRC, consulting, and I'm open to exploring different fields within cybersecurity, but I know I don't want to code all the time or be a Security Engineer. I don't know all the possible career paths in cybersecurity, so I'd love for people to mention other roles that might suit me!\n\nI'd appreciate advice on:\n\n1. Should I be studying for any other certifications aside from Security+ to help me get started?\n2. What are the best ways to find entry-level cybersecurity roles?\n3. Any tips or suggestions for someone with my background on where to focus in the cybersecurity world?\n\nThanks so much for any help or guidance!",
        "comments": [
            "For starters, finding an entry-level job in the GRC domain is hard. \n\ni would suggest you upskill yourself with GRC certifications and a pinch of technical certs as well. \n\ncerts you can start with ISC2-CC ( free exam)  , Azure-SC900 , iso 27001 LI , CCNA, NET+\n\niso 27001 LI cert might give you a chance to get an internship or associate-level job coupled with sec+ and other certs.\n\nCybersecurity is vast. you have to choose your domain be it GRC, pentest, SOC, vulnerability assessment, cloud security, network security, or data protection.  all these fields have their own set of certifications. so choose wisely according to your interest",
            "Get your CISSP. There are no entry-level CS roles - you'll need YEARS of verifiable Sys Admin, Network Engineer experience. \n\nCyber is a group of jobs that requires you to be a very hands-on, technical person. So, that's what you need to aim for. If you're looking at compliance and/or risk, CISSP.",
            "GRC typically isn\u2019t an entry level position but I think your CS degree gives you a leg up. If you get an entry level job doing IT risk assessments or even IT auditing, you\u2019ll have a chance to break into GRC. You mention consulting - have you looked for entry level positions the Big 4 places at all? Ernst Young (EY), Price Waterhouse Cooper (PWC), Deloitte, etc. Might be a good place to start. It\u2019s not a forever place to stay but looks great on a resume and would give you a lot of experience.",
            "don't do it. There is no job you can get with just a cert. You will need years of hands on real world experience of managing an enterprise level network as a network or sys admin. security is a mid leave path once you already have IT experience, its not something you can just switch into without it."

I'm (28F) currently working in furniture sales but do not want to do that long term and currently cannot afford to go back to school (I just paid off my private loans and do not want to take out anymore loans). I've always been interested in IT and have identified that I wish to pursue cyber security. I see the CompTIA offers Security as one of their certifications and did peruse the career roadmap that CompTIA offers but I do have some fundamental questions: should I take the core exams? Should I learn how to code and what languages? How do I market myself post certifications (I have an English degree)? \n\nAny advice will be helpful as I am overwhelmed if this is a viable decision and how to beat move forward. Thank you!!",

            "We suggest that you be wary of false or misleading promises with regard to cybersecurity jobs. The phrase going around for cybersecurity hiring right now is, \"There isn't a lack of vacancies. There is a lack of qualified applicants.\"\n\nWe would recommend that you start with the CompTIA A+, secure an entry level IT position, and then move into a cybersecurity role after you have put time in and proven your abilities.\n\nProgramming language knowledge is not required. Your English degree is a plus, even if it's not specific to IT.\n\nThis probably wasn't the answer you were looking for, but we hope it proves helpful nonetheless. \u2764\ufe0f",
            "Cyber security is not an entry level position. To know how to keep systems safe you have to know how they work. The thing you have going for you is your sales experience. That equates to customer service. That alone may be good enough to get your foot in the door in a help desk position. From there learn, learn, learn some more, pile some certs, and then go after that dream job.",
            "You need to learn, and take every cert in their suggested roadmaps. You'll need a STEM degree eventually. \n\nPrepare to work yeas in help desk and Sys admin jobs before anybody considers you for Cybersecurity. \n\nIts a mid career job. Its like wanting to be a judge without going to law school, and working years as a lawyer.\n\nI started at 28. Worked in warehouses up until that point.\n\nIts viable if you are ambitious.  Lots of work and a lot to learn. Youll be competing with people who have all the things above."

        "content": "Dear Nerds, \n\nI hope you are all healthy and happy and are managing to grind out that study at whatever pace you can. \n\nI'm writing this brief entry partly to pat myself on the back, but mostly just in case it can help anyone who is currently on the same journey.\n\nAs I mentioned in the title, I have successfully changed career after using all this pandemic lockdown time to study and pass the A+ and N+. Like many of you, I've not had the smoothest year; big future plans got dashed to the wind, family emergencies and losses, prolonged isolation, etc... I'm a different person now than I was before this all started. \n\nI was never an A* student, and studying never came naturally to me, so it took a bit longer than a lot of others before felt like I was ready to take the exams. Fortunately for my bank account, I was able to pass each exam first time. \n\nI've been very lucky with the job-hunting process. After having applied for only a handful of positions (most of which were not IT-related at all - several were cleaning positions in hospitals, all of which rejected my application), I received a very swift response from a company offering an interview for what I consider a pretty perfect entry-level role. And so, shortly I shall begin training for a 1st Line Technical Support position for a non-customer-facing, in-house IT department. It's with a great company, with a great support network, and a clear route for progression. \n\nI'm so happy I've been able to pull it off, despite everything. But mostly, I'm just super relieved. I thought that a career change at this point in my life would be impossible. I was so comfortable in my last job (it was low pay, but relaxed and easygoing, and with nice people), and I couldn't bear the thought of studying or interviewing ever again... Still, it's all done now, I made it, and I'm super excited to start a new journey. I've even learned that I actually love studying so long as it's something I'm interested in!  \n\nTo anyone out there currently struggling to study, or putting it off because it's too daunting, I get it. It's scary as hell. But if you whittle away at it consistently, even if some days you can only manage 20 minutes or so, it'll all snowball, and you'll get it. For sure. \n\nThanks for all the support along the way. I haven't posted much, but I've lurked lots and this community helped way more than I thought it would! \n\nTake it easy!\n\nJ",

            "Same here. I lost my job of 24 years in the casino industry due to Covid. I did not want to go back to that industry. I had a small but passionate background in computing. I got my A+ and a secret clearance from the government and landed a job making close to what it took me 24 years to work up to in the casino biz. \n\nAnd my next step up will greatly clear what my bosses in the casino industry were making which could have taken me another decade in the biz. \n\nAdded bonus: I like the quiet environment and the work.",

I went after every assignment , every menial task like it was my job to save the planet.\nOh and it helps to be nice to everyone along the way.\nI learned early on that success in IT sometimes comes in form of perception is greater than reality . If you do good but not great work but your pleasant to work with people will seek you out to help them. That relationship building with pay off. I literally have one cert A+ it\u2019s over 20 years old . Win 95 era but It got in me in the door.

            "Yes. Although the market for lower tier jobs is over saturated because of covid. Depending on where you live finding a help desk position paying 48-55k isn\u2019t to difficult. Getting the trifecta of certs is great but they are just basic certs you would want to get those and grab a few certs specializing in a few fields. My advice ,as someone who made the jump in 2020 from doing landscaping to now working a desktop position, just study get those certs and keep gaining experience. I know how you\u2019re feeling but IT is a good field to get into without a degree. Although you will be picked over by people with degrees and military exp quite often and that\u2019s fine the future is computers keep applying.",
            "Yes, especially since you're so young (trust me, 28 is nothing for someone trying to start their career over)\n\nI've worked with at least a dozen IT professionals who had no college education at all and were making over 6 figures in the southern U.S. \n\nTotally doable, you just have to put in the time and push through all the rejection",
            "Short answer is yes. You don't need a degree. You just need to show that you will do what it takes to learn. You will have to start at the bottom. Look and see if there are any local small MSP's looking to hire. Start there and gain experience. Take certs only if its required. Certs can help as they are HR filters. Degree's in IT is a little strange. I started with no degree and no certs and had a ton over experience and went back after 20+ years and did an AAS degree because it was free in my state. I am now at over 35 years in my career and decided to go back and get a BSCIA. I do have A+, Net+ and Sec+ among others as they are required for the degree and was easier for me to just knock them out before I start. I guess what I am saying is you can always go back and get a degree if you want. The degree may help if you want to move up higher in management for a large company. I am actually senior management and have been before I had any degree. Hopefully you can land an entry level job and shadow someone really good thats willing to get you up to speed. Once you get the basics down everything will click really fast.",
            "I am trying to do the same and have just completed the trifecta\u2026still no job though.  There were tons of layoffs in tech and now us noobs are competing with folks that have YEARS of experience and twice the certs. It\u2019s not impossible but it takes dedication. All this to say, don\u2019t quit your job, do the studies on the side and apply in the background. It\u2019s rough out there!",

A master's degree is only helpful if you have 10+ years of experience and are planning on going into management.

            "You can always got to WGU for IT and get these certs included in the cost of tuition. Just fyi\n\nspez: and the way it works is you can take as many classes as you want in a 6 month term. Meaning if you are not restricted to a 4 year curriculum you can go as fast as you want",
            "Possible. But even if you do, you'll be on the lower rungs of salary. IT is an intellectual field. Not having a degree is just an odd choice.\n\nI went back to college at 28 (for IT) and was VERY wealthy when I retired at 57.\n\nThere's hope i you put some work into it. \n\nYou'll forever be competing with smarter people who have done more if you don't."

While I knew finding a job in my field abroad would be challenging, I didn't expect it to be this difficult.\n\n\nI graduated as a Light Industry Engineer in Hungary, specialising in Printing technologies,Packaging design and Printed media. After moving to the UK in 2020, I was so happy when I found a production role a year later at a printing company. (I only moved here because of my fianc\u00e9, I didn't want to take anyone's job.) Although I've been promoted a few times, I'm concerned about the long-term effect of this job on my health and the lack of career growth opportunities.\nI've tried to transition into roles like artworker or print estimator, but my current experience isn't enough. I've applied for entry-level positions, but I haven't had any luck. They all need 2-3 years experience in the exact role.\n\n\nI'm considering to leave the printing industry behind and change my career to the IT sector but am unsure if it's a worthwhile investment. I've started studying for the CompTIA A+ certification but  I'm worried that even with the certification, I won't find a job without experience. I have a GCSE in Informatics(from my country) so I have a basic knowledge of some things but I don't have any real life experience.\n\n\nI just feel like by the time I manage to get a decent job, all my eggs will be dead.

Will the certification provide me with the practical skills needed to solve everyday IT problems, or is it only gives you a clue where to start to fix the issue?\nDoes it worth to complete the course at a course center where they guarantee a job? Is it possible to get a job in your area or most likely you have to relocate?\n\n\nThank you in advance for the answers!\n",

I'm looking to transition into IT and have a couple of options available to me:\n\n1. Internal Help Desk Role (20-25/hr): I could transfer within my current company to a Help Desk role, but I have to wait 7 months \n\n2. Internal Application Support Role (75k-100k): I could try to transfer to an Application Support role within the company but it requires 2 years of Help Desk (which I don\u2019t have), and have to wait 7 months \n\n3. External Help Desk Role: I can apply to external jobs to get experience as fast as possible \n\nFor some more context I\u2019m 25 not too worried about the salary hit my primary focus is gaining exp, not much financial responsibility. I have a C.S degree, Net +, Sec + and AZ-900. I also have no IT experience. Given my current situation should I wait and apply internally or apply externally for a possibility to get experience quicker. \n\nThanks in advance. ",

I\u2019ve seen just about every opinion stated in both positive and extremely negative ways.  I\u2019ve seen countless rants about how certs alone aren\u2019t going to get you a job in IT.  \n\nJust wanted to let you know I landed a system support role before even completing A+.  This is not a brag, I want this to be encouraging to those of you yearning for that first job in IT.  Now to be fair my 1102 test is on Friday, but still.  Getting the interview(s) is the hard part.  \n\nMy third interview with this company was in person.  I sat at a long table in a conference room and was joined by 4 members on the leadership team for the IT department.  We talked about my resume(culinary management and business ownership background) and some personal details, and then moved into a test.  First they gave me some written instructions to perform in Active Directory and their ticketing system.  Then they blocked my view of the screen and remotely \u201cbroke\u201d it.  My task was to identify all that was wrong with it and fix it.  This was open book and Googling was allowed.  All four of them were also watching everything I did during all of this.  I was able to perform the necessary fixes and ended up getting a job offer from it.\n\nDon\u2019t give up.  Apply to everything, study to understand not to memorize and recite.  I look forward to seeing more exam passes and job offer postings!\n\n\nEDIT: I have been applying for about three months and have had 7 interviews.",

            "IT can be very rewarding but like everything you need a direction within IT. It is exceptionally easy to say I want to do IT with the thought toward IT salaries in your mind. But as many are pointing out here IT is not the easiest thing to break into with no experience.\n\nCan you do it definitely. Can you do it at your age? Again, an emphatic yes.\n\nTemper that with the knowledge that you are a way off from being successful though. Generally, I tell people that it will take about 5 years before you are earning a comfortable living in IT. I have been in IT professionally since 1984 and personally since 1976 so I have a fair background in the information I am spouting.\n\nTypically, you will start where everyone starts, in a help desk role making about $20/hour. Then you work that for about a year. The entire time training and upskilling yourself to break out of that garbage and move on to a job where you don't hate your life every day. As an admin once you break out of the help desk nightmare you will start to get your first tastes of better money and work. Jr admins can expect depending on your area $60-80k for a salary. You will do that for about a year as well. And then you can try to make the leap onto an Engineering team. By that time, you are in IT between 3 and 5 years and you should be closing in on $100k easily or more, **IF** you kept learning and training.\n\nNow for the not as bleak option\n\nGRC can be great, but it is part of cyber security and there are nearly zero entry level cyber roles in existence. To oversimplify it GRC is usually associated with the Chief Compliance or Chief Information Security Officers roles.\n\n-edit for clarity. I am not saying you would be a CISO or CCO but would work closely with them or on teams adjacent to them for a GRC role. It would still be an analyst or jr. analyst role.\n\n You are checking to see that the company has policies in place for a stated set of risks, that they are being followed, and are current for the company's risk profile by working with other teams for risk identification and mediation.\n\nIf you can get the role even in a junior capacity it is pretty lucrative. With many GRC people starting in a junior role at $60k and above.\n\nOr as u/sleepswithyourmom has stated with your background in education you could also look iinto being a trainer for technical certifications. With the range on that being between $75k and $120k. The biggest thing with that is it is just like education in that you can only teach to your level or below. So, you have to have the certififed trainer certification as well as the certification you want to train others on. Also, fairly lucrative but harder to start out and generally starting out with someone like CompTIA or another company type trainer you will make less than you would on your own. But steady pay and benefits sometimes wins out in that scenario.\n\nNo matter what you do take away that you CAN indeed start in IT in whatever capacity you wish. There is no worry about gender or age. There is only do you have the time, the skill, and the aptitude for what you want to do. The rest is just do the grind and you will eventually be successful.\n\nThe only other note here is that the market sucks right now but if you are prepared and work it diligently you will be fine.\n\nGood luck with it all and this sub is one of the very best on Reddit. We are always here and willing to help if we can.\n\n-edit for direction on your current path the A+ is an excellent place to start. Look up Jason Dion and Professor Messer for free courses related to A+, Network+, and Security+. That is the 'trifecta' and is the basic set of skills that CompTIA wishes its professionals to possess. With a trifecta you can work helpdesk or admin roles without too much challenge. There are other things to add in but that depends on your role. If you are more network centric a CCNA would be recommended. etc.\n\nAnd for the A+ one of the best ways to learn it is to do it. I normally recommend people build a lab. That is a couple of NUC machines from eBay for about $50 each that run Windows 10 and have 16GB of Memory with anything above 500GB for storage. SSD if you find it is better. Also, an unmanaged network switch for about $20 and a regular tower desktop machine even a couple generations old. That can be had for $50ish. This will let you do things like remove/install memory and will give you an idea of a full-size machine's motherboard layout. Servers are similar to this layout and so it also helps you be ready to move up a level from just a desktop machine later on.\n\nIn the meantime, install virtual box on the NUCs and build out a windows workstation and a Linux workstation as VMs on one. On the other you can download from Microsoft a 180-day trial edition server and set up a domain controller and set up users and join machines to it etc. To start getting familiar with AD which you will encounter on a very limited basis on your exam but a lot in real life. This will give you a lab that is capable of taking you through your entire certification path and onto more advanced ones as you progress.",
            "You have to be very realistic and specific about how you define success.  I was a teacher and bolted at 36. I decided I couldn't stand kids. Even then, I had two Comp Sci degrees.\n\nIt won't be easy. There's a lot to learn, and you'll be competing with people way younger that will do it cheaper.\n\nSo, define your success.  Even at 36, it sucked being the oldest guy at most jobs.  But, then I retired at 56, and it was a wonderful journey....",

You want to set yourself apart as being \u201cin it to win it\u201d for the long term. I would suggest you make it clear that you want to join the team and grow your skills with that company. \n\n2 You are going to bring good people skills and good customer service to the table. For me, skill and knowledge gaps can be addressed, your work ethic and attitude are much harder to fix. \n\n3 You are hungry to learn and you will be a motivated team member. I would suggest that you make it clear that the IT field is where you want to be, you are self aware that you have a lot to learn but computers are your passion and going to bring your enthusiasm every single day. \n\nBottom line if you are committed anything is possible.

Got a Bachelors in Cybersecurity, and landed a job as helpdesk at a local government, then promoted into security after passing Pentest +, CYSA+ and SSCP.\n\nI started with A+ to prove to myself I could do it. Its not an easy job by any means; I have to research every vulnerability and every solution to understand the processes. Lots of late nights, unpaid. I break stuff and have to fix it.  But I havent experienced ageism- roughly half the IT team is older, and half younger.  There are benefits to having years of experience in other fields. Customer service skills, communication, and a maturity that brings commitment to problem solving without giving up and getting the job done.\n\nIt's frustrating and fulfilling. Constantly learning. Constantly fighting the influx of vulnerabilities and the users who are accustomed to doing it their way. Its a battle. But you can see progress.\n\nI wouldnt go back.

            "IT job interviews are not like other job interviews in my experience. Employers and hiring managers generally prioritize skills and knowledge over anything. A lot of interviews are almost like a certification test. They won\u2019t ask where you see yourself in 5 years they will ask if you know how to set up a RAID array. One thing you probably have that will give you a leg up is life experience and a personality. The memes of socially awkward tech workers is moderately true. A lot of hiring managers I know will take a chance on someone motivated to learn and work that has soft skills already. Especially for an entry level position. That A+ will prove you can learn and are willing to work. \n\n\nI didn\u2019t start my IT journey until I was almost 30. I got in on an entry level job and started getting certifications and experience and worked my way up. Even got myself a bachelors degree in Network Operations now, like I\u2019m an adult or something. The woman that hired me told me afterwards she thought I was lacking tech skills but had soft skills and a will to learn. In her words, \u201cI can teach you the tech stuff, I can\u2019t teach you how to talk to people.\u201d \n\n\nAge might be a hindrance for some roles. There is a bias towards younger workers without experience than older without experience, but you can do it. \n\n\nIt is very very doable and honestly I love it. Constantly getting to learn new technology and try things. I think you can absolutely break in and get it. Just don\u2019t stop, don\u2019t give up.

In the beginning of one of the classes the professor went over the basic education track related to Networking: from A+, past Network and Security then ending in CCNA.  Unfortunately I had to travel from a longer distance that day so I'd missed most of it but I got the gist from what was on the whiteboard.\n\nAfter class I asked him about what they'd discussed while I wasn't there (and the fact that I was also in the IT field but older than all the kids in the class) and he told me that he'd seen people older than me (about your age now) start in the IT field (i.e. take classes) and reach CCNA.\n\nIt's a long road and don't expect to understand everything the first time you read about it.  Just stick with it and you'll get there.  Good luck.",

So take the skills you know you are good at as a teacher and use them as leverage for your IT field. Your focus should be on developing a technical/troubleshooting skills.

        "content": "**Edit was to add study materials/resources**\n\n9 months ago I was driving a forklift on a Wednesday, and at 10am, we had a plant wide meeting saying we would not be returning to work the next day. This morning, I woke up and went to work in my underwear in my home office.\n\nI see the question a lot on here and on IT Career questions: I am working as \\*enter job/field here\\* and want to transition to IT, can I do it? The answer is simple: YES. Yes you can.\n\nI just started to get into IT this past April of 2020. I worked at a warehouse driving a forklift around and hand unloading trailers. The company filed bankruptcy during Covid shutdowns and I was out of a Job with a pregnant fiance and a 3 year old.\n\nI started studying hard core and had my A+ by May. Got a job as a PC repair tech in June. During the time after my A+ and while working as a PC repair tech, I earned 6 other certs: Microsoft MTA Security, MTA Server, and MTA Networking, along with LPI Linux, CompTIA Server+, CompTIA Sec+, and I test for CompTIA Network+ this coming Sunday. With any luck, I will pass and have my 8th and final cert for awhile as I focus on my career and gaining experience in the workplace.\n\nTwo months ago I accepted a new position as a technical support Coordinator for a very large company that owns retail stores, and doctors offices. I support those locations working with only internal employees that staff those locations. I support the network, managing their ipads, and doctors equipment as well and host of other stuff. I absolutely love my job and this multi billion dollar company has everything internal, so my possibilities are endless.\n\nIf I can go from a nerd that was driving a forklift to working in IT, so can you. My journey was difficult, but I applied myself. Getting my first IT job was not easy. Over a month, I applied for over 100 jobs before getting a call. But every morning I woke, took my morning duce and scrolled indeed.\n\nCerts absolutely opened doors for me. Having my A+ and some microsoft certs checked the boxes for me to get past HR and into an interview where I could lobby for a position. My certs were a tool I used to get a job, you need many other factors in the interview. But the certs were absolutely a tool, and they allowed me to study and focus and force myself to learn because it gave me an end goal. Also finding a job while I added to my resume with certs was huge, it allowed me to put that knowledge into practical use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone is looking to make the jump into IT, you can.\n\nFor A+, I used Messer videos and notes, along with Mike Meyers \"All-in-One\" A+ book. \n\nFor Server+ just Mike Meyers \"All-in-One\" Server+ book and the practice exams that came with the book(it was CD) \n\nFor Security+ used Messer videos, Dions course from Udemy and Dion's test package.  \n\nCurrently studying for Net+. Using Messers videos, Mike Meyers' video course from udemy and bought Dion's practice exams to get some \"test\" reps in before sunday.  \n\nTo pass MTA Networking, I just used my Meyers video course.  \n\nFor LPI Linux, bought a linux fundamentals book and IT Pro TV free trial.  \n\nMTA Server, used the Server+ book, but brushed up on microsofts terminology and objectives.  \n\nFor MTA Security. i don't remember other than Microsofts study guide.

        "content": "Background: I\u2019ve been an IT engineer for 19 years, first as a network/system engineer, then transitioning to cybersecurity to the point where that\u2019s been my primary role the past 5-ish years. None of my jobs ever required a certification, so I had none, but decided to get my Security+ for the sake of job hunting.\n\nAfter going through some practice materials, I decided my study goal would be to just fill in the gaps on things I\u2019d need to memorize: acronym definitions, the difference between MOU/MOA/MSA, etc. Things that I\u2019ve never needed to know in the real world, and certainly wouldn\u2019t need memorized, but whatever.\n\nI skimmed 2 books, taking notes along the way on those things I didn\u2019t know off the top of my head. First was an ebook of the Mike Chapple/David Seidl Study Guide, provided by my job\u2019s ebook library. It was pretty awful, focusing on a lot of stuff that wasn\u2019t in the exam, and being plain wrong about others. (e.g. It defined perfect forward secrecy as what Tor uses to forward packets. [This is not a joke](https://imgur.com/a/37Wj8zo).) Finding that it left a lot of gaps yet to fill, my 2nd book was the official CompTIA Sec+ study guide.\n\nAfter doing a bunch of practice questions, I was feeling more confident, and it seemed that the ones I had trouble with were mostly because they were just poorly written (with some even having typos), but surely the actual test itself wouldn\u2019t be that bad, right?\n\nIt was worse than I imagined. There were so many questions where I was just baffled about what they were talking about. And not in the way of \u201cI don\u2019t understand this definition or concept\u201d, but rather in the way that the scenarios were so vague that all I could do was pick either the answer I think they wanted, or the least-bad answer. (One question even had a typo!) A lot of the questions were of the variety: \u201ca thing happened, and you\u2019ve discovered this evidence. what should you look at next?\u201d, and it\u2019s so vague that depending on the real-world context, multiple of the answers could be reasonable. I purchased a package that came with a free retake, and as I was going through, I thought to myself, \u201cif I fail, I have no idea what to even focus on, because the things that are giving me trouble are just bad questions\u201d.\n\nAnyway, I had no idea that I\u2019d get my score then and there at the end, so I was pleasantly surprised to be presented with a passing score of 805. I kinda wish they\u2019d let me review the things I got wrong, but I\u2019d probably have an aneurism over them.\n\nTLDR: Security+ is a terrible exam, and neither the study materials nor exam itself are a substitute for real world experience. I\u2019d never base hiring someone on whether they did or didn\u2019t have the certification.",

        "content": "Hey there, everyone. This is a REALLY long post, so I apologize in advance. I just feel like these questions are best to ask people with first-hand experience. Thank you for any insight.\n\nI've been strongly considering joining the military to gain experience in the field and to get my foot in the door. That being said, I have a little background, I am 30, I have a business degree, and I've been working in management roles over the last several years. I and a few coworkers were recently laid off about a month ago due to budget cuts with the company and I have had 0 luck landing another role, either they ghost me, they never reach out after the interview, never reach out in general or nothing at all happens. This has been with I would say 100s of applications. I am looking for a change career wise. I always wanted to do something with IT but never did for some reason. So I am looking at it like this is my biggest chance, and it's now or never. Is the military a good idea for this?\n\nQuestions here.\n\nWhat branch would be the best for cyber? How long are cyber contracts? Are they all 6 years in every branch?\n\nWhat branch would offer the best QoL? \nThis would more than likely only be one enlistment, so it's not something lifelong, so I understand it's the military, and I'll be in a barracks, etc. \n\nWhat branches training would be the best for cyber?\n I've read different things based on the training provided, failure rate, what happens if you fail, etc. Any first-hand experience would be very welcome.\n\nWhat would transition best to civilian life?\n I've read some branches give you alot of certs, and some don't. I've read basically all give you a clearance which alone is valuable. \n\nWhat branch would also fit my age better?\nI've heard people say to commission, but I don't have a degree in computer science or STEM, so it's not possible. I also want experience, training, and learning the field. Also, I get it. It's the military. People younger than me, older than me, etc. Again, I'm not really bothered about it. They put in the time.\n\n-So last question is there any branch that does their job more over another?\nI've read various posts where people said they learned maybe a year of experience vs. their 6 year contract. Due to being pulled away from their job, etc. \n\nThat being said, I'm only interested in IT/cyber. So I believe AirForce would be out because the chances I've read of getting it are not likely. Since it's a 1-10 or 1-15 dream sheet shot. Army, I've read you can pick. Navy, I've even read you can pick, so that's another option too.",

Which as u/Specialist_Fun_00 points out means grinding at a helpdesk for a year +/- and then getting onto an admin team internally. And IF they use Linux at the enterprise level then you can move into being a Nix admin. Otherwise you will have to cut your teeth on an enterprise admin team and start looking around for a company that has Linux at the enterprise level to move into.\n\nA ton of companies are Mickeysoft only out there. And while Linux is the largest deployed server base on the planet there are a lot of places it just doesn't fit. But the good news is that once you grind up the ladder a little bit Nix admins make tall cash. So, keep learning and grinding and in a couple years you are on a massive upward trajectory.\n\n-edit Linux+ is a great cert to have here and I love my CompTIA certs but it is NOT going to carry the same weight as the two I gave you up top here for hiring purposes. The RHCSA will get you the most traction in hiring for admins. And the LPI series you need LPIC-2 to make the jump to admin and LPIC-3 to get into a security role.

As long as you know your stuff, you can get hired.\n\nif you want to skip the helpdesk I'd strongly advise you to have many GitHub projects showing that you know every facet of the role and link to this on your CV and LinkedIn profile so recruiters know you know your stuff. they will check.",

            "8 years ago, I would have said what etaylormcp has said. Infact it's still good advice. \n\nSysadmin has changed a lot. \n\nFor instance, Sysadmins were never meant to have learned git. Now I say it's a major requirement as IAC (infrastructure as code. yep you write your infrastructure and it happens). Seriously do 3 weeks on git. \n\nTLDR.\n\nIAC: terraform/cloud formation + git. \n\nLinux: RHCSA/Linux+/LPI and the Linux + is a decent cert. \n\nWindows: something MS. MSCE is tough (not a windows admin).\n\nCloud: AWS Sysops Administrator and continue down that path. \n\n \n\nAre you Linux or Windows server orientated? Linux rocks but choose your MS + powershell path or RHCE/LPI path wisely. I have chosen Linux and no regrets.  \n\nCloud needs cloud admins. \n\nI would continue down the AWS path and be a Cloud Sysadmin. You have your Solutions Architect, get your Sysops Administrator as this is more \"sysadmin\". Understand cloud formation and then you walk into an interview saying \"I can provision 20 servers in 1 minute.\"\n\nStick with 1 cloud provider, AWS is most common followed by Azure. Yes the google cloud jobs pay more but they are very rare. \n\n  \nYes sysadmin is a good skill. Just the systems have changed from pets (keep this server running) to cattle (we have 9 webservers serving traffic, oh nr 4 died. kill it and whip up 3 more.)",
            "Takes a lot with what you have to get into the role you want. Like others have said, you normally have to start with help desk, even though help desk doesn\u2019t pay the most, it\u2019s 99% of the time a requirement to gain experience. \n\nHOWEVER, having Sec+ is a great start.

For the Linux notes, focus on the shell commands and the file permissions.\n\n**Resources used:** Dion's 6-practice tests for each exam, did each exam two to three times before attempting the respective certification test.\n\n**Total time spent on prep:** Close to two weeks total, one for each part of the test.\n\n**My background:** I'm a long time hardware nerd and enthusiast, been building custom PCs since the late 2000s. Also hold a Computer Engineering degree and a Masters in CS. Have worked as a cloud developer at Oracle for nearly 5 years. Total industry experience of 6 years.\n\nDespite the above, I was taken aback at the sheer breadth of topics covered by the A+ and actually learnt a bunch! Was definitely underestimating it going into it but came out humbled and also brushed up on many topics!\n\n**Reason for obtaining the A+ cert:** Recently immigrated to Canada, job market sucks, hoping to get a technician/help-desk gig to tide over this time but many places ask for this cert first, so thought I'd wrap it up in a couple of weeks. Also hoping to transition into cybersecurity so thought A+ and Net+ would serve as good refreshers before diving into the Sec+ and other cloud security/architect and CISSP certs.\n\nHope the notes prove helpful to folk here!

There is also FedVTE, they have training as well in IT.\n\nJobs....I was able to get my contractor job from clearancejobs. Def try USAJOBS as well. Contracting usually pays more but contracts can get yanked and expire and whatnot so its not the most stable. Going federal like a GS position you can continue your pension from your AF time and have almost guaranteed employment if you aren't a 100 percent failure at life. If you get a CTR job overseas then you pay like 1/20th federal taxes so if you are single or have a willing partner and situation I would recommend this the most.\n\nTry to use your clearance for sure, i was able to get my secret upgraded to TS/SCI\n\nDisability.....If you just got out of the AF and you havent done a BDD claim or no claim at all, submit an intent to follow by your 1 year post EAS date and you will get backpain.\n\nResume.....Use ChatGPT to make a decent resume. Don't lie but embellish yourself, get past the people looking at your resume who have no clue what the job even is.\n\nProjects for said resume....if you have time and want to do projects to actually learn the technologies you are using then do that and put those projects in your resume. Go on youtube, chatgpt, github, the oreilly stuff i mentioned has some practical stuff as well.\n\nGet your degree.....use your GI Bill, or if you already have disability over 10% use your VR&E, weird thing about degrees is it kinda depends on where you are in your career. I have experience, I have the certs, there is no need for me to go for a technical degree, so i am pursuing a management degree. You on the other hand need experience if you arent going to be leading.

IT demands you consistently learn new tech and upskill yourself. If you\u2019re someone who isn\u2019t good or has difficulty learning, you may want to look elsewhere.\n\nLastly, ask yourself if you enjoy working with people. A lot of IT is working with others which can be great but also frustrating. People are often lazy and shovel their shit to the IT department. It\u2019s also worth asking probing questions about how the IT department is prioritized at the company you are interviewing for. More often than not, IT is underfunded and disrespected. Because they are often a spend and not a revenue bringer, corners get cut and they often get the short end of the stick. This isn\u2019t all companies but most I\u2019ve been with.",
            "I believe certs are one way but maybe not the best (without adequate working experience)  \nI would say, look at what is relevant today - one area I see that is hugely in demand is AI.\n\n- Learn python and understand the usage of common libraries used for ML and AI use cases.  \n- Get a through understanding of the technology powering AI (transformers, LLMs etc) and how you can integrate them within enterprise systems in a responsible and safe manner.  \n- Look into ethical AI and what can be done to reduce biases and ensure that guardrails are put in to govern the response that is shared out to customers who consume your AI powered services. \n\nknowledge is power and although this scene has literally exploded there are many opportunities out there provided you have the right skills. So work on that.",
            "I would suggest you first grab at least sufficient knowledge, online courses and a lot of practice while doing with your current job. Along with your job find any short internships online or small IT projects or anything like that which can give you real-world practical experience in this field. Once you get sufficient course certificates, practical knowledge, hands-on and a few possible experiences, create a resume tailored specifically to IT jobs mentioning your IT skills and knowledge. Your initial switch to a new career may not pay you much but once you get enough experience and you learn consistently along with your job then, in future there is a good possibility of getting high pay.\n\nI hope this helps for you."

Nobody will hire a self taught programmer unless you have connections. If that's not the case go to a JUCO and get a two year degree.

It looks like you are working toward a degree in networking, so is that your desired career path? One thing that I see with employees that come from financial services is that they understand business much more than most IT employees. This lends nicely to working in IT business facing roles such as a business relationship manager (BRM), governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) roles, project and program management, and other similar positions. Do you want to be highly technical, or have some technology background, but focused on the business of IT?\n\nAs far as certifications are concerned, I think they are useful but not something you need before looking at new roles. I have hired and/or promoted well over 100 people in IT and cybersecurity and rarely do certifications make the difference between who gets hired or promoted over another. It is much more about attitude, knowledge, skills, abilities, desire, and cultural fit. The A+ is more about computer hardware and isn't a bad cert, but not something that you really need to focus on unless you are looking at working in a help desk or PC deployment job. If you want to go into networking, I'd look at Network+ and Security+ ahead of A+.\n\nIf you can financially afford to do it, look into getting a paid internship while you finish school so you have some job experience AND formal education.

After working in many industries in software, I am most jazzed about Financial."

I just want to get any job that I can get right now as I've been unemployed for the past 3 years.  I don't really want to go back to school but more so get the certifications or so that  I will need for now and then as I get more and more experienced, add more to my resume and knowledge.

I graduated with a degree in digital forensics but decided to switch to IT because I enjoyed the problem solving aspect of it. I work for large companies who outsource their IT such as government, emergency services, large law firms, medical practices, ect. The career was fun at first but now that hacking is so prevalent and firms love cutting costs you will have to deal with extremely stressful days/nights. I still wake up panicking thinking someone is getting hacked after a client got ransomware because the owner wanted all his partners to have full admin rights and refused to listen to our pleas and warnings. One got tricked by an email and it destroyed their network and we were up through the night for a week recovering from all the damage. The amount of places who refuse to be HIPAA compliant or use small free things like MFA because \u2018it\u2019s annoying\u2019 is horrifying. \n\nMost my friends in this industry have been switching out, I\u2019m only here bc I spent years building experience building networks and don\u2019t want to start over at a lower salary in another field. Things might be easier if you work at a large firm that takes IT/Security serious but in my experience no one takes IT security serious except for the IT department which leads to \u201cwhen\u201d not \u201cif\u201d a company experiences an incident. If you get into it I hope you have a great experience but I just wanted to warn you, if I could go back in time and stick with forensics I would be much happier."

I'm trying to get into the industry myself and based off of some things I've seen in this reddit and relate, if you jump to get certs right away you may end up with a help desk job making further education tougher because of the long hours. However you may get a help desk job with manageable hours that allows you study as well. I think getting a degree while also accumulating certs is the ideal way to go. It will make being considered for supervisory, management or non technical roles more likely.",
            "Been in I.T since 2005. Some things to consider before you take the plung. Do you handle well under pressure? The industry has changed a lot from when I started. Most companies have very diligent turnaround times for getting tickets completed. I just worked for Raytheon. Their requirements were 12 tickets a day. 6 voice-mails count as one completed ticket when trying to reach out to the end user. Many of the customers worked remote on slower wireless connections. Half the time I was either leaving voice-mails or scheduling a time with the customer at a later date. And when I was able to remote, had constant slowness issues with their software distribution center and/or having to reinstall their software center locally. And then on fridays many employees were hard to reach especially so your ticket count in the week has to make up for this. It's stuff like this that you will encounter. It's not just the job itself but the circumstances you have to consider. Best of luck.",
            "I started doing various odd jobs for local businesses that didn't have IT support while in highschool. Think stuff like installing OS, cleaning hard drives, backing up data, teaching the owners how to do certain things on PC, etc.\n\nI got an associates and soon after got a help desk job doing support for restaurants. Was not glamorous by any means, but it was exposure and because I worked nights I had ample time to learn things on my own.\n\nLeft that company after a year for another where I did basically the same job but at a hospital. Got offered a better position and better pay to go back to the old company, so did that. About a year or so later I took a project management position with the same company where I assisted in new equipment rollouts to customers. By this time I was nearing completion of my bachelor's and the only certification I had was CEH (my bachelor's is in cyber security and CEH training/cert was offered as an elective at the time). \n\nAbout 6 months or so later I finished my bachelor's but unfortunately the project was over so the entire project team was laid off. Since I had a lot of downtime in that last position I spent a lot of time doing self study. I wasn't able to afford certs because I really wasn't making much at that company.\n\nWas only unemployed for about 2 months before I was reached out to by a recruiter on LinkedIn who had come across my profile and noticed the projects and learning I did along with my BS in cyber. Got offered a job at a financial company and started out as an infrastructure/systems analyst, then a year later got shifted into a cyber role, and now 2 years later I'm leading the initiative to form a threat hunting team at the company. I've got about 7 certs under my belt now, 6 of which have been company paid.\n\nSo as far as path and certs go, the actual credential is good to have on paper, but the real thing that's going to lead to a job is soaking up a ton of knowledge and trying your best to apply it to various projects. Even if it's literally just something like \"I read about this thing so I practiced it at home on a 8 year old computer and here's how it went\". Start a blog, keep track of projects and what you've learned, post on LinkedIn. As long as you're constantly learning, you're going down the right path",

I\u2019ve been through some stuff as well.\n\nIn terms of a career change, I\u2019d first ask the question of what you want to be doing 5 or 10 years from now (where do you see yourself in the future because you don\u2019t want to get a new career and then hate it after). However, let\u2019s assume that you want to get into the I.T field (which is a career in where you don\u2019t need a degree to make a great living). The next step would to identity what are the steps to get there. A second bachelors would be a good idea as you would be more qualified and gives you a more options, however, you don\u2019t want to be \u201cover educated\u201d with zero experience in the given field you want to go in. Plus, I\u2019ve seen many self taught software devs and people in the I.T world who never had a degree and or step foot on a college campus and got jobs a Fortune 500 companies. I think in your case however, certifications would be a good idea as they would be less costly and can give you some great knowledge and skills. Some really good resources are as followed:\n\n- Coursera: really good place to get certificates and online degrees and have partnerships with over 200 companies and universities. Just use the search bar to find any course or specialization you like:\n\nhttps://www.coursera.org\n\n- Microsoft Certifications: Also really good and are official certifications that are marketable and high quality:\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/\n\n- Udemy: This platform offers really good courses that are high quality on whatever skills you\u2019d like to learn.\n\nhttps://www.udemy.com\n\n - FreeCodeCamp: basically a CS degree on YouTube (you can learn a lot of programming / frameworks from them):\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp/videos\n\nhttps://www.freecodecamp.org\n\nFrom there, I\u2019d just focus on having / building really good side projects that employers will love, building out a really good resume, and adding any experience you have (e.g. the insurance company). \n\nYou got this and good luck!",

            "I received a BS in Microbiology and worked in the public sector and made a change in early 2019 (I've been in IT almost 2 years now). I think since you are more senior in your insurance position you will definitely take a pay cut to switch professions, but better mental health might be the trade off!\n\nI personally sought out an AAS (Applied Associates of Science) program and have earned many IT certs since starting. Your first BS should check HR boxes, so it's really up to you to pursue an entirely different BS/MS. Before starting IT I did 2 semesters of a Oregon States Post Bacc Computer Science program and hated every second. For one, the online classes pack 250+ students in them and you are taught via YouTube by an18 year old TA. Second, the program would have been about $60,000 at the rate I would have gone and worked at my IT job...not very realistic.  The lack of IT professionals in my area resulted in me getting a pretty decent position since there was low competition. Finding a local Community College (that's all online), I transferred all of my Bachelors courses, and just had to take the IT courses/certs. I have gotten massive raises since getting the certs to what I was making in the public sector.\n\nThe certs included in my program are A+, Security+, Linux+, server+, MCP (going away January 2021), Pentest+, CEH, CCNA. Each class essentially prepares you for cert, and while I haven't taken all of them yet, I thankfully haven't failed one either.",

If so, certifications are the way to go, especially if you have any degree already. If you want the MS, I can personally say that no one will have much trouble getting an Online MS IT from MGA in about a year; and it\u2019s fully regionally accredited.",

            "Moving into IT with no professional experience in the field is a little tough, but it's absolutely possible and all depends on your own motivation and drive. Since you had a higher-level sounding position, you may have a different and easier experience than I did. I worked in customer service, then security, and my last job before getting into IT was as a bank teller. Bottom barrel stuff. I've only been in IT for 3 months but it's been life changing for me. I have a really cushy job, great benefits, and am learning so so much; and I'm just a helpdesk tech.\n\nHere's the challenges with IT jobs:\n\n\\- Most of them require experience, education, a combination of the two, or one or the other. Some require specialized certifications.\n\n\\- Getting in entry level doesn't pay very well at all, and getting in entry level is sometimes the only way to get your foot in the door.\n\n\\- Higher level IT jobs require specialization, degrees, and experience.\n\n\\- You can be worth way more to your employer than they're paying you, and you might not know it.\n\nHere's how you get around those hurdles:\n\n\\- Apply for it anyway. Does the job require 10 years of experience? Apply anyway. You could end up being in the right place at the right time.\n\n\\- Dust your resume off and remake it. Show relevant work experience and detail anything tech-related you might have done, even if it wasn't in the job description. Did you help Bill in Finance get his printer working one time? Guess what, you have professional experience troubleshooting printers now! (Of course, don't overelaborate or lie). You're now going into a field where there are dramatically fewer applicants, so your resume will be looked at by a human and not an algorithm. Google Docs has a few great professional resume templates for free.\n\n\\- Sincerely show your passion. Employers want you to be passionate about your skills, and lack of passion will be etched all over your face. If you're not passionate about the technology you're working with, you won't enjoy the field, and you'll dip out. (Protip: If you lose your passion while deep in an IT career, it's time to change employers or specializations).\n\n\\- Get some certifications. Going through a CompTIA A+ course will help you determine if you even want to enter IT, and then having some basic certifications will pad your resume. Once you get hired, I'd argue certifications are pointless after that, but they are critical to getting your foot in the door. Specialized certifications are way more useful.\n\n\\- Do research and find out what technologies are slowly dying and avoid specializing in them. Cloud is the future and it's here now, FYI.\n\n\\- Ask yourself what you want to do and find what you're actually passionate about. Saying \"I want to work in IT\" is like saying \"I want to see what's in the ocean.\" But what do you want to see specifically once you're in the water? Find a field of IT that excites you, then find a specific specialization that's going to make you excited, and start focusing on it. I started out wanting to become a cybersecurity analyst, but after doing more research, talking to mentors and colleagues, and soul-searching, I discovered I have a huge fascination with manipulating data, and now my target role is eventually a Database Administrator, and I'm focusing on mastering specific skills that will someday get me there, so I'm teaching myself SQL and Python.\n\n\\- Make a side project and showcase it. Know how to code? Make a program, record yourself showcasing it, and include that with application materials. Make a homelab with virtual machines. Hack your home network. Record the work you're doing that showcases your skills as a presentation or tutorial and include it. A good employer would go nuts over that.\n\n\\- Start networking. The world of IT is about who you know, not what you know.\n\nGood luck, but you won't need luck because it all boils down to YOU and what efforts you're willing to put in. You WILL put in literally hundreds of applications, and you WILL get literally hundreds of rejections; but take the first job you're offered, even if you don't really want it, because it's far easier to move up and hop around while working in IT than it is getting into it.\n\nThe biggest advice I've gotten, and wish I'd listened to earlier, is find what you're passionate about and SPECIALIZE in it. Become a master of your craft; and once you do and start proving it, you'll have recruiters beating down your door begging you to take their money and work for them.",

            "The short answer is you can\u2019t without the proper certifications.  Even if you had them, it would be a steep hill to climb without IT experience on your resume.  Lately the competition has been tough.\n\nI just left a position in October 2024, as a DA Civilian in the 2210 series, after three years (Term position).  Prior to that, I worked IT contracting jobs for 8 years supporting the U.S. DOD in various IT positions, including a lead contractor position which required me to interview potential hires.\n\nFirst off, you need to read the requirements in DOD regulations 8750.  Some companies might hire you and give you six months to get your CompTIA Security +, but they won\u2019t even look at you without experience.  If applying for a Help Desk position and the company is desperate, they might consider you, but that\u2019s unlikely without having Security +.  \n\nMy advice is to either study on your own and watch videos like Professor Messer to prepare for the Security+ exam and familiarize yourself with IT concepts or take classes in basic IT while still working in your current position.  Once you get a basic understanding of IT and you still want to pursue the career, volunteer to get experience while still in your current employment.  It will look good on your resume for knowing how to manage your time and for getting experience.  \n\nYes, the clearance is a requirement, but without the certification and the basic IT experience, no contracting company is going to consider you and a DA position at this time is out of the question.  You can substitute experience with formal IT training, but it\u2019s one or the other, which it sounds like you don\u2019t have either at this time.  Once you do get the basic experience some companies may hire and be willing to train on their systems or how they run a Help Desk, but you really need certifications these days to be competitive get your foot in the door for a U.S. government IT position.",
            "You're in a strong position with the TS. Get a couple certs and profit.",
            "Depends what you're planning on doing and what your current job is.\n\nMy own suggestion would be to take some courses and get a certification in basic IT practices, DevOps, or Security. Show that you've got the basic skills and have put some time in. Then you can leverage that with your clearance to get a position with a contractor or another group that needs or benefits from clearance - there's a good chance they'll be able to train you if you can show that you've got the aptitude, connections, and clearance to do the job even if you don't have all the knowledge yet.",

Once you get a job, figure out where you want to go and start studying for more certs on the side. How long it will take you to move up depends on how quickly you learn, how resourceful you are, where you want to go and where you happen to find work. Aim for small to medium size businesses, as it will help you get more varied experience. At larger companies, you can easily get stuck doing the same stuff over and over as the workload requires hiring of separate positions/teams to handle specific tasks.",

You will be a good fit giving that you have the knowledge and certificates. In tech sales you will have exposure to big projects and you will learn plenty of stuff.

You can be a business analyst that works with Salesforce, a PM that works with Salesforce, transition into admin/dev/etc. All of those are open to you. While you can use certifications to help get into these roles, experience is really what will get you there. But none of those are \"modules.\" Do you by chance mean one of the various products? Again, that's dependent on many factors. What cloud is used may have a lot to do with industry. So if you want to work in nonprofit, you focus on nonprofit. If you want to work in communications, you focus on that. But there are no \"modules\" in Salesforce."

You can't sit at home with a hot pack and still get work done.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm transitioning careers for a number of reasons, but a huge one is sustainability. My body physically is suffering from 13 hour, overnight shifts, hauling heavy dogs, etc. One bad bite or fall and I could be out of this field almost entirely (very few remote options). I'm choosing a field that I can do until I cognitively cannot anymore, and that is somewhat disability proof. I caution you to think of your whole life, and not just this moment, and be savvy with your choices. Look around on job specific subs, connect with your friend's brother who is a respiratory therapist, or your neighbor who is an ICU nurse. Be practical and critical with your choices ...and good luck, most of all. I hope something fulfilling comes to you.\u00a0",

I still do some CPA-ing to feed the fam while the other work I just reinvest everything into that endeavor.  I didn't really see any sense for me in the option financially of going back to school just to come out the other side at entry level, so I went the DIY build a business route.  Fortunately as office drones tend to do, I had some hobbies that I enjoyed extensively, which actually prepared me for this second career.\n\nIt's the struggle of my life trying to pull this off, financially taking a hit for sure, but so much more fulfilling.  I wish I did something about it 10 years ago.

Pursue things outside of work that you enjoy or always wanted to pursue. I rely heavily on a range of hobbies for fulfillment because I relied on my job for fulfillment and never found it.\n\nIn your case you hate the isolation of your career and if that is negatively affecting you then changing to something with more social interaction would be beneficial but please don't convince yourself that it will be any less boring once it becomes your normal.\n\nGood luck!",

It really comes down to what you value\u2014do you live to work, or work to live?

How do you want to spend the other two-thirds? If you\u2019re thinking about a career change, make sure to do thorough research. Nursing, for example, has its own set of challenges. Another option is to work in IT for a nonprofit organisation.

Now, I run the IT department. \n\nAs far as purpose. You got to find your own meaning in the situation you're in. Finding another job might do that, or you might end up in the same mindset in just a different role.\n\nPersonally, I find purpose in my job even now because I know what I do has a direct impact on how people are getting paid at my job. If a certain app isn't running, people aren't getting paid, and with most people in the world living paycheck to paycheck, I feel obligated to make sure these folks are getting the money they deserve to support their families. \n\nBut I understand your sentiment.

            "As someone who made a career change at 31 with a MBA, here\u2019s my advice. Take it with however many grains of salt you need.\n\nA MBA is not a magic bullet to a new industry. It can happen, but it\u2019s not that easy. Most people move into adjacent industries or consulting.\n\nIt\u2019s really only useful to get your foot in the door at another company or to check a box with your current company. That being said, you seem like you\u2019re definitely on your way out at your current company so definitely do not get one for them.\n\nIf you decide to go back to school. Make sure you have a plan on what you want to do, ie: consulting, finance, etc\u2026 pick a lane and stay in it.\n\nThe most important parts of a MBA are the name of the school and the networking it affords. It does not have to be a top 5 school if the name is important in your area. For example: A Georgia Tech degree in Atlanta is as good or better than an Ivy League degree because most of the major players in Atlanta have GT degrees and the school works hard to get those companies into their networking. Networking becomes your full time job. You need to talk to as many people as you can to help get a feel for what you want to do and how to get there. These people will also help you get your foot in the door.\n\nDon\u2019t go into a MBA hoping it will solve your problems. The people in my cohort who had no plan stayed with the current companies and really haven\u2019t thrived. The people who went in with a plan got hired in big consulting firms, major industry players and FAANGs.",

He went ballistic that he didn't even get 10% more.\n\nHe quit and took a non-managerial job somewhere else.\n\nIt does seem like an MBA from a very select program is worth it, from my limited experience around them.\n\nGood sales people seem to be a different breed of people. You need to be motivated by money or \"success\" over most everything else to be good at it. It doesn't mean that you only have to care about money, but you have to be driven to be good at it.

We have been brainwashed as a generation that if we just got that bachelors degree or that MBA, our life would be set up for success and get a great job. \n\nUm no. Just think back to your own experience getting a bachelors. Did all these amazing options open up because of a college degree? \n\nIronically the intention to get more people educated created an unintended consequence. What happens when a lot of people get degrees, including graduate ones like MBA etc ? \n\nThe degrees become commodified and don\u2019t make you stand out. Universities are just for profit entities that are like diploma mills. They don\u2019t care what happens to the students - they just want to churn out as many graduates and students as possible. \n\nAnd if you don\u2019t believe me, ironically you should do some market research on MBA graduates. \n\nThis is one of the #1 key issues I have with telling people to get a bachelors or MBA. They just blindly go into it because they were told it would lead to these jobs. \n\nBut they don\u2019t do their own research and then find out afterwards it doesn\u2019t get them what they want at all. \n\nFind and conduct some informational interviews from people who have graduated with MBAs and see if they got that lucrative job because of the MBA or because of other reasons like prior experience in other fields.\n\n\nNow, to answer your question, I would say sales is the most realistic option because it doesn\u2019t require a degree and you can get started the fastest. \n\nB2b sales would probably be the best for money but b2C can also be lucrative. Look into those industries and learn more about sales. \n\nStarting a business with no idea is a a terrible plan. You don\u2019t start a business to make money. You start a business to solve customers\u2019 problems. \n\nYou need to understand the MARKET and see what\u2019s in demand or could be in demand.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know how to do sales, I wouldn\u2019t even bother with starting a business because that is so crucial and vital.",

Where do I want to be in 5 years? And is an MBA the most efficient path to get there.  \n\nThat\u2019s a tough question to answer all at once. I approached it by writing down a list of the aspects and skills of my current role that I liked and disliked. Do you like selling you, your companies products, or your work to other people? Then Sales or Consulting could make sense. Important to remember Consulting and Banking at their core are sophisticated sales jobs. The path to \u201cselling\u201d is much shorter post MBA. If you enjoy being buried in a model, the technical side of things, then maybe a data role is more up your alley. I\u2019m not an expert in that world though. To me seems like an area that could get gobbled up by AI relatively quickly.  \n\nThe people who get in trouble in my program (I.e. graduated without jobs or were unable to switch industries) were people who didn\u2019t plan effectively coming in. They expected to head to school and figure it out when they got there. That put them behind the curve. You have to come to campus with some idea of what you want and how an MBA can get you there.  \n\nThere are 2 lessor known bits of info on MBAs that can change the calculus on being \u201cworth it\u201d. First is the power of regional schools. I wanted to end up in Chicago. I did my MBA at a state school in the Midwest that was ranked in the top 30 or so. I had a ton of great job offers in Chicago. I\u2019m not sure going to Duke would have really moved the needle much unless I needed to be at MBB. Second piece of info is many schools give scholarships.

At least when I was 30, it was for me. 30 is a tough age career wise, because you feel like you\u2019re supposed to have your path figured out by now. You largely identify yourself by what you do for a living. You started going to school when you were 4 years old with the purpose of getting a good job. But now that you\u2019re there, it\u2019s unfulfilling and you can\u2019t imagine doing what you\u2019re doing for 30 more years without blowing your brains out.\u00a0\n\nI was a Business Analyat until I was 30 and was in a similar mental space as you are now.

            "I wish I could go back in time and tell EVERY mother who is considering leaving the workforce: \n\nStart an LLC and be the Primary Owner on the paperwork. She does have 5 years of work experience. Want me to translate the skills? \n\nThere was no gap in work. That\u2019s a myth doin all us parents dirty tbh. She kept your children ALIVE! And through a worldwide pandemic no less! Get some perspective? \n\nSome other commenters are correct. You are looking at this wrong. She probably only has low self-esteem because she gets zero positive feedback for her efforts. \n\nAre you building your wife up? You are her co-worker. What have you done for her lately to show your appreciation and respect and admiration? \n\nShe gave you children. She handed you meals. She made it possible for you to have your career. Now it\u2019s time to give back and pour your love and encouragement into her. \n\nTemp Agencies are really the way to go here. \nThat plus a few edX classes in Excel? \nShe\u2019ll be fine. \n\nAI generated this content below. Even without an LLC backing her up? It\u2019s still Resume applicable. No gaps in parent land. \n\nThis is how you lift her up! Show her what a badass she is for doing the hard core labor of raising humans! Did you buy a home during this time? Did you move? Did the kids start school? Does she help with homework? \n\nAI can translate the past 5 years into Business Language of every single thing you two have done since leaving the \u201cworkforce\u201d. And she can put SOLE OWNER - Stay@Home Mom Inc on her Resume. \n\nHere\u2019s how the duties of a stay-at-home mom can be translated into business language suitable for a resume:\n\nDaily Operations Management:\n\t\u2022\tOversaw household operations, including scheduling, resource allocation, and conflict resolution.\n\t\u2022\tDelivered personalized care and education to dependents, ensuring developmental milestones were met.\n\t\u2022\tManaged meal planning, preparation, and nutritional oversight, balancing budget constraints and dietary requirements.\n\t\u2022\tMaintained a clean, safe, and organized living environment to optimize productivity and comfort for all household members.\n\nWeekly Strategic Coordination:\n\t\u2022\tDeveloped and executed activity schedules, balancing extracurricular engagements, educational goals, and family priorities.\n\t\u2022\tConducted procurement activities, managing household inventory and ensuring cost-effective purchasing decisions.\n\t\u2022\tProvided logistical support, coordinating transportation, appointments, and event planning.\n\t\u2022\tMonitored and adjusted budget expenditures, ensuring financial objectives were met.\n\nAnnual Planning and Growth Initiatives:\n\t\u2022\tPlanned and executed large-scale projects, including family vacations, home improvement initiatives, and educational transitions.\n\t\u2022\tImplemented long-term developmental strategies, fostering academic and social growth in dependents.\n\t\u2022\tConducted performance reviews (e.g., school progress, skill development), identifying opportunities for improvement and success.\n\t\u2022\tBuilt and maintained relationships with external stakeholders, including educators, healthcare professionals, and community networks.\n\nThis description emphasizes transferable skills such as leadership, organization, financial management, and strategic planning. \n\n^^ that is the confidence building you can give her. She has been there for you. Be there and show her what she\u2019s accomplished. Make a 5 year Certificate of Achievement! Build her up!\n\nEdit: all employers want to see is that you have dedicated yourself to SOMETHING! She did that. \nAsk AI for help to show her just how much work she really did. You know what you two have been through. I don\u2019t. Add it to the prompt if you moved and she coordinated it. Or whatever else has gone on the past 5 years. Motherhood pay = $200k a year - if you were to farm it out to others. \n\nEmployers know this. They just want someone that can fill the gaps, and be creative using their intellect. Yep. \n\nPrompt used to my trained AI: Can you give me a stay at home mom\u2019s equivalent duties per day, week, and year described in business language for a Resume?\n\nI was a hiring manager. I speak from deep experience and knowledge of what a CEO wants. I communicated with them near daily at times. \nA mother does not carry the same stigma it used to when hiring. Get that out of your heads. It\u2019s an outdated bias. We hire single mothers all the time. We hire people. Can they work the hours and not upset corporate? (By dropping our bottom line below set targets?) All we care about tbh. Become a \u201cvalue added\u201d known employee and advocate, and you will rise the ranks, if you want that. \n\nNearly everything can be negotiated. If you know how to speak up for yourself. Gotta master that. And the right people are key to turning open new doors. Those doors can be found at: \n\nProfessional Networking Groups \n- they brainstorm and help people from within. Join a few! Find your people. \n\nHiding in plain sight are Hiring staff and Recruiters. Talent Scouting 100% happens at networking events.You do not have to be currently employed to attend. Just be confident in what you are striving for. Know what you are capable of. I\u2019ll make a post about it all soon. \n\nFun fact: Scouting and networking also exists on Reddit too. Yep. Sometime a Corp must patch a hole by poaching. Linked In is a mess. I\u2019ve looked here before to hire someone for a niche industry company, and I get a Finder\u2019s Fee if they match. Easy work once you ride the Corp hell train all the way to Consulting. \n\nTrust your own achievements. ALL of them. \n\nBuild yourself up! Start charting your daily accomplishments (in business language) where YOU solution solved, and you\u2019ll find hidden gems that can land you a better job than what you have. Use AI to help you learn more about Business Language speak. Step by step. Chart it. Find your talents through your daily routines. \n\nIt is a CONfidence game. Applying & Interviews. Practice speaking Business Language at home and you\u2019ll excel in the workforce! Praise yourself if no one else is. You deserve it! Always.",

It's nice when he says it, does chores without me asking for help, little things like that to take off the mental load.

I got laid off at 9 months pregnant (no joke, it was awful), and temp jobs after my son was born were so helpful. Now that he's a toddler, I've been forced into the stay at home camp. But temp jobs were awesome. Honestly, I might just go back to temping when my son gets past the toddler phase. \n\nGood luck to her. It's a hard one to get right, but she is doing her best. \n\nSeriously though, it might not be Disney, but get the kids out of the house and go do something fun in your town or nearby. You'll miss the kids, but getting away from the house is just so much better. As a surprise, hire a maid service while you're gone, so she comes back to a clean house. One less thing to worry about. I think getting a job while having the weight of the default parent is a bit stifling. So perhaps lower your expectations. You'd be surprised at how much fun date night can be at a local restaurant.\n\nGood luck to both of you. Parenting and being your individual self is so hard at the same time.

I'm facing the fact I'll never have a job I actually enjoy going into AND that enjoys me coming in AND pays my bills. I'm facing the fact that I should have never tried to find a job for personal fulfillment, just something to fulfill my bank account and retirement.\nI have to ask myself why/how I grew up thinking it was feasible to find a meaningful job I could love that paid well. I'm pretty sure it's because teachers used to tell us it was better to be poor and happy than rich and miserable. But that is a very privileged and unrealistic attitude. They showed us charts of how a college degree, by default, will pay more than not having one, so it doesn't matter what you get a degree in, just go get one.\u00a0 I had it my head that anyplace I spend a minimum of 40 hours a week at would be the center of my life, how I define myself and who I am. That the only measure of success is how much you're willing to give your employer. I wish I had been raised that work is something you have to do, do not make it the center of your life and do not define yourself by it, don't kill yourself or relationships for it. Do not put coworkers on the level of family, do not put them before your personal friends. Do not think of your boss as your God, with supreme authority over your life. Do not plan for life around a job. I wish I had learned to keep my work life in a little box that I only opened while I was there. But I grew up with this family and culture that put your job first. That whatever work needs, you do whatever it takes to make them happy, no matter how miserable it makes you or your family. That you have no right to personal-work boundaries. So you better at least enjoy the actual work, because that's all you have control over.\nSlavery. Employment is just slavery. The attitude is that an employee is a slave. We haven't even had 40 hour week weeks as the law for 100 years yet, in the US. We don't have federal legal requirements for paid sick leave, even.\u00a0\nI grew up with a dad that went to work every day, no matter what. Unless he was sick enough to go to the hospital, he went to work sick. He worked overtime every time it was an option. He cashed out vacation time instead of taking it because they were always behind on work and he wanted to be a \"good\" employee. He believed his loyalty and dedication and never complaining meant something. It did not. He didn't get raises. He didn't get promotions. He was there 40 years. In the same position. And when he was getting too old and slowed down a little, they wrote him up everyday until they had enough documentation to fire him.\nMy dad hated that job. My entire childhood, he was too tired and in a bad mood every day he came home from work. Then on weekends he was too tired to do much with us, and too stressed about going back to work to be involved with us.\u00a0\nAnd now I find myself in the same situation with my own kids. But I'm a single parent, so it's even worse for my kids. They don't have another parent sitting at home all day waiting to wait on them, like I did. No parent anxious and eager to get out the house for the weekend and do something. Instead, I come home thinking out l about how I was shit on all day, wondering how I'll pay my rent if I get canned for not picking up enough extra shifts. Or how pissed I am that I got blamed for a mistake I didn't make and couldn't prove it. Or how the girl in the cubicle across from me spends the entire day on her phone texting and Facebooking and watching TikTok because she knows the rest of us will get the work out. And being physically exhausted at 45 years old, but I have to keep working until my 70's to qualify for a meager Social Security stipend. And I'm missing my children's childhood.\u00a0\nI thought about that a lot when I was a preschool teacher. I was not allowed to have my own kids there because I couldn't afford it and they were afraid of favoritism. So I spent more awake time with other people's kids than my own, and more than their own parents spent with them.\u00a0 And I used to think if these wealthy families would just give up so much luxury, one parent could just stay home with their kids, instead of shelling out $1k+/month on tuition for each kid. In fact, most said they were only having one kid because they couldn't afford to have two kids in childcare. Okay, well you don't need this years Mercedes. You could get by with a 10 year old Kia, you know. You don't need to live in a gated community, or even a single family home at all. You could *GASP* rent an *FAINTS* apartment!\nI've come to the conclusion if you aren't the plantation owner, you are not an equal human. You are just another piece of property. Indentured slavery to prove you've earned the privilege to wake up every day.\nI'm sick of playing this game, but I can't exactly just refuse. It's hopeless, imo. I hate this life.",

            "You can do whatever you want, but transitioning won't be easy, especially if you have no medical field experience. Transitioning from a remote job to nursing is challenging. I work in a large hospital system and took two years to decide to pursue nursing which is incredibly physically demanding; I walk 24,000 steps a day going building to building, and nurses can easily cover similar distances in their shifts caring for patients on a single floor.\n\nIn California, nursing programs are highly competitive due to laws and pay. An associate's degree alone might not suffice; you'd still need a bachelor's within a certain timeframe. Nursing programs are rigorous, and clinical requirements often demand a flexible schedule. Many turn to jobs like CNA or bartending, or take out loans.\n\nThe medical field, especially patient-facing roles, can lead to burnout. With recent tech layoffs, more people might consider healthcare, but these fields are quite different and if a bunch of you come over it\u2019s going to be over saturated, which means it won\u2019t be financially lucrative if that\u2019s your goal, you can make a lot more in your current field plus you\u2019re already making six figures fully remote, the grass is not greener. I suggest leveraging your IT background in a hospital setting if you still want the job security because it will be less demanding compared to startups or tech companies.\n\nUnless you're ready to handle all bodily fluids, deal with both physical and verbal assaults from patients, clean deceased patients, and place them in mortuary bags, nursing might not be the escape from burnout you're seeking. This is what CNAs do at bedside for around $15 an hour. As a nurse, you'd have to handle these tasks, plus fulfill the technical and critical duties expected of a nurse. You could become a nurse in an office setting working 9-5, 5 days a week instead of the three twelves but the salary will not be what bedside nursing pays. Look at IT or maybe consider radiology.",

But maybe as few as 5 for the unit. If you're short staffed they might borrow a nurse from somewhere else who is probably competent but won't know the specifics of these patients etc. None of the patients want to be here 1/2 are bearable, 1/4 are making it work, 1/4 are downright unpleasant at all times.\n\nAfter hand off from the night team and report, your job is to make sure every patient has food, water, medicine - oh shit someone just thew up on themselves... where were you? right - medicine, three patients need transfers for scans downstairs at the same tim- Doc wants to talk to you about 6b they need an updated medicine regime- ok now your transfers are late but you're working on it. 12 is getting aggressive again and you have to subdue them while someone else calls security. Now it's lunch time (for the patients not for you) so it's time to hand out meal-code was just called on the next unit over all hands on deck, patient is rushed down to ER for triage and care. Now half your patients are upset because they haven't had lunch yet. But 6a needs their foley catheter assessed, looks like it's bypassing material and the patient is a royal mess. Guess who gets to smell like shit all day now - it's you. Just when you think you have five minutes to scarf down the sandwich you brought for lunch bed 2 is complaining about extreme pain and an allergic reaction at the same time you need to dispense medicine for them - what painkillers can they have again?\n\nThen at the end of your 12 hour shift you have to fill in missing charts for the patients you couldn't get to earlier, hand off to the night shift, finally eat your sandwich. You walked 12km today without going outside. Oh and that patient in the next unit died.\n\nNo thanks, I'll pound on a keyboard all day.

Most of us would call you crazy to your face. \n\n\n\u201cPlenty of opportunity for overtime\u201d can easily become \u201cmandatory overtime\u201d. Nothing like working 12 hours straight, sittting for 15 minutes combined that whole time, and being told you\u2019re working overtime because your unit is short. Oh you\u2019re a parent? Tough shit. Pay here isn\u2019t capped by market force, it\u2019s capped by Union contract. We have to  threaten to strike every two to four years just to get modest cost of living increases. My hospital will pay $1500 annually for tuition reimbursement, so they\u201dll pay for your other degrees if you\u2019re willing to take 15 years lol.. Kaiser Permanente in my state pays an annual maximum of $3000 for tuition, and they are considered a company that actually still has \u201cgood\u201d benefits in this industry, where dwindling benefits are rampant . New hires earn 4.6 hours of PTO for the first five years of employment. That\u2019s less than one shift per month. And when you get sick, it comes out of PTO, we don\u2019t have sick time. Hospitals run 24/7/365 so say bye bye to most holidays.. \n\n\n For context I\u2019m actively trying to trade the job security of healthcare for a field where I (might be) able to actually stay home for the night once I get there. I\u2019m almost halfway to a software engineering degree and I\u2019m gonna try and get into tech, regardless of how bleak it may be at the moment. It\u2019s for this reason that I truly empathize with you, because despite it being a role reversal, I\u2019m doing exactly what you\u2019re talking about. Every single waking moment that isn\u2019t work or parenting is spent trying to learn something new and study. It\u2019s exhausting, but the Hopium that it could be better is what keeps me going. \n\n\nBy all means go back to school and give nursing a shot if you think it will make you happy, you might be right. You\u2019ll almost certainly burn out eventually there because it\u2019s a hard job and we see death every day, but along the way you may find some real fulfillment. Just please don\u2019t quit your day job until you know",

It\u2019s also not a complete cakewalk (though it\u2019s not medical school, and if you have average intelligence and a good work ethic you\u2019ll be fine). It isn\u2019t always well respected compared to other jobs in healthcare which can be frustrating. Like anywhere, there *can* be drama and internal politics (and probably will be, they say nurses eat their young for a reason. You may experience this less as a man though, honestly). Obviously hours are long (though not longer than a lot of jobs. I feel like that\u2019s over dramatized a bit. It\u2019s not an 8 hour day but it\u2019s not the worst.) and obviously you\u2019re dealing with very stressed and unwell people + worried families so that has unique challenges. For a lot of people, this under-appreciation from the people you are helping combined with feelings of not mattering as much in the overall structure of healthcare makes them feel under valued from all sides\u2026and that can really do a number on you. Like any career- it can get draining. Don\u2019t romanticize it and don\u2019t go into it if the only appeal is money. Know what you\u2019re getting into, and expect to earn your pay. You don\u2019t make that kind of cash with an associates degree without a level of trade-off. \n\nTBH though, Many people romanticize working from home and tech and severely underestimate the burn out. Do something different if you want. \nBut if you\u2019re interested in healthcare and you like more than the money, it might be worth the change. \n\nI\u2019ll probably get downvoted to hell for suggesting nursing is just a job.

She used to enjoy doing the work, but feels like the travel is finally getting to her and taking too much time away from the kids. She has been at two companies, filling the same type of role with travel usually occurring multiple times a week within the tristate area, but sometimes even a few states away. \n\nI only have so much advice to offer, which is basically parroted from my mentor: finish your degree, seek out a mentor, try applying for roles you don\u2019t 100% feel qualified for. \n\nWhenever we talk about it, she gets very emotional because she feels like any other job she is qualified for at this time, will pay her significantly less than what she\u2019s making now (think, a cut of $30k or more).\n\nShe has considered continuing her education but doesn\u2019t know what type of degree to pursue to make any kind of career pivot that wouldn\u2019t set her back X amount of years. \n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t think she needs to pivot out of her industry. She loves working with eyes but doesn\u2019t know what else she can do to grow in her career and earn a higher salary, short of pursuing a medical degree, which she doesn\u2019t want to do anyway. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s a long shot, but I\u2019m hoping someone here has some better advice than the boilerplate \u201cfinish your degree, seek a mentor, etc.\u201d suggestions that I\u2019ve made to her.

It might be that the time is worth the 30k reduction in pay, it might not. Only she can answer that.",

        "content": "Hi everyone, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on this. No one has been able to give me a perspective that makes this decision any easier\u2014not even ChatGPT!\n\n**Background:**  \nMy dream career title is Chief Sustainability Officer and I have been working toward that for years now. I have a BS in Environmental Sustainability and recently earned a Master's in Environmental Analytics (focused on ESG, CSR, and climate data analysis). I've always been passionate about sustainability, conservation, and risk management projects, and I've been actively pursuing roles like ESG analyst, sustainability PM, or strategy consultant.\n\nCurrently, I work at a nonprofit as a Program Manager, focusing on data analysis and program strategy. I took this job while pursuing my master\u2019s for flexibility, but it pays $80K with minimal benefits.\n\nBefore this, I worked as a Customer Success Manager (CSM) at a cybersecurity company. It wasn\u2019t what I expected for my career path, but I enjoyed the technical aspects, risk-related work, and client management.\n\n**The Situation:**  \nRecently, I reached out to my former manager (who I *loved* working with) to ask if she\u2019d be a reference for my job applications. It turns out she\u2019s now at a new cybersecurity company, building a CSM team, and she asked me to apply. After a few interviews, I was offered the position at $130,000 with 100% paid health insurance, stock and unlimited PTO.\n\nNow I\u2019m torn.\n\n**The Pros:**\n\n* **Huge salary increase:** It\u2019s nearly double my current pay, which would help me save, pay off student loans, and live comfortably in a new city. (Relocating to NY)\n* **Great manager:** She\u2019s truly one of the best managers I\u2019ve had and cares about my growth and success.\n* **Competence:** I know I\u2019m good at CSM work, and I find cybersecurity and AI interesting, especially as someone without a strong tech background. These industries seem to be growing and have cool potential.\n* **It\u2019s an opportunity:** I\u2019ve been applying for sustainability-focused roles for months without a single interview, so it feels like a win to have an offer in hand.\n\n**The Cons:**\n\n* **Not aligned with my career goals:** This isn\u2019t the role I envisioned after earning my master\u2019s. I want to work in sustainability, risk management, and reporting.\n* **Postponed goals:** Taking this job means delaying my transition into a sustainability-focused role for at least a year.\n* **Potential for job hoping:** I always envisioned my next move as a permanent position, ideally 5 years or more. When I think about doing this role for 5 years, I'm not jazzed.\n* **Limited advancement:** CSM roles don\u2019t offer many growth opportunities unless I go into VP-level customer success, which doesn\u2019t align with my interests.\n* **Commitment concerns:** I\u2019d feel guilty leaving this role (and my manager) if my dream sustainability job came along soon. I don\u2019t want to burn bridges.\n\nI\u2019m struggling with what to prioritize: the immediate financial and professional benefits of this offer, or staying committed to my long-term sustainability career goals and hoping my ideal role will pop up in the next 2-4 months?\n\n**What would you do in my position?** Would love to hear any advice, perspectives, or experiences that could help me make this decision.",

There is literally no better thing you can do than get into the circle of great people.\n\nI would also advise resetting expectations for environmental roles.

Likewise, there are plenty of people who held fast to their dream career and absolutely hate it.\n\nAt the end of the day, it sounds like you're pretty early career.

Why eat shit for a job that you clearly are struggling to get and might never get?

The sustainability world isn\u2019t that large so if you do want to make the transition from this role to sustainability, you\u2019ll be competing with people that have relevant experience with ESG disclosure, decarbonization strategy, GHG accounting, supply chain mgmt, etc. A lot of the required skills are pretty niche as opposed to generalist skills that are easily transferable. \n\nIf you want to work in climate but plan to take this role, a realistic pathway is for you to do this role for a while and then later join a climate tech company in a CSM or commercial role. Companies like Watershed and Workiva are in this space but still need a sales and customer success team. It\u2019s not a sustainability role per se but you could potentially transition to one at some point. I think your chances of that happening are somewhat low but it\u2019s theoretically possible.  \n\nI would suggest that you try to reach out to as many sustainability professionals as possible to build your network if that\u2019s what you want. You can check out orgs like Work on Climate and Open Door Climate as well. \n\nI enjoy my job a lot as I get to work on very interesting projects, engage with great people, and have an excellent manager, but I will say that sustainability doesn\u2019t pay as well as a commercial role.

Shit happens and things change and switch up on us ALL the time. Leave room for improvisation in your goal setting.\n\n2 - Don't work for a company or it's culture, work for a team. If you've already hit the jackpot with a person who you loved working for, was respectful, has a good clean reputation, and is still interested in working with you after years then I'd say your working conditions are going to be significantly smoother and relatively stress free: we don't want to hate the thought of work next day on Sunday night and having a good manager/leader plays a big role in that. \n\nBonus third thing - there is literally nothing stopping you from getting your dream role and title in the future. If the plan is to become Chief Sustainability Officer, why would you wait for someone else to train you for the role on their terms when you could read, study, and network for your dream role while having a stable, good, stress free job right now even if it's in a field that happens to not be aligned with your dream role?

        "content": "Hello everyone, I (24F) am an entrepreneur who has been active primarily in industrial manufacturing and gaming, and now I am trying to find a suitable career path without a degree.\n\nMy situation is quite complex, but I will break it down into simple steps. I studied mechanical engineering and double-majored in Innovation & Design at one of the most prestigious universities in Asia as an international student from Turkey. During the pandemic, I was back in my home country, and my education was online, so I started a mask-making business. I built the business and sold over 20 million masks to six different countries. Afterwards, I returned to Singapore to resume my studies, but things were never the same for me, and I struggled to focus on being a student again.\n\nI then built another business where I acted as the middleman between Turkish industrial manufacturers (mostly CNC machining, injection molding, and sheet metal work) and the U.S. I used my e-commerce skills and knowledge in the field to create a solid network that allowed the business to grow.\n\nOnce I grew my capital, I returned to Turkey, bought CNC machines, and invested in other industrial equipment. At the same time, I owned a Far East restaurant in Istanbul and was a board member at a hospital in my home city. After the machines arrived, we started manufacturing mostly mining equipment, and we currently hold two defense contracts. I also had consultant roles for two large Chinese companies, both state-owned.\n\nIt may be hard to believe, but I also have a gaming company with a few childhood friends. We are now in our second investment round, with a desired valuation of 1.5 million USD. I am the financial lead.\n\nWith all of this, I managed to drop out of two different universities\u2014one in law and one in international relations. These were Turkish universities, and I only enrolled out of curiosity about the fields.\n\nThroughout my career, I\u2019ve always been a problem solver, mostly focused on optimization and sales, and I was the person to establish networks and use them effectively.\n\nBut here is where it gets tricky: I need to leave Turkey due to some family issues. I sold my manufacturing and restaurant businesses, I am on the verge of selling my gaming company, and I want to move out of Turkey by finding a job. I have applied to various jobs, but I imagine that not having a degree is a problem for HR professionals. It\u2019s also very tough to find suitable roles when you have all this entrepreneurial experience but have never worked in a company. I know I would be a valuable addition to any company\u2019s workforce under the right terms, but I don\u2019t know how to express that.\n\nThe first time I prepared a CV was only 10 days ago because, before that, I had never applied anywhere\u2014not even for an internship.\n\nI need guidance and a roadmap. I desperately need to leave Turkey for the time being, and I would like to have a stable income while doing so and shift my career in that direction. What are your thoughts?\n\nP.S.: I don\u2019t want to build another business. I am very tired of my family issues. I need stability.",

I do not have a it degree and it is an entry level position however there are issues I have with my future there. It's my understanding the  community of it and development do not require a four-year degree unless it is at a very intensive or niche area, and there are many companies that have moved in the direction of acquiring a certification boot camp or other methods to grow skills. Currently my department has said my only promotion would come from going to get another four year degree, or becoming proficient enough and python to pass an exam for a junior test engineer. However the issue with that is that you can do no training on the clock, and there is no assistance seeking education. So better yourself you have to find your own time to do so and there is no direction of what would be the best education to get. Also the company currently does not pay industry standard to developers or other staff, so there's no guarantee once completing my education that the company would pay appropriately. Currently I would not make 40K given current company raises at 1.7% per year till maybe 2026 or later. I see technology as a way to provide for myself and have a better life, and if I can find a niche to pour myself into I think I would really enjoy it more. Currently I'm considering finding some way to improve a skill and jump into another company next May, unless there are changes in my department. \n\nCan anybody offer an advice on what direction to go for education or certificates? Someone suggested Tableau, Cisco Certificates, or being good at Python. I'm actually thinking about looking at international jobs too. But I'm 33 years old and really need to buckle down on something and make a career for myself.

            "I'm 25 as well, but no degree, no money, no car, and no job outlook. No savings, barely any food, and no way to pursue education. I'm making ~$20k a year as a janitor, and let me tell you my job is really boring and I get zero satisfaction out of it. You're extremely lucky in the sense that you have financial security and a career at this age, I would kill (not literally) to have that, or even the faintest hope of ever having that. I also have extreme mental health problems that make day to day living almost unbearable.\n\nThis isn't to make you feel bad. Don't sit there and feel guilty because of what I said. Conversely please don't shame me for my position, you don't know the circumstances that lead me here.\n\nI say this because, something I have learned way down here at the bottom barrel of society as a janitor on the brink of homelessness, is that it helps to be grateful for what you do have. You have a spouse, you have money, you have atleast somewhat good mental health I would imagine to be where you are. You have savings. You actually have a future. (Im doubtful i can say the same)\n\nI'm at the opposite end of the economic spectrum from you, yet somehow we both feel completely unfulfilled in life by our careers, or in my case lack thereof. That tells you something, doesn't it?\n\nSee, the career, the money, the cars, the degree, it's all icing on the cake. It's not the cake itself. In my own desperate search in this desolate hellscape we call human society, I've realized I will never EVER be happy without one thing, and it sounds cheesy. It sounds hippy. It sounds stupid if you're not open to it. But it's love. You have to focus on what you love in the world, and pursue it like your life depends on it. \n\nThat's the only way i've kept myself sane. I focus on my girlfriend. I focus on the friends I have, the books and shows I love. I focus on my pets. I focus on my hobbies.\n\nSee, the thing is as a kid you're still in love with the world, and as an adult this gets stomped out of us. You have to learn to embrace your inner child. I may be a janitor, but that doesn't mean at night I can't work on Minecraft videos, or that I can't make music and poetry. I can still draw, I can still self educate on topics that have nothing to do with my job. Hell, right now I'm teaching myself physics and set theory just because I think it's fun. And the thing is, those are the happiest times I have. When I sit down and think of how poor I am, and how I probably won't ever be successful or financially secure or how I probably won't ever be able to own my own house, or how I can't even afford to marry my girlfriend because of how damn broke I am, I get depressed. I get hopeless. I'll even let you in on a secret: I get downright suicidal.\n\nThe only answer is to pursue the things you love. If you don't love your job, then focus your mental energy on something you do love. For me, I can't pursue a job I love right now either. So I try to think of it like this: I may be a janitor by day, but I'm an artist by night. Like a secret identity.\n\nLook for ways to have fun. Instead of doomscrolling, go to a meme page. Instead of just throwing all your files away, crumple them all up and see how many you can toss in the basket for a high score. Instead of sitting in silence, put on some music. No really, just put on something anything when youre in the mindset. Don't sit in the silence, it's an echo chamber.\n\nI would recommend pursuing a hobby, maybe getting a pet if you don't have one. Find some new music you like. Try a new restaurant. Just do something--ANYTHING--to break out of your routine. Go out to a park youve never been to. Make some new friends maybe.\n\nAnd in the meantime, since you do have stability, just take your time to really discover what makes you passionate, and take the time to figure out how to pursue it.\n\nAlso thank you for posting this. I actually needed to hear my own advice bc i was depressed after today before i started typing this. Wish you the best brother mane\ud83d\ude38",

Or maybe a pre-sales engineer for a tech firm, where you go in and figure out what equipment they have and what equipment would work for the client?  You'd get to see your vision come into action.  Even if you took a slight paycut, you could consider any number of field technician positions for various tech-related fields, for example, you could work for Comcast or Windstream or something like that.  You're out and about all day, probably some good human interaction.\n\nAlso, what do your hobbies look like?  You are so set right now, you could try out a bunch of different hobbies, and see which one sticks.  Then, you can dive headfirst into whichever one you fall in love with.  You have the money to do just about any hobby you wanted, and because you've solved your career and relationship situations so early in your life, you have tons of space mentally to do something like that.  You have DECADES to become really great at thing, this could be a very fulfilling path if you find something that really aligns with you.\n\nI also struggle with that same \"what's next?\" feeling, and for me, diving into my newish (been at it for a year now) hobby of dancing has been immensely satisfying.  In fact, that might fulfill the need for human interaction you're missing at work, too.  Or really any social hobby, improv would do, BJJ, TONS of options.",

I had little to do each day, but I was able to leave on time and be home. I decided that I wanted to help people and went back to school for a masters in Occupational Therapy.

I am forced to document outside of work, constantly working with 2 or 3 patients at a time for the entirety of my 8 hour shift. On top of that, I am now 60k in debt, basically living the same life I was before. People have also left me very disillusioned. I work in an ortho clinic and patients are often ungrateful and verbally abusive. All of this along with a terrible commute leaves me with virtually no ability to live a life.

            "my mom graduated with a bachelors in wetland biology. not long after, she realized that she did NOT want to spend all her time either in a smelly lab or a smelly wetland for shit pay. so, she went back to school to become a physical therapist. she did amazingly in school and was good at her job, but after only a little over a year, she decided that wasn\u2019t right for her either. for the past 20+ years, she has been working in sales for medical education companies, and is widely known as one of the best at what she does. she loves her job and gets to work from home making 200-300k a year. and she never would have found the career she has now without the trial and error of the past. all this is to say, you can still find a well paying job that makes you happier than the ones you\u2019ve tried. you\u2019re not locked into one career your whole life, and your experience in other fields may make you all the more interesting to hiring managers. best of luck!",
            "Here is what I know- everyone is struggling to find the RIGHT path that checks all the traditional requirements (\"get certified! get a degree in a reliable field! make sure its relevant! Is it over saturared??\") while also trying to find something that won't destroy them in some way (just scroll thru the FindAPath or HealthyGamerGg and other subreddits and see how many young people are suicidal over these issues). The answers on the surface for this are not easy to find- but when dug deeper, the jobs ARE there. The issue comes that when you are looking deeper where all those jobs are, they are very specific to skill sets and where you shine specifically. \nI just feel like there is a strategy that will be specific to you that once you decide on it, it will work with either a doable amount of stress (meaning an amount of stress that you seem is fine for the interim between now and the change you want to see) as well as feeling that the effort you are putting into the path is worth it. \nWhat a lot of people may or may not realize, is that this kind of stuff leads to a lot more issues than just disappointment. It also comes with all that fun stuff of having a lack of confidence in one's own decision process- hence why people post their woes here for any kind of words of guidance. \nBut listen, you don't really need an entirely \"brand new\" career- you just need a pivot/shift into a way of working that can get you to be more into the lifestyle you want/need. \nSo while I don't really feel like choosing an entirely new career is the next best option for you, \nIt's definitely possible that there is a better career for you. That could look like Project Management or Insurance billing, those both tend to be remote by default in a lot of cases and the PM option has medical specific roles. \nBut OP, you have a big set of skills/experience that has been accumulated through your college degrees and the work you have done. \nFirst off, you probably know the answers to these couple of questions already, but do you know 1) if there are any telehealth options for Occupational Therapists, and 2) Is this the type of career that calms down after you have satisfied the hard stuff in the beginning? Because especially for question 2, for example if you got into the subreddit r/therapists, they are all talking about how they can't wait until they are done with initial phases so they can go into private practice, because the agencies or whatever they have to work in initially forces them to take on 50+ patients at one time and they are burning themselves out. So if occupational therapy is hard right Now, does that have an option to settle down or calm down in a later stage. Even if the answer is yes, it doesn't mean you have to take that option as your path/strategy. And remember, this first step is just trying to gather together your OPTIONS. \nAnd as for question 1, telehealth might be available or maybe there is a way for you to consult in your field too. You want to take a look at what other occupational therapists have done, or are looking at that are adjacent to the field. Keep a notebook and write everything down that comes up and comes to mind even if its unrelated to what you're looking at. \nSomething that a lot of people dont think about WHILE they are in a career is, is there anything I can do/create/write a book about/develop an online course on/invent a product that can add value and/or fill an unmet need? That is another way to either forge ones own path into a self-made career, or on a smaller level could be another way to bring in some cash. \nQuestion 3) Is there any way with which it seems doable/ palatable to temporarily lower your cost of living, because sometimes people will downsize to very small for a year and then their cash flow gets put aside so they can go travel or get their next leg up. I am not saying you have to pay off all your debt (debt is super important to deal with, but also, if it's student debt we are talking about then its mostly important to stay current with your payments or deferments) especially student debt, but as long as you arent defaulting on any payments then you dont have to sacrifice your sanity to have a perfectly clear slate. You just need to find ways to give yourself some wiggle room. \nAnother option I dont hear very often is getting a therapist that has business or your field in their history/background. Meaning, go to a talk therapist with the intention that they will help you figure out how to get your life turned around. A lot of times, people only think about someone \"turning their life around\" when its got addictions or crime. But Im of the mindset that we can \"turn our life around\" at any point we find ourselves headed down the wrong path, in any context that might be. So, you might have to pay out of pocket to get that kind of a therapist, but it might be the support you need to feel more confident in your decisions of the next steps. \nSaving cash- this is something that I have seen get people out of their situation. Sometimes its because just having that extra savings gives them the confidence to make a switch or feel like it gives them more options. There's people who have saved money at every turn just so they can buy a house. There is one woman online teaching budgeting, she did this for her house, she challenges that when people say they dont make enough to save that they dont really see all the places that they can save. Again, it's fine if for you this just isn't the case, but I mention it because sometimes when stressed we don't see all the options and its worth mentioning this if it is for you. \nStart looking at resume building and interview processes and advice on them. Im not kidding around when I say that studying/learning this can help your confidence and it also can end up leading you to different things about the careers out there. \nAnd talk to people around you, and in your field, and start networking and getting intel about things. You may find out that people have made switches and changes that you haven't thought of yet- inside and outside the career. \nI didn't mention the marketing, but the steps would apply the same to looking at what's out there for remote jobs in this field. I would also be looking out there for any companies that are at the crossroads of marketing and occupational therapy. For example, maybe there if a software company that was created to be used for Occupational therapists, and they are hiring someone in marketing. But you would never really know because that wont show up on a regular search.\nI hope some of this gives you some ideas on what you could do next!",

            "I've been in your shoes before. I worked in a startup where I ran 12-14 hours per day, mainly doing minimal tasks that \"kept me busy\" instead of being productive. I was burnt out, missing my personal life and life was miserable because of the stress. Then I made a shift to work for a corporation in town. I thought the slower pace would give me more time back in my personal life, but we were required to be ass-in-seat every day, 8-5:30. Then I had an hour commute each way. At the time, I had two little ones and I was missing out on so much of their life. That's when I realized I wanted two things: \n\n* More control over my schedule and pay\n* More time with my family so I didn't miss out on the memories. \n\nSo I made another change, in fact, I made 3 career changes within a 12 month period. I made the changes to progress toward my goal of working for myself. Each job I took presented an opportunity to learn. With each job, I asked questions, worked with individuals I knew would help me with my own business and kept learn. \n\nThen I started side hustles. I started consulting, mainly running projects for small businesses who needed the help. I bankrolled these funds and started to 1) pay off debt and 2) build a cushion. One side hustle turned into multiple! \n\nNow I'm getting close to being able to quit my job, live off of my side hustles, and spend as much time with my family. \n\nI love it because 1) I'm still making decent money, 2) I have control of my life 3) I don't have to deal with people and if I do, it's through email (customer support). My life is improving drastically but it took a drastic shift in my mentality to get here.",

Which there are still some it\u2019s not as widely used anymore to keep employees in various industries. So in a weird way now you can be able to leave a career path if you don\u2019t like it without losing out. \n\nThough the trade off is a 401k account which is basically self funded retirement. But that lets you do whatever you want instead of hating your career and having golden handcuffs if you will until retirement. \n\nSo do some research in some areas that are growing and see if they align with your interests as a career and seek folks out to get an idea of what the day to day is because sometimes those conversations are better than reading a job posting to see really what is expected in various roles. Check out county/state employment resources sometimes they have funding to support reskilling in growing fields.  Good luck!",

        "content": "Hi everyone, I am new on to this subreddit anyways I feel that I am lost in life. I am 37 M; I have graduated of a master's degree of an aerospace related field but not engineering. I have been struggling since the past year of trying to go for my field of studies which is Aerospace to go for the Space Sector, but it's been difficult I have got some interviews but as of recent nothing has come up. This is getting me worried, anxious and in a depression, suffering a mid-life crisis, thinking I don't have a future which is scaring me and shattering my heart and hope to pieces.\n\nAnyways a background of me I am working in retail since almost 16 years of my life, and I want to move out of there. I am so sick and tired of retail it sickens me every time I go to work in the store there. I want to leave so badly but the thing is I can't because it's the only job I have and if I leave that's it no income which hurts me. But I have also been working part time and I am done with Retail, don't want to do retail anymore in my life.\n\nAs I went for my master's I rediscovered my love for Aerospace Engineering I love how awesome it is and said that's what I want to do. But problem with me is that I don't have an Engineering background. But I want to work in cool space projects, even defense as well with rockets, spacecrafts and the like. But I am nowhere near there and said to myself this is where I want to be I want to do that. I want to be part of an awesome team building incredible machines that are going to other planets and into space. Such as NASA's Artemis, DoD Space and the like.\n\nSo, it's making me reconsider of going back to university for Aerospace Engineering. I am looking at a couple of universities now but yeah just going through a rough patch in my life and also applying for employment at the university. Also want to get an Aerospace Engineering background.\n\nSo, all in all, I want to where I work at to go for the Space sector, don't have an engineering degree but is planning to get it so I can have a STEM/ ABET Degree. Gosh I feel such a failure. I have a B.A.S. degree, I got an M.S. and still nothing.\n\nWhat is it that I can do as a person in my late 30s trying to restart my life and course correct myself of my trajectory of my future. I want a future.",

            "Gosh this is a really hard one.  \n\nIt's a noble thing to do to pursue education, the theoretical idea behind it is morally good, that you will improve your intelligence and skills to benefit society and yourself.  \n\nBut if you fell for a Masters the first time and it hasn't benefit you, I have to throw caution there.  Why exactly are you getting sold to double down again on education, when it hasn't benefit you at all previously?  (Have you *actually* had a positive ROI from your education thus far?  Has it helped you get higher level positions, if nothing else at least within your retail career?)\n\nNot playing devil's advocate for no reason, but I'm genuinely curious if you have a clear answer.\n\nIn my direct experience, engineering isn't a guarantee of any type of success anymore and is almost as much of a gamble as your previous degrees. Especially now that everybody is saying engineering is the only major (other than nursing) with value.  There will be a lot more people pursuing engineering degrees shortly, it's really the only major left with value at the bachelor's level.  Combined with the recent major white collar and tech layoffs, it doesn't make me super confident about the amount of jobs there will be in the future for it.  Or their pay grade.",
            "Take this with a grain of salt because I'm kind of in the same boat as you. I'm 38.\n\nI spent my life with aspirations of becoming an attorney and trying to get into a political career of sorts only to graduate in 2012 with everyone talking about law schools ripped them off and lied to them everybody was suing really freaking scary to then go into the law of profession taking on six figures of undischargeable debt. My dream job and my career path was essentially crushed right in front of me even though I just taken a bunch of stupid classes for a stupid bachelor's degree that wouldn't really get me a job in the real world it was really just preface to a law degree. Case you're wondering I got a political science degree- on its face it's not great and it's not bad but it's one of those degrees that you take along your way to getting your Juris doctorate.\n\nBecause I determined it was way too risky to get a Juris doctorate I floundered around several different jobs and several different sectors. I ended up finding Insurance of all freaking things. I absolutely hate it. Every single day I'm the bad guy because people who bought Insurance didn't read their policies and don't know how it works and then get mad when they file a claim for something that isn't covered and then I have to tell them that it's not covered thus making me the bad guy. The problem is I make too much damn money to walk away from it. A base salary of 80k and if I work overtime I've cleared as high as 170k. Sounds like a dream job based on the numbers but like you I get up every single day and I go to work absolutely dreading it because it deals with people and people are typically assholes. I'm also trying to explore the career path of what I should go back to school for if at all and if it's worth the debt and whether there will be an Roi on that debt.\n\nYou sound like you're really passionate about engineering I can't tell you that getting an engineering degree is going to be worth it in terms of money and I can't promise you that you're going to get the job that you want, but what I can tell you from my own experiences in life is that if you are this passionate about something and you don't pursue it you are going to regret this the rest of your life. If you take on more debt to get an education and land you a job that you're happy or at least mostly happy at even though you may not live some lavish lifestyle because you'll be paying back the debt from borrowing I think in the long run you'll still feel more fulfilled and ultimately happier than if you got another job that made a lot of money but you were ultimately miserable at.\n\nEverybody wants a high paying salary until they get a job that pays them well But takes their soul every day. You're going to have to find the balance for yourself because only you know what's right for you but I'll tell you that if you look to your inner self and the one thing you can conclude is that you really want to be an engineer then you need to listen to that voice and you need to apply yourself in every facet of your life to be coming that thing that you desire so deeply. \n\nIf I could go back in time and convince myself to have gone to law school in spite of the risks because it would have made me happier knowing that I had pursued my dreams I would have just as I'm telling you now that if this is your dream and you already have a background in it relatively speaking don't let your dreams be dreams go make them a reality man.",

What if you get that job and don't work on anything significant? Or noticeable? Will that be a failure?\n\nI suggest not defining your life by what job you get. There is no guarantee you will get something you like OR, even worse, that you will get the job you fought to get and find out you think it sucks.\n\nYou can still make a difference in your life by how you live it and what you leave for others. This can be as small as raising children who are a joy to be around (not little hellions), doing some art and leaving that for posterity, working your job to make money to enjoy life, volunteering to help others, and many other ideas. \n\nI get it, I once had dreams like that, but situations demanded other things, and being flexible is a key to success (IMHO). I have raised some wonderful children, have lived in two countries - visited many, been a paper millionaire at one point (stock options), a war vet, wrote some books, helped others in need, and have a great bunch of friends that think well of me (well some think I am a funny asshole but I count that too).\n\nJoy and success can be measured in many ways. Consider this before you tear down the path of more debt and a job you might or might not enjoy.\n\nEither way, I wish you happiness and luck.",

            "In my late twenties/early thirties, learned that I loved using Excel and creating reports, calculations and lookups. I played around with this for a few years, learned how to use Crystal Reports and Business Objects, and found an opportunity to dive in head first at a company who wanted me to implement Power BI as their new reporting solution. That was just after I turned forty. I just turned forty-eight and in a new company ready to start moving towards more automated reporting solutions.\n\nI went to college for art, eventually walking away with a bachelor of fine arts degree. It took me about ten years. I was almost thirty and had no clue about what I wanted to do.\n\nMy suggestion is to be open to possibilities. Put ideas to paper. Take time to do some career research. Look up jobs that interest you, even if you don\u2019t qualify on paper. Figure out what they want, what are salaries like, is there anything online that you can find about career burnout or advancement in that area. Once you have a direction, carefully fold up those notes and tuck them under your pillow; sleep on the idea. Picture yourself doing this job before going to sleep.\n\nIf it feels good, go for it. Start slow by doing interviews, and getting yourself out there. If something doesn\u2019t feel right at any time, stop. Reassess and start over again. Stay positive and it\u2019ll not only help get you to your goal, it will help you pass the time and get through any stress at your current job.\n\nHave faith. Remember that it\u2019s not about tuning everything else out to concentrate on your new path, but rather that you pay attention to the signs and situations. An opportunity can come from anywhere and take many forms.

They help you to get somewhere, but that's pretty useless if you don't know where you want to get to in the first place.  You could do a certificate in, say, Python, but what's the point if you don't really want a career in computer programming (or something related)?  What happens if you do a project management course but find you hate project management?\n\nThe way I'd start is like this: I ask my clients (I'm a career coach) to start with some exercises which focus on three main things: (1) strengths; (2) what you enjoy doing; and (3) values i.e your drivers and the things which are important to you.\r  \n\r  \nWhen you get to know yourself better and start to build a clear picture in these three areas you begin to have a much better idea of the sorts of things that you'll likely enjoy doing and succeed at.  Then you can get out there and figure out what might be a match for you, and then what you can do to make it a reality, including what additional qualifications, if any, you might need.\r  \n\r  \nFor me the first stage is knowing more about yourself to get more clarity on the direction you might take before you even think about going back to school or taking any courses.\r  \n\r  \nIf this approach sounds interesting, I have [a couple of exercises on my website](https://changeworklife.com/two-exercises-to-help-you-find-career-happiness/) which might give you a good starting point.",

Before I went for my masters I told my mom that I wanted to wait, live my life, and explore other paths. She had a breakdown and called someone to give me a *wellness check.* Other paths that I was considering at the time were massage therapy, naturopathy, social work, or counselling. I applied for an MA in Urban Planning because, well, because it was peak covid and I was tempted by the allure of job security, social status, and my family didn't like the idea of the other paths I was considering. Urban planning made sense to me in my head, but my heart was leaning towards a profession that helps others more directly. \n\nNow, I'm almost two years out from finishing my Masters, got about 10k of debt, and I'm absolutely miserable. I genuinely hate going to work everyday, I don't want to do any professional development or networking cause i can't stand pretending to care. I know that a lot of people think urban planning is cool and interesting, but i just can't help but find it insanely boring. The thought of being in this line of work for the rest of my working life makes my heart sink. \n\nI feel like I made a huge mistake with what I chose to study, and I'm full of regret. I've been getting really down on myself and feel like I've f\\*cked up my life. Getting an MA also just has a lot more weight to it than a bachelors, and I feel like I need to commit to it since I worked so hard to get it (and spent so much $$). \n\nIf I could re-do it all, I'd go to school for acupuncture, osteopathy, or naturopathy. I'm really interested in alternative medicine and I love working with people (I was a server for 6 years while i went through school). The thing is that all of these programs are 4 years where i'm from. I just don't know if it's worth it to go into more debt. \n\nAnyone out there got any advice or experience changing careers and going back to school? Anyone out there work in alternative medicine who can provide insight into working in the field? \n\nIf you've taken the time to read this far, you have my most sincere thanks!! <3 I truly appreciate you!!

You think so because you hate what you do so much. Truthfully, you\u2019re looking to get something out of work you probably won\u2019t find even if you switch careers. Find what you are looking for outside of the workplace and be grateful for the things your work provides. Or quit and take a leap, maybe you will actually enjoy your new career. That said, looking for advice like this from me or anyone else on Reddit sounds like another poor choice",

If alternative medicine excites you, why not start small with certifications in areas like massage therapy or acupuncture to test the waters before committing to a full program.

        "content": "(27 /M/ Midwest USA) First reddit post \ud83d\ude00 \nI live in a decent sized city in the Midwest. \nPretty dissatisfied with my job but I'm kind of in a position where I need to smoothly transition into something much better while still retaining some schedule flexibility. Advancement at my current job is basically not a possibility. I've always felt I've just been working whatever job I had to get by until my dream job came along but I know it doesn't work like that. Would love to get into a more creative job and utilize skills I've developed through hobbies (art, digital art, some IT n diagnostic skills). \nWould love a gig as a tattoo artist, animator, or start a laser engraver business. Something where I get to draw and be creative but still work in a more technical and methodical way. \nApplied to community college; make too much money for financial assistance to be of use but too little money to pay out of pocket.\nTattoo shop market is very saturated here. I have little money available to get tattoos regularly and build shop relationships that way. No art school so not a lot of stuff worthy of putting together into a portfolio.\nNo animation or bigger game company to get in the mail room here as far as I know.\n\nCurrently a part time manager at a Papa John's for $15/hrs. I've been there for about 2.5 years. Ran a Handyman business for 6 months before I needed a more steady gig. 2.5 years at a Controls / Construction company before that. Been working since before I was 15yo, most of my work history being either food prep/service or construction. I believe I am a quality employee in both fields given time to learn the job/company specifics. Just bought my first house with my fianc\u00e9. Only child is almost 1 now. Cut down hours from 40ish hours to 30ish hours because the fianc\u00e9 worked the ladder and jumped to her old job for better pay and position.\n\nWorking on touching up my resume and sending it around to some better paying gigs. However with limited babysitter time and no college degree I feel locked out of many meaningful opportunities. Not to mention the modern job hunt is its own bleak grind.\nFeels like I squandered my free time and education prospects when I was a younger man and now I'm really paying for it. Just want to provide a good life for my family while feeling like I'm in a career I care about.\nGuess I'm just looking for some support and/or new ideas/avenues.\n\nUPDATE: Got the job. Just finished second day of training. Seems like it is going well. Trying to fit in gaming and creative hobbies. Went to neighborhood health clinic and started getting some help for latent mental health issues. Trying to spend more time with my family. Thanks for the support.",

            "Hi! I am 34. I brewed beer from 22-32 and it was my whole life.  I was a lead brewer for 6 years, had some notoriety and a lot of respect in my field\u2026 honestly it was hard to leave something I was so good at.  But the money wasn\u2019t great, benefits were non existent, I was always injured/exhausted/stressed\u2026. I had A LOT of responsibility and found myself at the brewery at 2am a lot of nights reassuring myself I had turned the water off.  Toward the end of my career I had a head injury, broken collar bone, broken ribs, a messed up ankle and knee, and I could never take time off to fully recover. ANYWAY I lost it when the brewery owners accused me of stealing time (I had been working 60 hour weeks for months while they traveled around the world).  I quit, it was a mess, and I moved to temp work while I figured out next steps.\n\nI got another head injury 4 days into temp work as a forklift driver.  Someone about 20 feet above me dropped a steel beam on my head.  (They got above me by traversing high shelving, I had no idea they were up there, it sucked.) That TBI rocked my world and long story short\u2026 I think I was on autopilot for months.  I have almost 2 years in the tech industry now as a salesforce consultant.  I\u2019m still not sure how I got here some days.\n\nIt felt like do or die I guess? I wasn\u2019t exactly motivated, I just got shit done. I gave all the context of head injuries because I think I really was just out of it a lot of the time. I didn\u2019t question anything. I completely disassociated. I was burned out and mentally exhausted. I slept 12 hours a night.  I quit drinking entirely (sober 2+ years yay).  \n\nI didn\u2019t have a family, that\u2019s a whole other level of respect if ya do.  I can\u2019t imagine taking care of kids and doing it.  Am I happy now? Ummm not really.  Tech really is a rat race.  I miss being *good* at something.  I miss feeling like an expert and interacting with coworkers in person.  The moment you\u2019re good at something in tech, it changes. Never ending exhaustive learning. I\u2019ve learned that I need social interaction a lot more than I realized.  I have yet to get over my imposter syndrome.  My anxiety is pretty bad, never know if I\u2019m doing enough.  Researching and figuring stuff out takes soooo long and some days I feel like I have nothing to show for my 8 hours.\n\nBUT one thing that has massively improved is my feeling of hope? I don\u2019t feel doomed. I feel like I\u2019m in a field where I can grow and have some autonomy.  I can switch jobs, learn new things, and get more money every time.  \n\nI dunno, the grass feels a little greener in tech\u2026 but I miss being physical, tactile, and human.  It might not bother you as much.  I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m a part of anything important. I don\u2019t have work friends or relationships\u2026 \n\nOk I\u2019ll shut up. Just my experience.  Money means a lot, I\u2019m grateful to be getting a better paycheck, but I\u2019m not really happy.",

I would not have been able to do it without the financial and emotional support from my wife. She encouraged me the whole way. So did my friends and family.

Yes I had management experience and understood logistics and operations, but I was essentially starting over.  It had been more than 10 years since college and I forgot everything about Geology.  I guess I could have run oil rigs but that\u2019s a hard life.  I jumped from job to job as a defense contractor before going to grad school and finding a new career in Procurement.  I did not have a family during this time which was helpful.

All that was temporary though and I was able to climb the ladder faster than my peers. 30s is a great time for a career change if you can make it work.  You are seen as young enough to learn, train, and grow with the company. You are also not a \u201ckid\u201d.

            "I chose the wrong career, too. I ended up choosing architecture without any other reasons than I have to choose something, and architecture sounds good.\n\nArchitecture had little to do with my skills and I didn't care much for the results. Unfortunately, I had to come into contact with the field and the work to realize it.\n\nIt took me years to realize and ultimately decide I didn't want to spend my days looking for solutions to problems I didn't care for.\n\nI won't describe how a wrong career choice that didn't match my strongest abilities affected my ability to produce good work, or how it made me feel inadequate and unhappy. But it did.\n\nI took the hint and the opportunity to jump off the architecture field after a contract expired and wasn't renewed. I came to terms with the fact that I chose the wrong career and had spent over a decade on the wrong professional path.\n\nFortunately, I gained experience and knowledge that allowed me to develop a better sense of my preferences. Experience and growth made clear the issues I cared about, the issues that repelled me, and the ones I was indifferent to.\n\nI became aware of the activities I was most capable of. To my surprise reading, gathering, organizing, working, and re-purposing information.\n\nI built my career change on staying away from design, visuals, materials, and spatial concepts. I didn't want to think of or conceive objects anymore.\n\nWithout a full picture yet, I started to look for new work positions that I could picture myself doing. The opportunity came through my language skills.\n\nA multinational company was looking for language natives to review and increase their language and database commands for electronic devices. It was a two-month project, 8 hours, five days a week.\n\nI didn't particularly care for entering new sentences in a database, testing new voice commands, and writing reports. But I was good at it. I didn't care for the result of my work effort but I enjoyed dealing with information.\n\nI transitioned into the education&language field. Going through information and explaining it to young people seemed to suit me, and so did staying home alone doing translations. I enjoyed both activities, in appropriate doses.\n\nThe right career path was not a single path. I learned through experience that work, put on the 8 hours, five days a week work schedule was incompatible with my well-being.\n\nI like teaching, I like searching for information and writing. The problem was not the type of activity I was doing, nor a lack of care for the results. It was all going downhill because of the amount of effort I had to put in. My mind and body were getting drained by too much time dedicated to that one task and subject.\n\nWhat does career success mean to me? I am currently doing this and it\u2019s working for me. The career change I needed was variety and controlled amounts of effort. I do enjoy working and I work long hours, but I do it on top of a diverse routine.\n\nPart of the day I write, part of it I read, part of it I learn, part of it I teach, and part of it I rest or go outside and spend time with my wife.\n\nA full-time job wasn\u2019t working for me so I didn\u2019t get stuck with it. Here is a list of the type of work I do and have done after changing careers in my early 30s:\n\n\\- Language specialist - Language proficiency evaluator - Translator - Teacher - International conferences booth host - Commercial actor, voice actor\n\nI select work that deals primarily with information and my language skills (English, French, Spanish, Portuguese).\n\nI do acting work because my wife is an actress and because it's short-term and diverse, and pays well. I don't particularly value the result.\n\nHow do my new career paths work? I don't get all my eggs from the same chicken. Teaching and acting are the main providers.\n\nI don't own a car, a house, or a pet. I don't owe anyone anything. My wife and I work and live in four countries. Change is built into our way of life.\n\nMy wife adopted the same multiple-careers approach. We made compatible life choices and have compatible life goals.\n\nI hope this gives you some perspective and good luck!",

            "Soo I'm 26 and actually am in the process of switching career paths. I graduated 5 years ago with a Bachelor's of Kinesiology,  which didn't yield much aside from personal training. I actually just withdrew from a Physicsl Therapist Assistant program and that was a really mentally demanding program where I, like you, was studying hours on end daily. I just didnt want a career in healthcare to be honest.\n\nI think it's REALLY important for you to find a way to work some sort of physical activity into your day, whether it's walking, stretching, cardio, or weights. You will feel much better. \n\nThe takeaway from my program was that I need to be active to be happier. I have cut back tremendously on my physical activity because of school, and I definitely see it now. Gonna get back into it slowly. \n\nAs for everything else, I don't have kids. I actually got married while i was in school at the court house. Hubby pretty much supports me right now with the support of my parents as well (a blessing surely) and I actually have been looking for work for awhile. The job search has been extremely mentally taxing but I have finally been getting some entry level interviews. \n\nWhat's next? I want to work on a small business I have, and I'm also really getting into wanting to learn engineering. I refuse to pay a other cent of my own money to a college AGAIN, though. Ideally it would be nice to find a workplace that'll pay for that. \n\nGood luck with your journey OP...I realize this response was mostly about me but just know you're not alone and it does get better! Just make sure you take mental breaks through physical activity and I suggest trying something like Hellofresh to help make meals more convenient for you. (Though this company is extremely annoying with their marketing so be careful lol)",
            "41 and finishing my bachelor's to transition to project management from small business management. I have 4 kids (3 teens, one middle schooler), and my spouse makes an okay enough income to handle my hours reduction for school, but not good enough to quit and just focus on school. \n\nI'm in the grind now. Class, work, then come home and study. I should be done in 2 years. I've told my friends I love them and will see them when I'm done. \n\n Thankfully, my husband's a good partner who has taken over a lot of the household management stuff that takes a lot of time, and the kids are old enough to participate in the household care tasks, and secure and communicative enough that we still get moments to connect during the week.  I don't miss a goodnight hug and kiss and I never turn down a hug when it's offered or sought. \n\nI had a meltdown last week over the level of Stuff I have going on (my husband is also recovering from knee surgery, and both his and our son's cars are on the fritz, and the garbage disposal stopped working). \n\nI'm learning to be okay with Cs in a particularly tough class. It doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to be done (this part is so hard). The two things that are absolutes for my mental health are therapy and Friday night being blow off steam night.",
            "At 36 I've currently been in tech for a little over a year. I was network operations at Mastercard for a few months before I landed my current career as a software engineer. I was in the Air Force all through my 20's and planned on making a career out of it. After 10 years I was medically retired. I had a wife and two kids and no idea what I was going to do. Shortly after being separated from the military, my wife left me and took the kids. I couldn't find a job, had to sell my house, vehicles got repossessed, had to move into a crappy rental back home. Thankfully I had a VA paycheck coming in or I would have been on the streets. I got rock bottom around this time, working crappy jobs as I could find them. Finally found a job that I enjoyed as a low-voltage contractor and also got to do a bunch of other stuff there. But I couldn't make enough there and there growth potential was nothing. I used my GI bill to get my Computer Science degree with an emphasis in Cyber security. I worked the job I was at while taking a full course load and I even took classes through the summer. Then finding a job after that was tough too because everybody wants you to have experience, even when you're just entering the field. Almost everyday I felt like giving up. Some days I don't even know what kept me going. My biggest hurdle was myself. I would think I have given all I have to give when in reality I figured out as long as I'm still alive, there's always more to give. I'm extremely happy that I made it through because now I'm doing something I truly enjoy and can keep learning and growing with. \n\nDon't feel guilty about splurging a day or doing something that recharges you. You have to remind yourself sometimes why you're even doing what you're doing. Good luck on your journey!",

            "I worked in the entertainment industry for 17 years, starting when I was 17. I was a high level video wall designer, stage content creator and lighting designer. You name a top 40 hip hop artist in the 2010s and I either worked with them or had a friend who did. I basically felt as if I did not work and just made art. Stayed up drinking and partying all the time and generally having a fucking blast. Then Covid rolled around and my overworked ass just sat back and watched the world burn while I took the mental vacation I sorely, sorely needed. I was absolutely beyond burnt out and disgustingly fatigued. I didn\u2019t do anything for an entire year. I didn\u2019t work, I didn\u2019t answer the phone, I didn\u2019t do fuck all and it felt great. I was getting up with the sun instead of going to bed when it came up and I was drawing for myself again.\n\nThen the tours started back up and I was getting hassled to go back so I did but it wasn\u2019t the same. Everything was frigid and boring, with an air of survival and uncertainty that our industry would ever even come back. I hated being there. I hated the workflow, the buttons hurt my hands now and the drugs stopped being appealing. So I continued to work at that for awhile with absolutely no heart in it. \n\nA friend of mine had noticed that I had automated a shit load of things at my job and was really impressed by how hard I worked but sad I was burned out, so he offered me a job working on car AI instead, and I took it. \n\nI work in an office 9-5 and have great pay and benefits. I make a little more than I did, it\u2019s quieter, and the stress level is 0, relatively speaking. I don\u2019t deal with crazy artists or managers that feel like mafia bosses anymore. I sit on my couch with my cats and work on abstract problems revolving around computers and databases. It took quite a bit of acclimation, and over a year later I am still not quite fully used to it, but I am happier.",

I am also now working in the field of Advocacy for those with Kabuki as a Volunteer for Kabuki Syndrome Foundation (KSF) and I am also planning on returning to school in the Fall (the perpetual student) to get my Prerequisite classes so that I can apply for my Masters in Genetic Counseling.  I do not have a family yet (currently live at home) and I am 37 (turning 38 in May) but I know I could not have a family until I was completely done with school because I saw my mom working on her doctorate while trying to raise a family.\r  \n\r\n\nI have lived a fairly normal life so far.  I keep a balance because I allow myself time in the evenings, and I enjoy doing my Church work and my Volunteer Work.  I also participate in Bible Studies on Tuesday nights which is important to me.  And I try to not take on too many roles with KSF (but am about to start doing another one).  Luckily for the most part, my Church Office Work is fairly light most of the time (right now is crazy but it is because I am stuffing Easter Eggs on my own for our Church Easter Egg Hunt).

I at one point was close when I was doing Mom2Mom Babysitting because I was not taking enough time for me.  But I had friends.  What has kept me sane is my faith and my passion for helping others.

            "From 22-33 I was adrift professionally. I primarily worked as a designer and fabricator in small graphics shops making signs and banners. I maxed out at about $20/hr. I wasn\u2019t very career focused because I spent all my free time partying and doing comedy, standup, improv, sketch. But I also wasn\u2019t very serious about that as far as making a career out of it. Maybe I thought it was a pipe dream. At 32 I proposed to my gf (now wife) and decided I should get serious. I decided to go to B-school full time and get an MBA. So I quit my job and we moved cities. I got the MBA. It was a very transformational time. I was offered a job working as a project manager at a blue chip manufacturer. The money wasn\u2019t what I was hoping for. We also had plans to move south, so I turned down the job and took my chances. Almost a year went by and I was unemployed. Couldn\u2019t get a job to save my life. I had a hard time articulating what it was that I even thought I could do. My wife worked FT and kept us afloat. I was miserable. Maybe the lowest I ever felt. I had turned our lives upside down for nothing. Then the same company that had offered me a job a year earlier reached out again. I flew up there as fast as I could. Interviewed again. Got the job and the rest is history. I took a low starting pay ($65k) but it was enough and it was a start. Over the next 4 years I got promoted 2x and was making 6-figs for the first time in my life. Now I\u2019m in sales. Still with the same company. Working remotely. Am I happier? Hard to say. I often look back on my 20s through rose colored glasses. I miss those times. But they are long gone anyway. Now I make a good living and we live the remote work lifestyle. Traveling around the country. Living in different locales for weeks or months. Honestly it\u2019s alright. Maybe not as fun as I dreamed it. Vacation is a state of mind. So is working.

            "I\u2019m 32, made a big change last year. So basically I worked in healthcare for about ten years, mostly in administrative and patient education roles. Generally no interest in healthcare nor passion for it, but I like helping people and it paid the bills so whatever. In the year leading up to March 2020 and for almost 2 years of the pandemic was working for a healthcare tech startup that was small and great when I started, and by the time I left had about 2000 employees, was worth over a billion dollars, newly had signed on Amazon as their biggest client and had turned into a fucking nightmare. Left there for a non-healthcare job in municipal government that turned out to be even worse (experienced horrible homophobia, everyone I worked with was openly racist and xenophobic). Ended up getting fired (for the first time in my life) - reason I was given in the termination meeting was that I had sent an email my department director found \u201cannoying\u201d. \n\nANYway decided to take a break from working as I was still dealing with burnout from the tech startup job, lived off unemployment and under the table, freelance work for a significant chunk of last year. It was pretty hard not knowing what to do with myself some days and being poorer than I was used to, but it really gave me time to think about what I really wanted to be doing, and to seek it out. \n\nLong story (kinda) short, I figured out that what I really wanted was to be in non-profit work that was more service oriented and people-facing, and was ideally more proximate to the community I live in, which is very diverse and poor, with very few government sponsored social services available. Ended up applying for a job I was only kind of interested in - an administrative job designing novel programming at a youth center that serves vulnerable youth in my city. They ended up contacting me and instead asking if I would be willing to interview for a position at an alternative high school that is a joint venture between the youth center and the public school department, basically as something of a guidance counselor mixed with vice principal-esque duties. Interviewed, got the job, and it\u2019s the happiest I\u2019ve ever been at a job in my adult life. Starting salary was on par with my past couple positions, significantly more paid time off than I\u2019ve had before, between school vacations, summer break and regular PTO, and the relationships all the staff have with each other are genuinely great, without all of the hokey \u201cculture building\u201d bs big companies love to distract their employees with. Plus, it turns out I love working with youth and I\u2019m like, really good at it. \n\nI guess all that is to say I don\u2019t regret for a second taking the time to make a huge career change, even though the in-between time was often really hard emotionally and financially. I definitely didn\u2019t really anticipate working in education, and absolutely just fell into it, I feel like I\u2019m on a much more purposeful path now that I wouldn\u2019t be on if I hadn\u2019t made the risky decision of not jumping right back into the healthcare field.\n\nI will say that I\u2019m still working on reversing some things that occurred because of my period of unemployment. During that time I had to rely on using credit cards for the first time ever, and still have a bit of that debt I\u2019m carrying and working on paying off. My mental health took a hit in some ways, but it already wasn\u2019t great because of the strain from my previous jobs. I did things like going to parks or to the library to read, instead of doing so in my home, just as daily excuses to get outta the house. Did a lot of sewing, got good at doing nail art.

            "37M, transitioned from software testing to software development after 10yrs in IT when I was 35, only 2yrs ago. \n\nI have 3 yrs worth of savings. No family and no morgage.\n\nBreaking points:\nJuly 2020 - got laid off but it's because they made me choose to join a project I'm not interested in\n\nJune 2021- after 3 months of being laid off, I found a new job with higher salary. But I again resented my job and this is when I fully committed to transitioning and I resigned\n\nAugust 2021- two months of being unemployed while studying and I felt doom and was comparing myself to my peer who is now a Managing Director, while I will be back to Engineer 1. Also I have no confidence against the uncertainty of finding a job at my age\n\nNovember 2021- I was surprised I got a job as a software engineer, just 1 month after I decided to apply for jobs, and after 3-4months of full time self-study\n\nJune 2023 - I resigned after not being promoted. lol\n\nNovember 2023-Now(August 2024) - unemployed and I travelled to 4 SEA countries, plus Japan, Taiwan, Hongkong and Macau. \n\nMy main negative thought was about the wasted time and opportunities of transitioning much earlier, and that my new position and salary would be very very low. I live in the Philippines btw. Also that some of my peers are now Managing Directors and Managers while I will be starting as Engineer 1. In fact, even when I have already transitioned, I got angry and frustrated of my Engineer 1 position and one of the reasons I resigned as I found it humiliating.\n\nIs it worth it? Yes, definitely. I have no regrets at all even though I had negative feelings towards my low position. I am self-studying again, will be building prototypes and will be applying for jobs soon. I don't plan to go back to software testing anymore, at least not in the near future, and I'm quite good in my job as software developer. But then I plan to transition to another career again, maybe on the side, like working for the government, or something.\n\nHow do I feel now? Well, I remember during the pandemic, I had a strong urge to buy my own house/condo because of the restrictions of the pandemic. And I felt like I have no choice but to imprison myself to pay for the mortgage in a job that I don't want. When transitioning, I had to let go of a lot of things, the possibility of buying my own house/condo, and of getting a high position. And I have accepted that fully.  And I now, I am more confident as ever in pursuing the things that I really want, things I want to do, and accepting the compromises that comes with it. While at the same time, I had to question myself \"do I have to settle for this?\", or \"are there other ways?\" because those are the questions I didn't ask myself when I felt stuck in my previous career.",

I faced with promlems then continued with financal problems. Now I am starting over again in one another country. I hope everyone can achieve that. But it is really hard to concentrate because you have to fund yourself, work part time to pay rent, cook and learn new field. This is much stressfull comparing to when you 20 years old.

Did that for 6 months on the weekends and worked at a daycenter for disabled kids. Now I'm an RBT, in school finishing my bachelor's degree and considering next steps. \n\nI got burnt out plenty of times along the way, I think it comes with the nature of having to work and do additional work on the side. I had a family, have a family and try to balance as best as I can. This means putting my schoolwork aside if I can to have dinner, spend quality time together and a lot of studying when everyone is asleep.

            "I did defense contracting in the DC area after I got out of the Army. The money was good, but I didn't like what I was doing. It also seemed like the good salary was keeping me from going back to school, and I really wanted to earn my degree. I ended up getting let go when I was 32-years-old, and my wife was pregnant with our first kid. \n\nI moved back to the city where my parents lived and got a mechanical designer job with flexible hours so I could go to college. I worked 40-60 hour weeks, supported my family (which had grown to 4 by this point), and finished my mechanical engineering degree from 2014-17. I graduated when I was 36. \n\nI did not live a balanced life during this transition. \"Balance\" in my case meant balancing work and school. Most of the time it meant running full tilt at work while doing as much schoolwork as possible. My wife and kids got whatever time I had left over after everything else. My wife supported me 100% because she knew it was the path to long term stability. Money was tight this entire time, but I never missed any bill payments and avoided debt. \n\nIn the end it all worked out. It took three years to get back up to the salary I was making as a contractor once I was in a mechanical engineering job. We live where we wanted to live, own a house, and now I'm able to pay out of pocket for my wife to finish her degree.

I also have an English degree and no supply chain certifications.\n\nI put myself in a position to learn as much as possible with the first company. That led to a lot of stress and having to ask millions of questions because I knew literally nothing going in.\n\nBut it paid off in the end. It was a matter of figuring out the full gamut of what I knew, finding a good industry to get into where I could use it, and then jumping into stuff with both feet, feeling like I'm drowning for a few year, and then moving to a much better paying company.\n\nYou can totally do it. The opportunities are out there. You have a bunch of experience that is transferrable in one way or another.

So, I would work 10-12 hours in the restaurant and go home and go through tutorials for another 2-3 hours or until my forehead pounded into the keyboard. Get up early and do it all over again. \n\nAfter about 10 months, I had heard about the \"coding interview\" and decided to apply for a couple jobs to see what it was all about knowing full well I wasn't going to get the job, but I would be better prepared for the interview when I really was ready (another 6 months to 1 year of self-learning in my estimation.) \n\nI did a phone interview with a HR person, then a second interview with the CTO, who invited me to an in-person interview at the company with the \"team\". \n\nThe in-house interview apparently went well where I told them that I still Google almost everything. They looked at each other and said they do, too. By the end of the week, I had a job offer making 4x what I was making as head chef.  \n\nCompanies need new blood. They need new talent. There's always turnover. If you can handle the brain drain, you are an asset at any level of experience. Hell, I remember when I got my first cooking job and the chef asked if I had gone to culinary school. I answered no, and he said good, I'd rather teach you the right way to do it. \n\nGet enough knowledge to get in the door. Take advantage of any mentoring offered.  Continue to grow your knowledge. You will be a valuable asset. \n\nBtw, 5 years later I was running my own team (a different company) making 3x what my first tech job paid me. \n\nThe best thing I can say is put in the work, but go for it. Don't be timid and unsure if you are ready. Let them decide if you are ready. And always be looking for the next gig. People get raises when they change companies. Although I stayed with the same company (second hire) for 5 years, I could have advanced my career much faster being open to other opportunities.

Wrote my first own programs at 14-15 and took care of any electric/it device in friends and family area eversince. Also i am affine to big data and complex processes, so i had good prerequesites for all of my current job.\n\nAfter cancelling the car mechanic thing i wanted to study software development and get a job there. Unfortunately i was late for the application timeline regarding finding an employer to educate me, so i didnt find a job in software stuff. To avoid beeing unemployed and also to make some money while finding my place i worked in a logistics site near my hometown. Started as a picker/packer and got offered studying logistics there. It was good fun and i got a good offer compared to my anyways bad situation so i took it. On the same day i started my official education their new one-man-show it guy started his job too. We became friends and he tought me a lot of stuff. Starting with special excel skills (smaller VBA stuff, complicated formula, data analysis, controlling etc) over basic SQL functions and also hardware related stuff. I learned a lot from him and got even better regarding IT stuff.\n\nWhile corona things got messed up in the company. Leadership changed the new CEO didnt like me personally so he mobbed me out. As i had taken care of the warehouse management software that we used there i applied as a software consultant at the manufacturing company of the software and got emloyed there. Things went really good. I learnt a lot about software development and got involved in interesting projects, learning a lot more and deepdiving my skills regarding SQL, C# development, general understanding of software and software pricipals. After the company got taken by investors i got fired for budget shortenings, but luckily one of my former customers - again a logistics company hired me.\n\nNow i am the Head of IT Solutions for a 400headed company, running 4 logistics sites in germany and am taking care of IT topics for over 100 customers from various goods vendorships. We are running 10 Serverd, over 1200 data interfaces which we are creating by our own with a low code platform. I create wonderful and powerful IT solutions in any thinkable way. By configuration, development (C# mostly), and also by orchestrating different service providers.\n\nI earn a fair amount of money and am responsible for 4 people + myself, everything i achieved was by glorified hobby skills and a lot of self discipline.\n\nAlso i have never hesitated to work in my spare time and go the extra mile, well knowing that probably no one would ever properly be thankful for it, but look where it took me. \n\nTL;DR: if you\u2018re into IT and have a good skillset for your target market.. go for it dude. You can do it!\n\nAsk me anything if you want.\n\nBest",

Personally, I'm more of an Azure/365 proponent because it encompasses a larger userbase and is a little easier to break into from starting at near-zero, but that's just me.\u00a0\n\n\nAny entry level AWS training will give you a leg up over those who are just trying to stumble their way into an entry level role. The nice part about entry level training is it shows you the scope of what is available for next steps and that lights the way to your path in your new career. So will it work? Yes. Will it land you an entry level position? Possibly. Will it make your career? No. You need to finish the entry level work and then follow up with a more advanced cert that will get you ahead of the under achievers. That, coupled with experience, will get you your next 20 years of work, ideally, remotely. The more you specialize, the more you will get paid.\u00a0\n\n\nHopefully this helps.\u00a0",

People see AWS and Azure certs and think they're the answer but apart from very basic certs they are actually designed to be taken by people who experience working with those cloud services. So by studying anything more than AWS CCP or Azure AZ-900 you're not really helping yourself become employable in an efficient manner.

        "content": "I'm a former software engineer looking to make a switch into IT. I have 2 years of coding experience, but I got laid off in June 2023 and have had no luck making it back into the tech space. I'm pessimistic about the current state of coding as a career, but AI can't put together a physical computer setup or tell people how to fix a computer problem (yet), so I'm more optimistic about the IT space.\n\nA few questions:\n\n1. I'm looking to start applying to helpdesk positions, but I'm not sure what to put on my resume. I don't want to look \"overqualified\" or like I'm just looking for a temporary position if I put my coding experience on there. I have generic customer service experience, including a little bit of technical support, but it's been many years since I held that job. What should I put on my resume that will give me the best chance of getting an interview?\n2. I don't have any certifications yet, but I'm working with my state's workforce services who might be able to help me pay for anything I need in that area. Is it worth applying for entry-level positions without a certification, or should I wait until I have the paper in hand?\n3. I'm currently paying my bills by working as a bank teller, making $21/hr in the Greater Seattle area. I'm barely scraping by, and I'm seeing better wages even in entry-level IT job postings. The bar is pretty low in terms of finding a better job than what I have now, but that's my outside perspective talking. What is the general outlook on the IT job market?\n\nThanks in advance :)",

            "Hmm, I can only speak on my own experience here so take it with a grain of salt.\n\nI never did help desk but got my start in a NOC for an ISP through a contracting company for 17 dollars an hour in Louisville. I did this with 3 basic certs including the A+, I\u2019m not sure what that pay is equivalent to in Seattle, it\u2019s not super high here, but I could live off of it. My experience was that most people that studied a lot and moved up in my field had not only coding experience but also a wide variety on other IT topics. Now, a lot of people in help desk won\u2019t have that kind of experience, but I\u2019m not 100% your experience would disqualify you, I think it might even look good on you to show you\u2019re able to learn and you\u2019re actually interested in IT.\u00a0\n\nYou can go for something like your A+ but I personally think you should be able to find a job as an analyst or help desk without it.\n\nLike I said, this is just my experience and what I\u2019ve seen."

        "content": "Note: I have read the pinned post but want some more specific advice on my situation :)\n\nI am currently 23 years old located in California and will complete my associates degree in about a month or so in \"Interdisciplinary studies, Math and Science.\" The reason this is my associates degree is because my plan had always been to transfer to a 4 year university after community college, (all the classes I took in community college were gearing toward meeting transfer requirements and major prep courses, NOT towards an AA degree) and because of the classes I had taken up til this point, this was pretty much one of the only associates degrees I was able to get without taking a ton of extra classes. My major is in a field unrelated to IT, but up til this point I would consider myself a pretty good student (Pretty much straight A's).\n\nI am now considering a change in my career path from what I had always wanted to do. For context, I do not have much of an employment history. Since high school until now, i've mainly only done gig work, helped as a photographers assistant (they did school pictures and school events and I would help them with setup, setting up photos, etc), and currently I am working at the Angels Stadium (baseball fans?) as a merchandising associate. In all, you can see that in the 5 years since graduating high school I have not done much. I have been in school on and off during this time and just changed paths so many times and I am pretty ashamed of all the time I have wasted. All i have to show for the past 5 years is basically some retail/customer service jobs and gig work, a pretty broad associates degree, and no certificates or certifications.\n\nI was thinking a ton about this recently and while doing some research I became interested in a field in IT. I read that help desk jobs for IT are a good entry level job for those who want to get into the field of IT but don't have a bachelors. I am very much interested in a career in IT and from a lot of things i've read, Help desk seems to be the \"entry level\" job of the IT world, please correct me if I am wrong. Because I do not have a bachelors yet, i've heard that MOST help desk jobs are interested in a **CompTIA A+** certification. This is something that interests me because with school almost ending and summer coming up, this is something I can study for on my own and possible get certified in while still working as a merchandising associate. My questions are:\n\n1. Would it be worth it for me to try to pursue a CompTIA A+ certification because of my lack of experience and formal education in the field? My main goal would be to get an entry level help desk job with this certificate, would the certification really help? \n\n2. **OR** is there other types of entry level IT jobs where they will train me and I wouldn't need any type of certification or formal education?\n\n3. Is the CompTIA A+ certification the best type of certification to get in my situation, where i'm willing to take ANY job that gets me into an entry level IT job? Or are there other types of certifications I should try instead.\n\n4. Lastly, will the CompTIA A+ certification do anything for me once I do get an entry level IT job? Will it help my career further down the line?\n\nThank you if you read through this entire post and i appreciate any responses. I will try to get back to everyone who gives me advice.",

        "content": "I want to make a career change at my current age of 30. I went to school back in 2012-2018 but because of me having to work while at school, not enjoying or taking school seriously, and lack of motivation/focus; I never finished any degree. If I remember right, in that time I only officially completed about 35-40 credits of classes that were \u201cpassing\u201d, although I\u2019m not sure what my total credits taken was. \n\nRight now I\u2019m working in a factory at a great company that I really like and would like to stay at, but just move within different departments. \n\nI\u2019ve always liked computers, and IT but I\u2019m not sure what I necessarily would want to do. I\u2019ve dabbled a bit with programming doing a bit of Python, C#, Swift and when I mean a little bit, I mean a little bit. I also did a bit of HTML/CSS back in the day and even made myself a [shitty website](http://www.tylerwarnecke.com) that I haven\u2019t updated in years. But I had a lot of fun doing it. \n\nI also have half of my COMPTIA A+ done, Core 1 done in August of 2022, and just kind of slacked off on getting the other half done. Part of that is I\u2019m primarily a Mac user and don\u2019t have a Windows computer to use to test things directly on. So any recommendations on a decent Windows laptop to start out on would be great. I want a laptop because I can\u2019t build my own PC right now. \n\nI haven\u2019t decided if I want to take online guided or self taught courses (like Udemy or Udacity) or enroll back into school, but then I don\u2019t know if I would do online (like WGU) or a traditional school like my local tech college. I feel like with online schooling I\u2019d get distracted, and lack the motivation and help to complete it, but with traditional school I feel like I might do better because I\u2019d most likely have to go in person and physically be there. But regardless I fear that I might end up in the same situation as I was a decade ago. \n\nAnd advice would be greatly appreciated",

            "The short route, finish up your COMPTIA stuff.  This should give you some basics and some ability to do some things.\n\nNobody is going to hire you if you can't do anything that they need.  Nobody is going to hire you just because you want to work in IT.\n\nWhen you interview, you need to be able to tell/show them what you can do for them.  Oftentimes, experience can prove this.  If you don't have any experience yet, that's okay.  You will need to convince them that you are trainable, you are eager to learn, and that you can do the job.  Educational experience with a certification or degree can help prove this.\n\nGood luck !",
            "Acer Swift 3 is cheaper and reliable. Amazon sells used ones for under 600 I think. As far as moving up in your company, you will want to determine what you want to do. IT is a very large bubble encompassing many departments. Learn more about those specific departments within IT and figure out which of those you want to go into. From there, research what employers look for and go after it. Talk to HR and show you are making these efforts to move up into that department of IT within your business and see what they would want from you/if they need any positions filled. IT is great because there are many specifications. For example, if you want to get into the network side of things then you can work on the Security+, Network+, CCNA, and more. Programming itself has some cool certifications. You might have to start lower on the totem pole (help desk) but getting your foot in the door is everything.",
            "I saw you like your current employer, but based on your situation, I'd suggest looking for entry-level positions in local government, small non-profits, and schools, especially elementary schools. \n\nLocal government positions will often allow you to substitute experience for education or credit hours, even if you have not finished the degree -- *call and talk with their recruiting or HR department to find out specifics.* Also, since the government pays less than the private sector, they tend to have to be more open to indirect hires (i.e., people like yourself who may not have all the specific skills or experience yet).\n\nSmall non-profits tend to have small budgets so, as with goverment, they sometimes have to be more open to taking a chance or being flexible with their hires. Depending on your free time, you could also potentially volunteer and gain some experience with IT that way.\n\nFinally, I specifically say elementary schools because they often have a simple IT setup, which means their entry-level position requirements can be less strenuous. Also, the education sector still loves Apple/Macs, so being more experienced with macOS helps you there.\n\n---\n\nOn a related note, before you interview, I encourage you to have a simple and honest explanation for why you did not complete your degree and have not gone back to finish, at the ready. It's reasonable for an interviewer to ask, and a simple honest answer is the best route, in my opinion. *Also, sometimes an interviewer may press you on your answer, rare and rude, but it can happen, so be ready for that with a simple response.*\n\nI'm not saying you would be that blunt, that you lacked focus and motivation, but that response will hurt you in an interview. I would consider presenting along the lines of \"*I was working and going to school at the same time and was getting worn out with the workload and costs, so I put the degree on hold.\"* Based on what you said, I feel like that is honest (although I don't know for sure) and, if I was interviewing someone, would accept that as a reasonable answer."

One thing that sets everyone apart is notes.  Take notes, ask questions.  So many people in IT I\u2019ve encountered and they do not take notes.\n\nI would start with basic networking possibly Network+ understanding network infrastructures, LAN, WAN Subnets, etc.  A+ certification, understanding OS structure and functionality for Windows, its Registry, Services, Drivers, Command Prompt, Settings, etc.  good to know and basics of Mac and Linux as well.\n\nTruthfully, I\u2019ve encountered many with certifications and degrees that still don\u2019t get it.

            "I got my degree in Computer Science, graduated summer 2020 in the middle of the pandemic. Wasn\u2019t able to get a job in software engineering so I started to apply for low level IT jobs, took me 8 months but I had no experience except working at BestBuy while in school which I wrote off as working at geek-squad on my resume.

Left that after 1.5 years and now I\u2019m an IT engineer for a global financial company and make over 100k. My advice is to focus on something in IT because it\u2019s such a broad field but once you are in you can hop around since you pick up things from different fields. If you are starting from scratch get your A+ and networking+/security+. Then you can get a low level gig and go from there. I\u2019m almost 3 years in with some Microsoft certs and I\u2019m currently working on my CCNA. I have recruiters on a weekly basis reach to me for interview even while not looking for jobs. \n\nTLDR: get your A+ and pair with security+/Networking+ and you can land a job fairly easily.

        "title": "The Rise and Fall of My Career in Refurbishing Computers",
        "content": "For nearly two decades, I dedicated myself to mastering a skill that, in the grand scheme of things, doesn\u2019t seem to matter anymore. The journey started in my mid-20s when I had a gaming computer built\u2014a machine I absolutely loved. One day, a virus brought my beloved computer to its knees, and I had to call an IT technician to fix it. He spent about 30 minutes at my house and charged me $90. I was stunned. That moment planted a seed in my mind: *I have to figure out how to do this myself.*\n\nI wasn\u2019t starting from scratch. My dad and grandpa had always been into computers, so I wasn\u2019t completely clueless. Still, I was far from a tech expert. That didn\u2019t deter me. I discovered that local recycling centers were selling old, unused, and broken computers, so I bought a few laptops and desktops to experiment with. I spent months tinkering with those machines, figuring things out through trial and error. Slowly but surely, I taught myself how to fix them.\n\nOnce I got the hang of it, I began buying more computers, refurbishing them, and selling them. It turned into something big\u2014a business. Over the years, I became incredibly skilled. My business grew, and I hit milestones I never thought possible, including selling over a million dollars\u2019 worth of computers. Over 20 years, I repaired, built, and refurbished more than 50,000 machines with my own hands. I became so familiar with computers that I could diagnose issues just by their smell.\n\nBut success came with a cost. Eventually, burnout set in. I decided to close my store and took a job refurbishing computers for another company. I did well there, boosting their profits by over 500% in just a few months. Despite that success, the grind caught up with me again, and I moved into IT helpdesk work.\n\nThat transition was humbling. Even though I\u2019m excellent at troubleshooting computer issues, I found myself at the bottom rung of the IT world. I didn\u2019t know much about cloud systems like Azure, Active Directory, networking, Office 365, or email configurations. All the years I\u2019d spent perfecting my craft\u2014refurbishing and repairing computers\u2014suddenly felt obsolete. In this new world, those skills didn\u2019t hold the same value.\n\nToday, I\u2019m in my mid-40s, working as a helpdesk tech. When someone has a genuine computer problem, I\u2019m often the best person in the company to figure it out. But that expertise feels like a hollow victory. It\u2019s a reminder that even being the best at something isn\u2019t always enough if the world no longer values it.\n\nThe moral of my story? In your younger years, invest your time in building skills that will endure and translate into long-term success. Don\u2019t waste decades perfecting something that might become irrelevant. I\u2019m older now, with no clear path forward, but I\u2019m holding onto hope that I can find\u2014or create\u2014a new opportunity.",

Ties really well with 2fa and AD.\n\nSpeaking of which, you also want to enable 2fa if you don't have a system in place already.  It kind of depends on the nature of the business and size of your company if you deam it's worthwhile but IMHO it completely is. Something like DUO or even tying the accounts to Microsoft/Google authenticator. It only takes one phishing attempt to be successful to hold an entire company hostage and as far as threats, phishing is the most common. \n\nYou're not so deep where you're going to need an entire active directory database but utilizing Veeam to make sure you have data recovery tools in place would definitely be an avenue I would pursue for a network drives. \n\nMicrosoft offers MDM services. I work with InTune and it's a little convoluted sometimes but very effective and once you build groups/locations it actually makes things very easy. Tons of videos on it on YouTube.\n\nMaking sure your 0365 subscription also covers things like cloud storage. Not all packages do. You don't want someone to drop a computer and lose everything with no reliable way of recovering the information.\n\nKind of out of pocket but get the company to subscribe to a Chat GPT account. It's like 20 bucks a month and I use it every day but more importantly, my team members use it every single day. It has helped me code, figure out software issues, and hardware troubleshooting. \n\nGood luck!!"

We also keep track of the copious amounts of Software licenses (Microsoft admin, Adobe products and numerous other vehicle maintenance applications such as Cummins insight, Allison Doc, Wabco, etc.)\n- Microsoft Exchange/Azure Admins\n\nI started this job in January of 23\u2019, and since then I\u2019ve had 3 different managers, 10 new employees (normal team size is 6), and witnessed multiple cuts to the network teams. \n\nOverall I feel super lucky to get to work with this many applications.

You'll still make similar money being in other roles of the IT realm if being social is not for you.\n\nI don't get summers off since we've exploded in growth so a lot of work to keep up with that. My first year was sporadic summer work when I was told there wouldn't be any. They paid me extra for those projects. They then converted me to a generous salary and title change after it didn't make sense to pay me hourly in the middle of May 2020. COVID accelerated the need to grow our tech capability. Every year has been getting new projects and upgrades completed. I've established SOP's, Help Desk ticketing system, internal alerts, remote assistance, network upgrades and documentation. Used an excel sheet for asset management. Migrated us to cloud-only M365. Introduced Chromebooks 2 years ago being managed on Google Workspaces EDU. Banned MacOS to narrow down SKU's and 1 less OS to deal with. Added Prometheans to the mix for each classroom. Introduced PoE switches and just pay Comcast Business for VOIP services.\n\nCreated a Device Replacement Cycle sheet for annual budget management the first year. This made leadership trust me with a six-figure budget that has far exceeded what I started with ($0!). They see tech keeping up with the growth. It's really become a visual sales tactic for new families that come do tours. Made backups of backups of backups. 2 cloud services, hard copies, and localized server. This saved me during a catastrophic event earlier this week where we lost $150k+ of equipment. The nice thing now is they're finally allowing us to hire 2 more FTE's this summer for support, if the acquisition happens. If not, just 1 more FTE.\n\nMore than happy to grow. It challenges me. When it's slow and they know I've worked long hours, they are okay with me \"working remote\" doing nothing without requesting time off. Still get to use my vacation in addition to that perk. So it's a lot of work sometimes but when things are working, I get to work from home or go out anywhere that has internet so I can be alerted immediately when things go awry.

Be very aware you are dealing with people that may not have a lot of IT knowledge.  \n\nSome tips from almost 25 years in K12 IT after an 18 year stint in the private sector\n\nComing from industry where 4 letter words were often heard and opinions flowed freely was a major change.  Choosing your words carefully is important.  Being politically correct is almost a way of life in a school, while you may really feel x politician is a (insert choice word) or y law is a huge mistake, keep those thoughts to yourself.  Even if other staff try to engage, its better to be non committal.\n\nNever make staff feel stupid because they had a power strip shut off or a book sitting on their keyboard.  My go to response in that situation is always \"I love an easy fix, makes my day a bit better\"\n\nBe nice to everyone, you may think the administrator/principal runs the building, but it is the secretaries and custodians that can make you life a lot better.  Or worse.\n\nStandardize everything.  After being there and establishing yourself as a knowlegeable and reliable IT Pro, start making the case for why you should go to a standard device for teachers and one for students, except for very specific cases.  The reason should never be because its easier or better for IT, it should be based in reasons related to eduaction.  IE, \"with Chromebooks for all students its a uniform learning platform, if there are questions often students can help each other with the device providing more time on learning\" or \"All staff will have (Insert type) laptops with docking stations becuase it standardizes the classroom, allows us to have spares on hand for substitutes, allows us to keep a few on hand in case a teacher one breaks which will minimize downtime for that staff member, ensure less disruption in the classroom, etc\"  It is bonus points if you can also tie this into budget savings.\n\nFor large projects dont be afraid to bring in outside help.  A phone system for 4 locations is not deployable by one person in a day so ask for assistance.  Explain your goal is to transistion as smoothly as possible and having this help would do that.  Look to local colleges for students looking for intern hours, ask your local high schools if they are interested in setting up a student helpdesk to assist with device repairs, etc.  Being a one man shop doesnt necessarily mean you have to do it all on your own.  \n\n0$ IT Budget is not sustainable.  I would research what they teach, what the state standards are, and look to other districts in the area.  Push to establish a baseline that will only grow.  Everything that happens in a school is now at least somewhat IT connected.  The physical building safety and security (Alarms, phones, building card access, security cameras, HVAC, Energy management, etc) almost all require connectivity and computers to run.  Teachers use technology to communicate, build lesson plans, take attendance, take lunch counts, print assignments, project lessons onto a large screen display or projector, etc.   Office and Admin staff use technology on regular basis, most state reporting can only be done online.  Even our cafeterias have a touchscreen POS system for selling lunches and they use tablets with an online software program for dismissals and parent pickup at the buildings.  We have a visitor management system that scans ids when some one comes to the buildings.  I could go on for an hour on this, but yes, make them see that point.  \n\nWhen coming up with a budget proposal have specific education based reasons for the items.  \"I need new wifi access points for x area to minimize dropouts which disrupt learning\"  or \"I need a new backup for our SIS and on prem data to ensure if we get targetted by ransomware we have our data protected and can be back up and running with minimal downtime\".  Also, ask for a reasonable amount more than you need.  It will likely be cut so it doesnt hurt to have a few wish list items that are justifiable but not necessarily critical.  Assuming this is in the US. look into making use of e-rate funds.  If they dont, they should.\n\nCommunicate everything that might impact staff, even if you see it as trivial.  Staff may see you as the enemy if you try and make changes for what they percieve as no reason.  For example, as an IT pro, you see and know the value of 2FA for security.  Put that into place with few warnings and no explanations and it will be fought against and you will be in a bad spot.  Explain it, ask for volunteers in each building to try it, take their feedback, then enlist the voluteers to help roll it out and you are setting it up for sucess.  In a commercial setting you can mandate and expect compliance, in a public school you need to tread a little lighter.\n\nSet up a ticketing system, get people to use it.  If you are fixing something on your own, put in a ticket for yourself.  If you help a staff memeber that didnt put in a ticket, put one in for them.  This will help document everything you are doing, show the need for additional resources (time over the summer, part time help, replacemetnt devices, etc), and allow you to prioritize.  Generally I am on my way to or from a meeting or to fix an issue if I am in the halls in one of our buildings.  I am often stopped to ask for help with other issues.  I explain (very nicely) that I am on my way to help someone else and if they could put in a ticket that would be great because I will likely be stopped by others and wont remember eveyones issues by the time I get back to my office (or closet as many school IT locations tend to be).  As a side note to this, also document the hours you work.  If you find yourself working 12 hour days as I did the first few months, make yourself cut back a bit.  Keep those notes as justification for the resources mentioned above.  \n\nStaff may be frustrated if something is not working and hasnt been fixed in a long time.  They may choose to take that out on you.  Dont take it personally, smile, fix the issue, and move on.      they will see you doing your best and even if it not vocalized they will appreciate the effort.\n\nAs final thought, while my pay may not be what I could be making in industry, I love working in public eduation.  It is a people business and I have found that the staff are cared about as people, not numbers on a spreadsheet.  I will never be called at 1am on a Saturday because our website is down and we are losing 1000s of dollars an hour in sales.  I have a great work life balance and a really good retirement pension when I do retire.  It works well for me.  \n\nSorry for any spelling mistakes, alternating between this and some dfs errors in our file share.",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to share a bit about my career transition and get some advice. I\u2019m 27 and I\u2019ve spent the last 4-5 years working in the TV industry and in the past couple of years started working as a camera operator, and while I love what I do I\u2019ve recently realized I need a change. Work is becoming more and more difficult to find and I\u2019m feeling burnt out from constantly searching for the next gig. My goal is to leave the TV industry behind, move out of California (to be closer to my friends and family), and find a stable 9-5 job with benefits so that I can stop worrying about where my next check will come from and start building something for myself. \n\nTV production is all I really have experience in, but I\u2019ve always been passionate about electronics and have been tech-savvy since I was a kid. That\u2019s why IT seemed like a natural transition for me. After applying for a couple hundred jobs, I was offered a position as a low voltage technician, where I\u2019ll be installing and troubleshooting CCTV and access control systems. Since I\u2019ve been struggling for most of this year I hopped on the opportunity and accepted the position, excited at the prospect of learning something new and earning a stable wage.\n\nWhile I\u2019m excited to start this new job, I\u2019m worried that low voltage work might not have as many connections to the broader IT field as I initially thought. I\u2019m planning on going back to school as well, which I think will really help me transition fully into IT, but I\u2019m not sure if low voltage is the right path for that.\n\nHas anyone else made a similar switch? How did you find your way into IT? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!\n\n\nTL;DR: I\u2019m transitioning from camera operating to IT because I want a stable 9-5 job with benefits. I was recently hired as a low voltage technician, but I\u2019m worried it might not be the best path to IT. I\u2019m planning to go back to school to help with the transition but would appreciate any advice on making this career switch.",

            "So I made this switch. I used to work in Hollywood then moved back home and started working as an Event Tech at the college I graduated from. Then I started working as a Multi Media Spec, and finally I left. The first thing I wish I had done sooner is getting the Sec+ (this will get your foot in the door) and opens up a lot more possibilities. Don't be afraid to start as a Level 1 Help Desk tech and move your way up from there. To mention the one thing that saved me was I had taken a course in Airwatch (its called something different now) and when I applied this other company they literally hired me because of it."

To give you a bit of background, I\u2019ve completed my BCA(Bachelors in Computer Application) and am now in my 2nd year of MCA(Masters in Computer Application). I\u2019m exploring job opportunities and have found an opening as a RAN Engineer in the telecom industry, which seems like a great start in terms of gaining technical experience.\n\nHowever, my long-term goal is to transition into the IT industry, specifically into cloud-based roles. I\u2019ve been working on building relevant skills in cloud computing (I\u2019m AWS certified cloud Practitioner) and have a strong interest in roles like Cloud Engineer, DevOps, or Cloud Architect.\n\n**My Concerns:**\n\n1. **Skill Relevance:** I\u2019m worried that starting in a RAN Engineer role might not align well with my future goals in IT. Will the skills and experience I gain in telecom be transferable to cloud roles in IT?\n\n1. **Transition Path:** How can I best navigate a transition from a telecom-focused role to an IT cloud-based role? Are there specific skills, certifications, or experiences I should focus on while working as a RAN Engineer?\n\n1. **Career Path:** Has anyone here made a similar transition from telecom to IT? What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them?\n\n**Why I\u2019m Asking:**\n\nI got the RAN Engineer job through campus selection and accepted it because I couldn't land a job as a fresher in Cloud, core IT, or SDE roles. While I\u2019m grateful for the opportunity, I\u2019m concerned about being pigeonholed into a niche that might not align with my long-term career goals in IT.

It sounds like you were not doing anything more relevant to cloud work before the RAN job, so no harm there IMO. \n\nYou can surely transition to cloud work when you are ready, and I think it's easier than you imagine. Work on some professional certifications, whether that be AWS, GCP or Azure. Look for some roles opening up that fit your experience - whether that be Junior Engineer, Operations, perhaps a helpdesk hybrid type role...\n\nI'm sure if you can get a few baselines certs, and get your foot in the door and show your passion for cloud and what you have learned it will take off for you."

        "content": "I don't know about y'all, but I have become a bit disenchanted with the industry. Admittedly, I began as a full stack developer during a high point, mid 2020 and I never imagined things would so quickly take a turn for the worst. I can't even log into LinkedIn without having to come across a bunch of posts about layoffs. \n\nWhile, I haven't been impacted yet, I have developed a somewhat adversarial perspective towards employers which I didn't really have before.  I genuinely feel an anger and distrust towards companies and employers and hate what they've done to my fellow devs. I am working through that as I don't want it to fundamentally change who I am. \n\nI am taking steps to manage my angst by now taking very seriously the advice, \"A Leetcode a day keeps unemployment away\"  and I'm actively interviewing, just in case. I don't love that I have to be in this state of paranoia to work in this industry, but I love the lifestyle it affords me so I'm willing to do what it takes to stay ready so I don't have to get ready. \n\nWondering how my fellow devs are coping,  especially those who have only worked in tech during a bull market, do you feel yourself also becoming disenchanted, bitter or paranoid?",

            "I was the one doing the layoffs, and it's noticeably changed my perception of the industry.\n\nI spent over 20 years making games, where the pay isn't great and the hours are long, but people keep going out of passion for the work. Then I went to FAANG, where the hours were way more sane, the pay was 3x higher, but there was still all this talk of mission, caring for employees, and culture, and long-term investment in people's success.\n\nYes, on one hand you realize that it's a business, that corporations have no soul, and that at the end of the day it's all about money. That's just logical. But after \\~25 years of it *not* working that way for you or the teams you manage, it becomes easy to forget that, and assume that's only the case for other -- dare I say \"lesser\" -- places to work. A certain arrogance sets in.\n\nSo much for that, eh?\n\nAfter 8 years of building teams of hundreds of engineers at FAANGs, and bending over backwards to respect and reward and grow them to the point that even during the Great Resignation, my yearly attrition rates were <0.5%, along comes Wall Street and the c-suite and tells me I need to summarily fire 10%+ of them with about two weeks' heads up. Via spreadsheet. I didn't even get to decide who. Everything was reduced to a number.\n\nWhy? Because our profit margin fell from billions of dollars to slightly less billions of dollars. Heaven f\\*&ing forbid.\n\nI still intend to treat my engineers like actual people, and try to shield them from this soulless stupidity as much as I can, with the obviously limited-but-still-considerable power that I have. I'm not going to succumb to cynical self-interest. But I don't ever trust anyone above me to feel the same way again. Turns out the people at the very top of these companies are just as mechanical, heartless, and dishonest as everyone always told me, and I didn't believe them.",

There is a boom and bust cycle, but an entire generation of tech workers only ever experienced the 'Boom' part. \n\nThe sky is not falling, this will pass. If it feels like you were safe before but now you aren't, all that has changed was that you learned that that 'I'm safe' feeling was just a false sense of security. \n\nSorry, but this is what white collar jobs look like in literally every other industry.",
            "It hasn't really changed my impression much.   I joined the industry in the early 2000s, companies have always had hiring sprees and layoffs.     \n\n\nOlder tech companies like Oracle, Microsoft, IBM, Cisco, HP would regularly cull divisions every couple years.   Sometimes good employees would get wacked, sometimes they'd dodge and get recruited to another team, sometimes you're unemployed for six months etc.    \n\n\nEven when FAANG emerged as the super awesome place for devs to work, Amazon, Meta, G, and Netflix would regularly manage folks out pre-pandemic.  Sure some folks could coast depending on your manager, but it wasn't guaranteed.   I knew people who lost their jobs at those places before the layoffs, just like I know people who got rich from these companies.\n\n\nI guess what is surprising to me is that so many people came into the tech industry thinking it was a magic industry that was guaranteeing riches, perks, and job security...",

Nothing about what is currently happening has changed that. I've been laid off before; it sucks. That's why I live below my means and save a lot of my salary. It's gone up 5x from what I started at, and I'm still living in the same house I bought 6 months into my career.

Remember there are lots of people [outside of this industry] that think $20/hr is a good wage because they have never seen that much at a job.  Maybe people are realizing that even though you are in this field you are just an employee, and your only value to a company is increasing profit or stock prices.",

Sure, theres more anxiety now, but this too shall pass.\n\n My contract was timed badly and I've maxed it out, so I'll be out of work soon for now.  \n\nIn the meantime I'll be ready to either pivot jobs as necessary while practicing coding and making projects to get back in when I can. \n\nCycles happen, always be mercenary with your work, but in tech, its possible to make so much that its easier to save for rainy days than in other industries.",
            "So I got laid off in January while on paternity leave. At the time I was looking forward to having an easier year while dealing with lack of sleep. Of course, I had to scramble to interview. It was an exhausting cycle of last-minute prep followed by long technical rounds. Luckily, I was able to land an internal position by the end of February. I\u2019ve kept the same salary and benefits so I\u2019ll consider myself luckily but my workload has increased.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely changed my perspective. I had been employed for nearly 2 years with the company and told I was safe before leaving for paternity leave, so I hadn\u2019t even thought about interviewing or prep. Now, I think I\u2019ll do at least some prep every 3 months or so. Also, as some others have mentioned, the job market for Jr. and entry level positions is almost non-existent. I have friends who have recently graduated or have 1-2 YOE applying for job after job with no success. I had no issue getting interviews (specialized field, 7 YOE) for mid and senior level. I think it was in part due to having contacts/recruiters at other companies. If you are applying through websites you\u2019re unfortunately one of 50-500 people. \n\nOverall, I think this is all just getting started and even though I have a new job, I\u2019m not going to be considering myself safe for a long time.",

Secondly when layoffs did happen they let go whole teams that had services that were deeply integrated with teams that were left. They offered 0 transition plans and the people at the bottom were scrambling to try to even inventory the systems that would need their support structure changed. It was the basic fucking responsibility of the people who decided to do layoffs to ensure business continuity after layoffs and they just didn't fucking do it. Did they seriously think nothing would happen if you got rid of whole teams and just left their services rudderless without telling other teams what their new responsibilities would be?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm biding my time, looking for something else but needless to say this has left a sour taste in my mouth.",

I'm guessing that there is some regulatory reason to do it this way.\n\nThe problem is that it's sending a message that performance and seniority and product may not matter, and this lack of security and lack of allegiance affect motivation.

So if they can lower their cost through layoffs, offshoring, AI (no code tools), merging with other companies etc they will do it. \n\nProviding jobs, & careers is just the cost of doing business, incidental to the goal of the company. So we as workers just need to find the best fit & become as valuable in our current or new employers. And we need to save n live below our means when times are good, bad times always come. Markets are cyclical and always changing. We need to stay on top of current trends and tech, always be learning. Remember how Detroit economy collapse when car manufacturing went off shore, coal mining jobs gone etc \nJobs move, shrink in one area expand in another.\n\nI have been a dev in several roles, for over 20 years, I was a Jr Dev during the dot com bust of 2000 that was a masacre, way worst than it is now it felt like the world of IT was ending. I knew some Sr Devs & DBA\u2019s that could not find a job for a year during that time, I was a Jr Dev hardworking with domain knowledge I got lucky since I was cheap during that time but I have also been though a few layoffs either companies completely shut down or merged or got acquired n  getting laid off always sucks, throws ur plans out the window, sometimes it depletes ur savings, sometimes you take a salary cut, sometimes u work in a supermarket to make ends meet in the meantime. \n\nBut one of my early layoffs, it opened the opportunity to buy my first home ironically, I managed to find a job with in 5 weeks n with my severance package I had enough for a down payment on my first home (a townhouse).

I don\u2019t take my salary for granted now and I\u2019m definitely going to cut my spending back by a lot.

            "I think you should distinguish between **tech company** layoffs and other industries. Most other industries are barely touched by layoffs. The problem with big tech is they over-hired and over-paid, based on absurd long term growth projections that were unsustainable, not too different from the Dot Com Bust of the early 2000s.\n\nThe software development field has stabilized. But there is something seriously wrong with the management (or I should say, the **investors**) at Big Tech though. They sold Gen Z a bill of goods and lied to them about the proliferation of jobs and money in this field, and after a huge surplus of developers entering the field it's now contracting back to where it should have been in the first place.\n\nIt's a bad time to be inexperienced and trying to break into this field. The competition for entry level and internships is fierce. I do not envy at all. And if it were me I'd probably go back to school for an Engineering degree (which was my original major). Engineers have no trouble finding jobs, and they have the best salaries around now.\n\nIf you have development experience, there are a **lot** of jobs out there right now. Recruiters are calling me daily, the most calls I've gotten in 20 years, and they are almost all remote jobs and almost all paying more than I make. I have senior friends who have been jumping jobs at will the past year. And they are raking in the dough.\n\nBut I would be careful about just blaming \"employers\". For the most part employers just want to run their business and earn a profit. They're not out to get you. If they are not hiring, instead of insulting them you should try to understand why and figure out what they *are* hiring for. My manufacturing company brings in lots of Engineering interns, experienced Engineers, and hourly labor all the time, because the business is doing well. What they are *not* hiring is any software developers, even though we badly need more. Because they are just too expensive and the company has decided they aren't worth the cost for what they get in return. So that means that every project is now being slowed down, delayed, shelved, or canceled. So we just have to make do.\n\nHowever they are hiring IT people, probably another 5-10 by the end of the year. But they have stopped hiring developers. Financially if you do the math, you can get 3 -4 IT people for the same cost as 2 devs. So that's what they are doing.\n\nBusiness budgets are all about priorities and return on investment.",

A job is never guaranteed, and thinking you'll always have a job because you're a \"good boy\" and hard worker is an ignorant belief. Even in good times companies can go through restructuring or the owner can want to sell and the new owners can come in and cut out half of the current work force. \n\nAlways always always have at least a 6 month emergency fund. Before making any kind of large purchase make sure you are in a very solid financial position to do so. \n\nNever get attached to a job or company. When it comes time for layoffs they'll let you go and say something along the lines of \"we really like you but this is just a business decision etc\". \n\nA job is just a job. It doesn't define you.

It _could_ help in specific jobs that need both medical and technical knowledge, but you'd be very limited if you only looked for those jobs vs just any developer/IT jobs.\n\nBest thing you can do is start self-teaching the basics.  Do some tutorials on Python, learn about databases and writing SQL, try setting up linux and learning some command-line stuff.  See if any of that actually interests you.  I don't think you need to \"love\" coding or be super passionate about tech to do well in the field, but you definitely have to not hate it.\n\nAlso be ready for an uphill battle.

I'd assume you're already also pretty familiar with the regulatory side of that industry -- HIPPA, the FDA approval process, et al. I try to avoid that side of the industry because I really wouldn't want someone's life to depend on my software, but based on the other programmers I've met in the past three decades, I'd much rather my life depend on code I've written rather than code they have.\n\n\nIf you want to use that obvious \"in\", maybe contact companies doing medical software.

It might be better to instead focus on learning the core fundamentals for whatever CS path you want to take.

            "I had pretty bad undiagnosed ADHD in college. I was smart enough to pass with pretty good grades in high school but as soon as I got to more difficult subjects I struggled to have good study practices and my learning style did not coincide with how colleges typically do things. Frankly, I just do much better in an office setting with real stakes and products.\n\nAt my first job, at a small company, I was mentored by the director of software engineering directly almost daily for 2 years. He did extremely in-depth code-reviews on my PRs, challenged me constantly, and most of all, believed in me when I didn't think I was even worthy of it.\n\nA few years later after being promoted and looking for new jobs, I accepted a new offer at a relatively well-known company (where I currently work). I get beaming performance reviews, my manager entrusts me with absolute autonomy and I'm the go-to person for code review and front end design across my department.\n\nIt truly was about _getting the support I needed_. I have no idea where I would be without my first mentor, but I know I wouldn't be as successful as I am. I think about how grateful I am for him and how lucky I am almost every single day. A lot of it was also about _getting to know myself and the type of person I am_ (I'm very fucking weird in a lot of ways; highly ND), and from there I could take steps towards investing in myself and growing. My soft skills are pretty good, so being able to leverage those to build relationships in the workplace has also helped a lot. That contrasts pretty heavily with how the school system works.",
            "i almost got kicked out of school. my gpa sophomore year ranged from .667 to 2.0. depression, drug addiction, alcoholism. went through a lot of therapy and eventually graduated\n\nonce i got a job, i coasted and was running in place for about 8 years being a shitty employee and not learning anything and doing just enough not to get fired. i spent all my free time and money training brazilian jiu jitsu. i was replacing one addiction with another (albeit) healthier one\n\naround that time my uncle died and i had to find a flight the same day to make it to the bay area where all my family was. it was really hard doing that, and i realized i needed to move back home to be near family. so i told myself i needed to get a job in silicon valley\n\ni learned how to be fanatical about work ethic through jiu jitsu. i really learned how to grind through unpleasant tasks, maintain a growth mindset, and set goals on timelines that lasted years rather than months\n\ni looked at a job description for a data engineer in silicon valley. i didn't check a single box except for knowing SQL, but that list became my guide. i spent the next 6 years moving company to company and studying in my free time, looking to check off each box. i didn't know anything about AWS/GCP, agile, infrastructure, CI/CD. didn't know how to write python, didn't know what orchestration was. i grinded the shit out of leetcode throughout that whole time\n\nfinally when i felt ready, i quit my job and studied and interview prepped full time for 3-4 months while living on a friend's couch. i got rejected by every job offer and was starting to run low on money when i finally got an offer. not faang, but was a big tech company in silicon valley\n\ni had a lot of help along the way from a few mentors who guided me through this process and told me to be patient. i had a lot of luck too. and a friend with a couch.\n\nit wasn't easy, but it's been a fun ride. i'm up for a staff promotion right now (fingers crossed)",

Got kicked out of college for grades. Went back and finished at 29.

I have a great job by most people\u2019s standards, but when I compare myself to classmates who are in the 0.01%, it\u2019s a reminder that I\u2019m probably not as smart as I thought I was and that\u2019s okay",

            "I was put on academic probation sophomore year of college and that forced me to get may act together junior and senior year. Was never really driven in school ever (didnt strive for scholarships or high marks in highschool and didnt know exactly what i wanted to do after HS. Every uni I applied to i applied for a different major.)\n\nUniversity was my first real experience to coding and I've been working professionally as a SWE for about 5 years now. \n\nI probably have a similar story to you honestly LCOL area and honestly for a large part of my life making $15-20/hr probably would have been enough for me in life.   \nIt wasnt until around my junior year of college and me seeing what some of my peers were achieving(Like winning hackathons/getting internships in big tech/etc) That I realized how little my world view actually was and how much I was missing out on.\n\nYou are very much capable and the fact that you are working and motivated now is proof of that. Remember that comparison is the thief of joy but sometimes its a good measuring stick for where you are at. Yes some of your coworkers/peers may have went to high tier schools or have a strong academic background but you have to remember you are literally in the same room/spot as them. The only thing really separating you is your history. \n\nUse the drive and motivation you have, continue to explore and upskill yourself and forever learn. You are not where you are at by sheer luck alone. Its okay to live in your success you earned it.",
            "My background is not quite LCOL, but I was definitely a late bloomer when it comes to education and career progression.\n\nI had good enough grades in high school, despite my poor work ethic, but it was very much a \u201cbig fish in a small pond\u201d situation. The raw talent was enough to get me to college (top 10 ranked overall) but once I got there, raw talent could no longer cut it, and you will run into people who not only are more talented, but also more motivated. \n\nI struggled with depression also, and played counter strike and WoW most of my time awake. I ended college with a 2.8 GPA, and was put on academic one semester for falling below 2.0. \n\nAfter college, I spent a lot of time improving myself and learning work ethic.

            "I was a pretty C student. Autism and ADHD certainly didn't help. I got Cs and Ds in math  from 1-12th grade, then through my 100, 200, 300, and finally 400 level courses. But I made it through. I liked technology, but in school never really had the passion for it many of my peers did. Couldn't bring myself to work on a bunch of personal projects or program in my spare time.\n\nFor me the passion came later.  As I got into my career and started to love what I was doing I eventually gravitated back to the algorithms and data structures study that had been so hard in college. And it was just so much EASIER now that I had context and interest. And the foundation of knowledge school had given me, combined with having actual industry experience, really set me up to be able to truly understand and embrace the concepts that were once very boring and difficult to wrap my head up around.\n\nNo one ever asked for my GPA (maybe one or 2 internships did). I became an expert in many technologies. For a long time I carried imposter syndrom, as there were always engineers who just seemed to be experts in SO MANY things. And the, one day...I was the expert everyone came to. It really caught me off guard.  \n\nWhile focusing on something I wasn't interested in had always been difficult, on the job there was always SO MUCH that I could really pick and choose. There was always SOMETHING to excel at that caught my interest. And it turned out I was very much a big picture thinker (something my ADHD really helped with). I was naturally gravitating into leadership positions so I eventually decided to develop leadership and management skills intentionally. I spent many years as a consultant which helped a lot. Worked in startups and big tech and eventually decided companies making the transition from small to mid sized was the sweet spot for me.\n\nIn hindsight, school just was never going to be a place I thrived. The stakes were intangible, the knowledge to divorced from reality, and things were just too ridgid. Though I'm still eternally grateful for my CS education. And in my career I've found that many of the personality traits that were problematic for school were actively helpful in my career. \n\nSo don't worry about it too much. We all change a lot in our lives, and school is not a great predictor of career success. It's such a different environment than business. \n\nAs a society I think we focus too much these days on STARTING with passion for a career. Passion can develop naturally with mastery.\n\nThe last thing I would say is...don't romanticize \"big tech\" TOO much. They really don't generally select for the best of the best, and most of the work is really not THAT interesting. They select for good and safe. If you really want it I'm sure you can get in some day. Not right now, the market is awful. But once you have some experience your school and gpa really don't matter. For the past 10 years what mattered was your ability to communicate and solve algorithmic problems in 30m or less. Before that it was brain teasers, looking the look, and being \"passionate\". I'm sure it will be something new in another 10 years.\n\nIt's just another job at a big company that pays in the 80th percentile. Which is good, but not the mythical unicorn many make it out to be. The biggest thing that sets big tech apart isn't the quality of their employees (which is above average, but not amazing), the pay (which is very good, but not the best), or the work you do (which is mostly pretty boring stuff that very few people ever see). It's the fact that they are easy to point to and hire a LOT. \n\nI've worked at some amazing places, but I couldn't give ANYONE advice to go and work at those places as a career path. They employed less than 40 devs, come on. What made them amazing was that their needs lined up with mine and the timing was right. It was the team, the need, the leadership, and the market all lining up.\n\nWhat makes big tech special is it's predictable. Not that it's amazing. You can tell someone, \"If you want to make X per year then study these things, work on these skills, present yourself in this way, and apply to companies X, Y and Z every six months. You have a 90% chance of achieving those goals within 3 years.\"\n\nWhich is great, don't get me wrong. I'm REALLY not knocking it. If you lived in the area they were hiring it would be a very solid plan.\n\nBut don't get the image in your head it's some sort of amazing achievement or a place where you'll work with the best of the best and the most amazing and fulfilling projects. They're just nice, predictable, stable, big corporate jobs with solid, above average pay. A good place to trade time for money and feel secure in your retirement.",

            "I was roughly an 80-92 student in terms of high school grades. Never the best and never the worst. I got anxious and stressed easily. Some high school courses were harder than college. Did not finish college. I had a bizarre problem throughout high school and college where I was passionate about the science courses I took (biology, chemistry, physics), I genuinely studied, but did awfully on tests which were the majority of the grade. It was really disheartening to like something and yet do so poorly. For other courses I will admit I had an inconsistent work ethic. I would study to exhaustion for a history class, then fail math because I had used the time for history. Then I would be behind in math and have to catch up rapidly. Whatever I did never seemed to work. It was like when one thing got better, the others would get worse.\n\nAs an adult I have a better and more balanced work ethic. Work isn\u2019t like school. School doesn\u2019t let you revisit past work. School doesn\u2019t ask for your opinions on implementation and actually do the implementation. School requires you to make things on the deadline or it\u2019s failed. Work has more flexible deadlines, work asks for opinions, etc. Oddly, school is set up in a more difficult way than work. A lot more of us would be PIPed if work was more similar to school. \n\nI worked customer service in Big Tech for about 2 yrs, then got promoted to a very junior project manager + very junior analytics role. Then I was promoted to an actual business analyst role after about 2 yrs. Then moved on to another mid size tech company after about 2.5 yrs in a much more technically demanding analytics role. Spent 2.5 yrs there and quit earlier this year. I qualify for Sr Analyst roles, I get a reasonable callback rate, and ace interviews pretty easily. I would have never predicted this outcome based on my high school and college self especially because I don\u2019t have a degree.",

            "I\u2019ve failed plenty of times and ate shit a ton at school mostly because my learning style wasn\u2019t a great fit for my school (I had crazy variance in more grades mostly based on how well I could understand a professor).\n\nMy internship and my first job wasn\u2019t anything special, around the average for my city. But it was really hanging out with a couple of people who went to big tech and realizing that we\u2019re all just regular people that kind of \u201cunveiled the shroud\u201d of working at cool companies with great compensation.\n\nMost people working in the FAANGs and Unicorns of the world are just regular people who knew what to study and what to learn.

This is amazing and takes great discipline. You may not realize, but the ability to do this is actually more important than anything you learn. This is a _meta skill_ that you'll continue to do for the rest of your career. You are already ahead of so many people that haven't strengthened this skill yet.\n\n>  I haven\u2019t looked at my CV for quite a long time and I don\u2019t know where to start trying to update it. \n\nNo worries, put your certs you've gotten this year, list the main technologies you're familiar with, and some projects you've done. _Keep it to 1 page._ The CV / resume's only job is to get an employer to pick up the phone, so while this may not seem obvious, you only want enough information on the CV to peak their interest.  A clutter-free CV with plenty of white space is your friend.\n\n> Second question is about LinkedIn and what should I write as a headline\n\nIf you're doing web development, just title yourself as a Web Developer. Do *NOT* put \"aspiring\" or \"junior\" on your CV / LinkedIn. Let an employer decide how junior you are or aren't.\n\n>  Lastly how I prove what I know as I don\u2019t have a degree and self taught?\n\nThis is done holistically through your CV & projects. Also, I would think about keeping a blog to do some \"public learning\" e.g. blogging about things as you learn them. This also re-enforces what you've learned simply by teaching it through blog posts.\n\nI'm sure you've already done this to get to the point you're at now, but be sure to watch plenty of tutorials on your particular stack / tech, and podcasts help too to absorb the lingo so you can speak with authority. \n\nBest of luck OP!!",

A lot of juniors are understandably thinking \"I don't really care what I do, I just need that first opportunity.\" Which is perfectly understandable, but the more you can 'brand\" yourself as a particular role the more likely you will be to get opportunities in that area.  \n\nDon't be afraid to do have multiple resumes that communicate different things.  For example, have a resume that is targeted specifically for listings where skills/portfolio match the job opening well and you've done your market research to know you're competitive vs the \"shotgun resume\" you're going to send out to every software company job listing regardless of how well the role matches just as an outside chance.  \n\nAlso take a bit if time to prepare yourself for coding interviews.   Take this sub and all the others with a grain of salt because it's a bunch if hyper competitive over achiever types with crazy young adult anxiety, but you should at least have enough knowledge of the interview process that none of it comes as a surprise to you if someone starts giving you a leetcode style coding test.",

            "You're going to need a bit of a non-traditional CV. So you should list the skills you are proficient in: Algorithm design, runtime analysis, data structures, etc. Maybe even with a breakdown in between.  \n\n\nYour previous work experience is probably going to be useless. So, instead, list your most impressive portfolios under a \"Projects\" section and describe them as if they were your job. \"Designed and implemented CRUD interface over a *<insert other technologies>* UI with a focus on User Experience\" ... stuff like that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLeave off an education section unless you have education beyond high school that is somehow relevant or at least a bachelor. If you've attained a bachelor's degree that at least shows you're capable of working.\n\n  \nWhen you start a serious job search, it wouldn't hurt to have internships, either. They are generally easier to get, but usually harder to get for non-student types. So, landing one would give you work experience, which is gold. Work experience on your resume is more important than any other thing you could put on it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast, as you're a female (and this is totally screwed and I don't condone it, but it's the situation as it is) you need to focus on appearing feminine in a professional, non-flashy way. That means do your hair flat, practical and proper, don't wear many non-neutral bright colors, light on the make up, no excessive jewelry and keep your jokes light and professional (you don't want to appear \"bubbly\", because many sexist folks equate \"bubbly\" with \"airhead\". But you also want to appear personable). Job markets are sexist, unfortunately. It's not nearly as rampant as it used to be, but you still don't want it hurting your chances.   \n\n\n  \nLast *lastly*, good luck. What you're doing isn't easy, but it's totally doable with hard work and discipline. You will hit serious road bumps that look like brick walls. But, they're not. Work around them, even if it means a bit of sacrifice. One thing I figured out having a child while making a career: It sucked for him in certain ways. But he has now grown up seeing first hand what it takes to make a career if you don't follow the proper steps/get it right the first time. Moreover, he's seen an example of what it looks like to want something and GO GET IT. It's really an invaluable lesson that is rare for children to see first hand. So, when you feel guilty about sacrificing time or inconveniencing your children, just keep in mind that you're also teaching them a lesson that's very, very difficult to teach: That aspiration means changing your life and sacrificing small things for long term reward and if you get hungry for something, the only thing between you and it are the decisions you make and time.",

But, you don't need a degree to schedule an interview. You just have to work harder than those with a degree.\n\nObviously this is glossing over the fact that you could be auto-rejected without it being listed on ur resume or in your application. But there are ways to get an in, and personally I think the best way is through referral. It might even take a referral in a roundabout way, not just simply someone attaching their name to your resume in a referral system. Literally, \"hey <friend name>, i saw this opportunity on the careers page, do u think u can send an intro email with me and the hiring manager/recruiter?\" This can get your resume to the top of the pile.\n\nBut it means nothing if you don't have any work to show for it.

        "content": "Apologies if this has been asked many times before but I was hoping to get some insight and opinions on a career change that has been looming over me for a while. \nI\u2019m currently a contracted PM that boomerangs between tech companies, once my contract ends I find another one. \n\nRegardless, I\u2019ve been intrigued with programming and possibly becoming a dev or SWE of sorts. I dabbled a bit with HTML web design at one of my roles 4 years ago and honestly I loved it. \nI\u2019ve been doing some very minor HTML at my roles ever since but it isn\u2019t the main premise of what I do. I personally would love to be more involved in a role that just focuses on some kind of programming. \nI\u2019m thinking of leaving the PM life as there hasn\u2019t been any growth and several cuts in the last couple years. Not to mention severe burn out. (That\u2019s a rant for another time). \n\nMy questions are, what is a good place/way to start learning a programming language and getting into the field? \n\nWill I need to obtain a certificate? \n\nI have noticed several \u201cschools\u201d and boot camps that offer certification. Are there any free resources to be self taught or would a class be more sufficient?  (Money isn\u2019t an issue but prefer not to go back to college) \n\nI do know that I\u2019ll have to create a portfolio but honestly I don\u2019t know where to begin. \nI would absolutely love any insight that isn\u2019t just a google search and having sponsored ads about what school is better. \n\nMy background: \n\u2022 bachelors in communications. \n\u2022 Google analytics certification\n\u2022 lean six sigma certified \n\u2022 PMP Certified\n\nTLDR: \nLooking for a career change, what do I need to become a SWE or web dev or sorts. I\u2019m self taught in some HTML that I was able to use in previous roles. \n\nUpdate:\n\nThank you everyone for the information! It seems that the dev jobs are roughly in the same boat as the PM jobs. PM jobs have been cut down significantly in the last 2 years and project teams have been reduced quite a bit. It\u2019s been extremely difficult finding any PM or PC work lately hence the thought of changing to a different career path. ",

            "I do have a different opinion not focused on the market. First, learn to code. If you can and you enjoy it, know that working for a paycheck doing it will drain some of the enjoyment. So, with that out of the way, look into a Computer Science degree. You may even be able to completely one fully online. If this is not an option then I would start working on a portfolio or building and launching your own apps. Regardless if you do a CS degree or not that's a good way to start.\n\nAfter that it's just a matter of getting your foot in the door. The easiest way is to join a consulting or development shop that makes websites and apps for clients. The pay is low and the demands are high but that's the easiest way to get into software development. Two years there making apps over and over for clients will give you some really solid experience. From there on the sky is the limit. You just have to always be learning new processes, technologies and keeping up to date with the industry and trends. The people complaining here saying there are no jobs are correct, but that may (or may not) change in a year or two, or more. The people here also complain because they can't easily get a job paying 150k+ a year anymore at big tech, not because they can't get a job for peanuts in a sweatshop (at least not yet) but that's where you'll need to start unless you are extremely luck and talented at the same time.\n\nMore likely than not, you'll get stuck in the first step and give up. That's usually how it goes. If you can't learn to code on your own with all the available resources out there online then this field is probably not for you. HTML is not coding and not representative of the field of software engineering but it is one thing you should know if you work on the web.",

(That\u2019s a rant for another time).\n\nCould you expand on this a bit more? Your experiences might shed insight on those wanting to do a PM job in tech. Thanks!\n\nAlso, if I were you, this is the plan that I'd follow (we are basically in similar situations):\n\n* Look into certificates on Coursera and/or Edx. Learn from here and start building a portfolio.\n\n* Similar to the above, check out theodinproject.com, freecodecamp.org, fullstackopen.com, and roadmap.sh\n\n* Study algorithms and data structures. Check out /r/leetcode and leetcode.com and start grinding right now. If you enjoy this, also check out janestreet.com/puzzles\n\n* I haven't actually looked into it myself a whole lot yet, but consider the [O'Reilly Online Learning] (https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/individuals.html) service. They have a lot of good books so it might be worth having access to all of them. \n\nAnd finally, as other's have mentioned\n\n* Consider or plan for a master's degree in CS or something related. Good options for people that can't take time off exclusively for school: UT Austin's Online Master\u2019s of Computer Science, Georgia Tech's OMSCS, Harvard Extension School Online CS (very expensive but you'll be an official Harvard alum after completing it (not a HC alum mind you)). Start by taking online community college CS classes to get accepted into UT's or GT's program(s). \n\nThe market is brutal right now. So unless you have special connections or a very impressive resume, it will be very hard to get interviews. You are already starting off disadvantaged without a CS degree. It will be even harder to get an offer after you start interviewing too. \n\nOnce you start interviewing, aim for non-remote jobs as those are less competitive. Aim for rural or non-tech centered locations. Aim for non-profits or government jobs as the competition for those jobs isn't as high compared to big tech or finance. If you have another citizenship, consider looking for work outside of the US too. \n\nGood luck!\n\nedit: added more",

Combining all of the previously mentioned, you're looking at potentially 40-50 rounds before a solid offer (4-5 companies). To rub salt in the wound, compensation has notably lowered as well as the market becomes more saturated with supply of engs, and obviously job security has plummeted.\n\nSpeaking strictly on just the interview and job hopping process, tech is rounding out to be the worst of all careers from this aspect and it's incredibly annoying.",

I love rambling, especially to help people.\n\n**TL;DR** test the waters and see if you like it, if you like it make the switch but please please please keep your expectations within reason!\n\nFirst of all, great job on what you have accomplished so far! You are clearly smart and a hard worker so I'd say you have an aptitude for this. Between you and me, I would kill to have 175k as an accountant, it's an extremely stable career with straightforward growth whereas with cs right now we are sort of in a hyper tech bubble (though it might not pop for a while!) May I ask how chill is your day to day and if you find your self being \"bored\" (this is a plus to me lol) I would find both equally as boring too be honest since to me a job is a job and a means to live life. Programming to me gets soul-crushing after a while since it's less about being creative and more about just busting out tickets and doing what you are expected to do. Programming is something I love but the whole corporate aspect of it is something I'd never enjoy.\n\nAnother thing to note is the reality of these salaries and how competitive the field is for entry-junior level. Most people dont actually make close to 175k starting out so it might take you a little bit to reach back there. But if you can get into big tech and study your ass off for the interviews it can be possible to get there eventually especially since you live in NYC (but again this is top % of people, reddit is just it's own bubble with people who have these jobs getting upvoted the most).\n\nAll these posts you see about software being in demand they will hire anyone is actually for mid-senior levels who have experience already. The entry level market is super saturated with degrees, boot camps, and self taught people since it is a hot field at the moment. To put into perspective it took me months and hundreds and hundreds of applications after getting my degree (4.0 gpa) with internships to still land anything and some of my friends even took non-paying internships to build up experience (these are the guys who didnt do much in school though). The job market in NYC is indeed competitive but at least you wont have to deal with the lower end 60k salaries for the most part.\n\nNow going by the median for entry level and junior engineers (averages are skewd by super elite trading firms and big tech) you can still expect 80-90K all the way to 6 figures (for tech and fintech) if you put in a decent amount of work and have a solid portfolio. Even senior level medians are around 175-200K for most companies that aren't big names. Everyone is going to say im dumb and you can join amazon and google for 150K-200K+ right off the bat (this isn't a base salary but with RSU and bonus) but this is just simple statistics, only the top percentile works for these companies and that's not going to be a VAST majority of people. These interviews are both hard to get and pretty hard to pass statistically and for me personally super luck based, but certainly doable just don't expect EVERY job is like that. To explain why these interviews are hard just know that when getting a programming job you have to take a technical interview, sort of like a final exam for finals week which tests your coding skills with word problems of various difficulties. You have to set aside a good chunk of your day for these rounds, (mine was 4 hours). A lot of the time these problems require \"tricks\" and repetition to really know the pattern and know which tool to use at which times. I say it was luck based because the questions you get could be the same type of question (similar algorithm used) you crammed the night or even the hours before.\n\nI wouldn't quit my job right away til I had a decent job lead after finding out if you really do like this and want to make the switch. The main important take away is to see if YOU would like it. Make sure you actually do a deep dive and not just do basic coding 101 things and think \"this is super easy, I love this.\" Trust me every beginner coding tutorial is going to make you feel like a child can do it because the beginning is purely snytax and easy logic! Honestly, if you want I could DM some of the best textbooks (for free dont worry) to help you with the most important part of CS which is the actual algorithms portions.\n\nAs for not going back to school, you certainly don't NEED a degree in this field with enough projects and hard work but the degree itself does make it easier to get an actual interview in a sea of candidates that all decided to go into the CS major (it is the fastest growing major). Bootcamp was and can still be a decent path but it became a bit saturated where the actual certificate doesn't mean much. Some of the better known boot camps (using the HR bootcamp as an example) have gotten less and less placements over the years so I personally would try to self-study as much as you can (online resources provide just as much structure as a bootcamp these days) to see if you like it rather than dropping the $20K.\n\nIt is 100% possible to make a switch but as for if it's \"worth\" is really up to you! If you're in it for more money / challenging work you could also see which career paths you can branch out from accounting that will give you an easier time switching as well, but if you fall in love with programming it can certainly be worth to switch. The hours depend on the company but usually it can be pretty chill. As a matter of fact I would rather have a low challenge, more autopilot which is why i'd love a \"boring\" accountating job where I just grind out hours and make money while doing other stuff on the side. So when searching for companies I usually look for the ones that are \"boring\" (rest and vest) and I can chill out. But places like AMAZON will pay you a TON of money if you pass their interview but you'll end up working hard for 10-12+ hours a day if you are in AWS. The reason people pick AMAZON over something like lets say GOOGLE is faster promotion (google seems to low ball your skill level to get you a lower pay if you're mid-senior level), and AMAZON hires (and fires) more people yearly compared to the other FAANGs so you'll see people who didn't get into one of the others go there."

            "** Passers-by should read the comments under this one. Good discussion.\n\n*** A lot of people are mentioning that Trilogy stinks. Honestly, you can find such opinions/warnings about literally every bootcamp. They are as numerous as the bootcamps themselves.\n\nJust my experiences after doing this for ~10 years, and finding myself in a management role. They're not gospel.\n\n> At this point my goals are working from home, 9-5, Monday - Friday, no weekends, no holidays.\n\nThis is not an unreasonable ask, in my experience.\n\n> With the pandemic I know many people went from office workers, to work at home. Is this likely to continue? Or is there a large push to return to the office?\n\nThere is a large push from corporate leadership for \"return to office\". I don't have a crystal ball, but I'd bet on the companies that are pushing for \"return to office\" getting their way. Companies that were remote-first before the pandemic will probably remain remote-first.\n\nAny position that is fully remote is going to be ***incredibly*** competitive compared to any given on-site position. You will be competing with the best of the best for many of those spots.\n\n> Are the hours consistent yet flexible?\n\nThat's going to depend on specific corporate cultures.\n\nI get to be pretty flexible with my team. Peers/friends at other orgs, not so much.\n\n>  I\u2019ve read people often times work early or late based on their own discretion.\n\nI would not use \"often\" to qualify that arrangement. Most companies are going to have \"core hours\" during which all of the synchronous work (alignment/planning meetings, pairing, etc) happens.\n\n> How many hours a week is normal?\n\nSome figure less than or equal to 40. \n\n> Or is there a lot of forced overtime?\n\nOvertime isn't usually a thing in typical product development focused teams. [SRE](https://sre.google/)/DevOps/Ops flavored roles can involve on-call rotations. I rarely hear about anything as nuts as the 70-80 hour weeks I hear about in bedside care. Those sort of \"sky is falling, all hands on deck\" incidents happen maybe once per year at my company. YMMV.\n\n> How important are the degrees and certifications in this industry?\n\nBootcamps can be a viable alternative to those lacking in the time or money to pursue an undergraduate program. I cannot provide you a list of \"the good ones\" -- bootcamps are not accredited, very wild-west. If you have an existing relationship with a college/university that offers a [Trilogy](https://www.trilogyed.com/) based program, those are generally OK but come at a premium. They are absolutely not a replacement for an undergraduate program. \n\nThere are some companies, particularly those who pay top dollar, who will not give you the time of day without a completed CS/related undergraduate degree.",
            "It\u2019s doable for anyone with the tenacity to try. \n\nThere are a few things to consider before making this decision. Namely, the entry level market is flooded. Whether new grads, bootcampers, or self taught devs, getting your first gig will not be easy. Your best chances are at a place that has poor reviews and churns through developers (a \u2018beggars can\u2019t be choosers\u2019 mentality will go a long way). Then, stay long enough to get experience that will bolster your job search and income. In 3.5 years I tripled my initial salary. Also, because the market is nuts, remote jobs will likely be harder for you  to come by. You have to be realistic, Will a company hire you with no experience or someone else you has moderate experience for the same amount?\n\nAnother caveat that I\u2019ve recently discovered is that while a lot of places are now offering remote positions, if you\u2019re in a HCOL (which is the case for me), remote companies will pay what is relative to their market. For me that\u2019s a 40k discrepancy. \n\nIn regards to hours, the places that I\u2019ve been at have a general \u201cbusiness hours\u201d but my direct managers have been flexible with my schedule. One gig allowed me to work from 6-2, which helped me beat the DC rush hour. Getting up at 5 was worth the 4 extra hours in the afternoon that I got to spend with my family. \n\nAs for degree, bootcamp, or other, I\u2019m self taught. I would love to go back to school and get the brick and mortar stuff, but it\u2019s difficult to find the time and now that I\u2019ve been in the field for almost 4 years, it isn\u2019t really necessary. Though I didn\u2019t have much flexibility in the path that I chose; I left a job and was out of work. A degree was too expensive and would take too long and a bootcamp was also too expensive for me. In total I spent less than 2k to teach myself enough to get my first job and that included 1100 for a new computer. The longer you wait, the more crowded the market will become. The most important thing you can do is start coding and learning and see if it\u2019s what you want to do before you make the life changing decision to change careers.",
            "It's viable. 9-6 is more common. You may have on call as well, but nothing remotely as intense as nursing at a hospital. I've never been a nurse. I just had the misfortune of needing them for a couple years. The ones treating me were at the top of the profession and make less than I do. A software job is much much easier IMO.\n\nMy recommendation if you have a bachelor's is to do OMSCS at Georgia Tech. A nurse likely wouldn't need leveling to qualify. You should obviously do some online learning to code courses, but you will have time before they admit you to do that. It's cheap, online, flexible and legit.",

You previous experience will handicap you (most of the times). You are already an experienced, accomplished professional - you wouldn\u2019t tolerate a lot of the BS associated with starting out in a new career (job interviews in software dev markets are truly insane, like asking an OR nurse about organic chemistry with a lot of things we would consider unprofessional in healthcare setting). \n\n3.

            "My mom was an RN - she worked in as a nurse consultant for insurance companies on complex claims and really only ever worked those hours. She would also frequently show up late and take a lot of days off work. Before embarking on a whole new field - you may also want to consider going that route. My mom got a work from home job doing that in 2001, though it didn't last for very long and she didn't really enjoy it that kind of thing is possible within the nursing field. \n\nIf you really want to do something entirely different, by all means, but I am still struggling after 2 years to really break into the software dev career as a former chemist so it really isn't an easy road even with a strong work ethic and STEM background- especially if your goal is wfh and regular hours you would  have an easier time finding that within your own field.",

Find the names of the vendors who make those products (or their competitors if they suck) and go look at the skill sets they are hiring.

            "I\u2019m a RN learning the MERN stack right now with the help of my fiance who is a SWE. Therefore, I don't have any advice as far as whether a degree vs bootcamp is better. But I just want to say I so resonate with the burnout in nursing. \n\nI know a lot of people here are saying \"the money is good!\" Or \" go travel nursing!\" But I TOTALLY understand where you are coming from. \n\nI've been a nurse for 6 years and I'm done with caring for the general public. Nursing is a damn hard job that some people (like myself) are not cut out for in the long run. I can't fathom doing this for another 30+ years. Covid is the cherry on top, when I got deployed last year to night shift covid ICU for 3 months, ratios were 1:3 or 1:4 in the icu, and management was canceling scheduled staff vacations. Oh and can't forget about the 1% raise and two tier pay system they tried to enforce on us this year, which we fought against and won (Thank God for unions). \n\nPeople who are not nurses don't and won't understand. For me, I even feel shame in calling in sick and refusing to work overtime. Even executing my exit plan to leave this career is making me feel guilty. I feel shame for getting annoyed by my patients who are so difficult to deal with (addicts, entitlement, demanding, verbally abusive, you know the rest..). As a nurse you see the best and worst in people. The worst rubbed off on me and I would carry that negative energy home. That's how much this job rubbed off on me. Again, this is case by case. Not every nurse is like me. Maybe I just need to not take it personally and grow some balls.\n\nThat's my personal experience with nursing. And there are days when I have really great patients. I realize that I have one life to live and that I want to have a career that allows me to urinate when I want to, work from home, have a full hour of lunch, have autonomy, be creative and heck, use my PTO that I earned! Anyhoo, enough of the negativity :). I'm enjoying learning about algorithms, data structures and specifically javascript for now. Hope whichever direction you take, you at least won't have any regrets not trying!",
            "If you have the time/money I recommend a bachelors over a bootcamp. Bachelors will give you the opportunity to get internships which make getting a full time job incredibly easier as well as build your confidence with software development. Second, taking the time to learn the fundamentals is important but it also sounds like it will give you a break from the nursing burnout, where as a bootcamp is incredibly fast paced and stressful and doesn\u2019t offer as much depth. Further, universities will open up feeder pipelines into big companies that hire lots of students from them, which is a pretty smooth transition into a first job. \n\nA lot of people are only focusing on money but aren\u2019t considering the cost of your mental health. Does traveling nursing make a lot more? Sure, but is it sustainable? You can make as much as you do as a traveling nurse as an SWE around mid-career if you are reasonably driven. It\u2019s not as if the entry level salaries at around 80k a year will leave you destitute. If nursing was your passion there are plenty of biotech and medical companies that would love to have someone with your background so you may even be able to skip right over the entry level pay bands. \n\nSide note: avoid hospital SWE jobs as they pay very poorly for some reason, I never understood how places like Cardinal Health have so much money but pay developers terribly.",

Or is there a large push to return to the office?\n\nThere is a large push to return to the office. Remote work is still significantly more common but there is a large push to return to the office. Pointless mid-level micromanaging terrors hate remote work. Lots of jobs are being listed as remote but are not actually remote.\n\n> Are the hours consistent yet flexible?\n\nVaries wildly.

I\u2019ve also actually found WFH to be more productive for me and have had no issue getting to know my coworkers online.

With the pandemic I know many people went from office workers, to work at home. Is this likely to continue? Or is there a large push to return to the office?\n\nA lot of this will depend on your company/industry. Some areas will be a bit more laid back. Perhaps places like government, non-profits. I assume non-profits don't pay as well, but perhaps you care more about **who** you work for vs other things like compensation. I've spent a lot of time in agency/consulting, and those types of companies can have pretty large spikes in hours. Things like poor planning, unexpected issues (think about some of the bug/exploits you hear about in the news, you might be responsible for patching Production and then going back to your original work). What happens if Production crashes? Depending the severity and your role, you might be spending a lot of hours trying to restore things. Probably the two biggest things that cause people to freak out is lives at stake and money. I'll let you decide which is more important, but there's definitely people that will vote the latter. Other companies, outside of emergencies, will be a lot more reasonable with expectations. You'll just have to see or research (and ask questions during interviews). My current job has been generally pretty laid back even thought it's consulting. It's primarily due to the client and the scope of work. I probably had 2-3 days since October where I worked really late into the night, but some of that was by choice.\n\nFor working at home, I think there will be considerably more full-time remote positions than there were pre-pandemic. A lot of companies are considering doing some type of hybrid approach whenever the pandemic ends. This might mean 2-3 days a week in the office. The truth is, no one really knows right now. Everyone is different. Some people love this. I've changed jobs twice during the pandemic, and full remote has made learning about a new company a lot harder. I mostly only know people on my project team, and I hardly got to know any senior and mid-level management. You don't get the incidental contact you used to. Some people are fine with this. I don't miss my commute, but it's definitely more isolating than it used to be, and I think career progression will be harder if you are fully remote. Some of that will depend on your company/team culture, though. I spent an hour speaking to a new person on our team, go over a the codebase on a video conference today. I spent another hour speaking to another engineer on the team, talking about some potential design/architecture options. I really enjoyed that, because most days, I've only been talking to people 15 minutes during a daily status meeting. Again, this will vary a lot from company-to-company, project-to-project.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Regarding pursuing this objective, I\u2019ve seen various discussions about university vs bootcamps. How important are the degrees and certifications in this industry? Would you recommend one or the other?\n\nIf you can afford it, my assumption is that a university program will teach you more. There are 1-2 year programs, I believe. One thing that really draws people to this industry, though, is the low barrier to entry. There are plenty of people who are self-taught or took a bootcamp. Entry level seems to be pretty competitive, though, as there are a lot of people looking to break into the industry these days.\n\nYour actual degree doesn't matter that much. In some cases, some companies will have an HR department that might filter you out if you don't have a degree, but once you're actually working, most people won't care. In general, I think people say certifications don't matter. The one exception I've been seeing (and some people have disagreed with me recently on this) are some of the cloud certifications. A lot of companies are pushing their employees to get these lately. For consulting companies, the more employees they have certified, they can get improved status with the vendor, and that can leads to projects.\n\nIt's a good field, there have been some bumps along the way. When covid first hit, some companies got hit \\***really**\\* hard, and there were actually websites tracking layoffs/furloughs. If you were asking this question in August 2020, a lot of people would probably say they really weren't sure what was going to happen. It rebounded very strongly, and most people feel pretty comfortable with things these days. \n\nGood luck, it's always scary (exciting?) trying something new. I hope you find something that works for you, even if it's not programming. Feel free to ask more questions if you have them.",
            "2.5 YOE here but talk a lot with friends at other companies and am pretty in touch with industry.\n\n\nI would say most work 45 hrs or less including myself (40 or less for me)\n\nThere are a ton of remote jobs now. It's honestly moving towards the norm since it cuts a lot of costs.\n\nRarely weekends except an occasional here and there.\n\nDegree is not really important for most positions and neither are certifications.\n\nProjects to put on your resume (and initially grades) will get you interviews. Talking well about those projects (design decisions, root cause analysis of defects, etc) and doing well in the technical interviews will get you offers. Although there are jobs where technical interviews are not very demanding so I wouldn't fret, you can initially shoot for those jobs, they still pay well, just not as well as the ones that wreck you during the interviews.\n\nFor a 35 year old that probably wants to expedite things I wouldn't do a bachelors. It's also important to provide how much CS or programming experience you have. Assuming you have none, I would\n\n1) self study a course or a couple . Let's say CS50 online + web developer boot camp in Udemy by colt steele\n\n2) after doing those, I would then think about the bootcamo\n\nThe reason is because you may not like it, and even if you do, a boot camp pace is way too fast to get a ton out of it with little prior experience. Taking those two courses before hand will make it more worthwhile.\n\nI personally wouldn't spend 4 years on a degree unless you can get it in 2 years due to previous BS. Then it starts becoming a competing option",
            "> At this point my goals are working from home, 9-5, Monday - Friday, no weekends, no holidays.\n\nI'd say there are a couple challenges to fully achieving this:\n\n1. Most jobs have at least a partial on-call component\n2. If you're new you're going to get stuck playing catch-up after-hours.  This will slow down if you're with it for a while, but you'll be starting from the beginning.\n\nIf you think you'd like programming, by all means, go ahead, but expect there to be some level of grind there.  Probably not as extreme as what you're used to but I'm not sure about reaching your stated goal.",

        "content": "I'm 42 and have been in the internal audit profession for 15 years.  I left my job without anything else lined up because they would no longer allow me to work remotely (I moved from California to Austin, Tx during the pandemic).  But for various reasons, I want to leave that profession behind and start something new, like learning to code. Changing careers is very high risk and scary (going into the unknown and starting from scratch) but I feel that coding is in such high demand I'm bound to find something.  Some factors to consider:\n\n1. I'm currently not working, so I have the time to learn.  I could invest 1 year into learning and finding a job.  I can afford this time off because I have savings. But I do need a land a job by the end of 2022, hopefully sooner.\n2. Obviously I know I will start at junior/entry level with much less pay than I'm used to.  I am hoping for 60-80K range with potential to go into 100-200K within 5-10 years (I don't really know these are just numbers I'm thinking). Being 42, I'm hoping I have around 10-15 years left in my working career.\n3. I don't want to go back to school.  I already have an MBA and CPA.  A CS degree is out of the question, considering cost and my age.  I would be open to a bootcamp if it is worth it.\n4. I currently live in Austin, but I plan to move to Houston because I have a lot of family there and  lower cost of living.  I would either like to find a job in Houston or find a remote job anywhere in the country.  I know Austin is a tech hub with possibly greater career opportunities and startups than Houston, but I have read that Houston has more tech jobs than Austin although focused more on the energy sector.\n5. I plan to determine whether I have an aptitude for coding by taking free courses over the next few weeks such as [https://www.freecodecamp.org/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).  As I said, I would be open to a bootcamp if it is worth it.  If I discover I like it and have an aptitude for it, then my plan is to move to Houston and start studying on my own (maybe do a bootcamp if it makes sense), and hopefully land a job within 6-12 months. If I don't have an aptitude, then I may just give up on this idea and starting finding a job in my old profession.\n6. I'm thinking to learn web development, front and back end.  I've heard that Ruby on Rails is a good language.  I have heard to learn a language I have an aptitude in, not just based on the demand. I expect that I would need to learn several languages though to be competitive.\n7. I feel I would have an aptitude for it because of my working and personality style appears to fit: I'm highly analytical and work well independently, cautious, systematic accurate.  I've been told by my boss that I'd be a good specialist and I'm a great individual contributor.  If you have heard of DISC profile, I am a \"C\" which is \"the Analyst\".  I'm also an INTJ.  I also bring to the table soft skills and management skills acquired from my professional career.\n\nI guess my question is if my plan above is decent, what assumptions do I have wrong, what am I missing/if there other things I should know or consider?  Thanks for any help, thoughts, feedback you can provide!",

            "Because you have degrees, a cs bachelors would likely only take 2 years (not having to take the general Ed classes). I\u2019d suggest just biting the bullet and spending the 2 years learning in school and applying for paid internships while you\u2019re there. Win win, you get paid work experience and get to learn properly. As for good languages to LEARN cs, c++ is great. If you can pick that up then languages you see at most companies will be easy.",
            "I\u2019m not much younger than you and I became a software engineer 2.5 years ago. I did a post-baccalaureate in CS in my late 30s. It was a very viable path for me. I started working as an intern 6 months before graduation. I earned back what the degree cost by the time I graduated. Then I converted to full-time at the same company. I\u2019ve been promoted since conversion because I am good at my job and a valuable member of the team. Maturity translates to better people skills than some young folks have. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to invest the time to learn coding well enough to do software engineering (and it\u2019s something that does take time), look at other tech roles that might be a good match for your skill set and experience: product management, product owner, scrum master, customer success, etc.\n\nETA: There\u2019s more to software engineering than just slinging code and the higher paid roles tend to be for quality engineers who can build a solid system and lead a team in a productive direction.",
            "I think you're a very strong candidate for career change, I don't know why the other responses are so negative. Your MBA, CPA, and 15 years of work experience are huge advantages that will rocket your career progression after you get your first job, and overwhelm your slight age disadvantage. The average bootcamp attendee has just an unrelated BA and 5 years of unrelated experience in their 30s, so you'll have a huge head start: https://www.coursereport.com/reports/coding-bootcamp-job-placement-report-2019. Yes, the entry-level market is tough currently, but you're living in the best entry-level market in USA right now.\n\nI think you have the right idea to get started. Target web dev, because it's the most friendly field for career changers. Take 3 months to dabble in free online resources like Freecodecamp: https://www.freecodecamp.org/, Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/, and OSSU: https://github.com/ossu/computer-science to gauge whether it makes sense for you invest into a career change. \n\nIf you decide to green-light your career change, then spend the next 6 months learning fundamentals. Enroll in a 6 month part time bootcamp to learn web dev and network. Spend the other half of your time self-learning data structures and algorithms, and grind Leetcode to prepare for technical interviews. You should just focus on Javascript for web dev and Python for technical interviews. It's better to be strong at Javascript and have no experience with Ruby, instead of being mediocre at both Javascript and Ruby. But if you really want to learn Ruby, then Odin Project has a Ruby track.\n\nIn any case, allocate the final 3 months for full time job search, relocation, and delay before the job starts, and you'll be set. Bootcamp grads need to hustle for job interviews more than people with STEM degrees, and bootcamp grads need to tolerate more rejection than people with STEM degrees. But at the end of the day everybody can get a job. Only about 50% of software engineers have CS degrees, and about 20% have some other kind of STEM degree. The remaining 30% is a combination of bootcamp grads and self-learners. Data here: https://hired.com/state-of-software-engineers\n\nThe main thing to be cautious about is that it might take more than 3 months to find a job. 3 months is just the average it takes a bootcamp grad to find a job, and bootcamps often pad their employment rates by offering temporary employment to graduates that take longer to find jobs. Sometimes it takes bootcamp grads 3-6 months to find a job, depending upon how picky they are about location.",

I am hoping for 60-80K range \n\nIt's definitely possible, but it's also possible you might have to settle for 50k a year to start.  Usually there's a quick increase after the first couple years though. \n\n\n>with potential to go   \ninto 100-200K within 5-10 years (I don't really know these are just   \nnumbers I'm thinking). \n\nDefinitely possible, but keep in mind that unlike many other careers that pay based on seniority, this industry pays for skill/capabilities.  There are people who have been professional programmers for 25 years who are making 110k and will never make more than 110k.  *shrug*  There are people who can make 200k after three years experience without a college degree. \n\nThere is no easy path to go from 60k-200k, it's all talent, hard work, and a little bit of luck.  If you are happy to put in the work and have a knack for it, knock yourself out. \n\nDo you *like* tech?  Because even if I could only ever make 110k I'd enjoy it, though I make quite a bit more.  I think it's a great career.  \n\nI think your plan is a good one, teach yourself to code, see if you like it/hate it, then eventually go for a bootcamp.  \n\nA previous coworker's path:  teaching degree, did that for a bit.  Went to bootcamp in late twenties/early 30s? Got a low paying web development job.  Got promoted.  Did that for ~4 years, got hired at a well known game company for six figures. \n\n\nAlso look at programming adjacent jobs.  Cloud Engineering, DevOps are both well paid, maybe a higher barrier of entry, lower ceiling, but hugely growing field and you are often *not* competing with CS folks for these jobs.",
            "I don't know what you were making before but I assume that it was over $60k with a CPA and MBA. If we assume you made $100k in your highest earning year, if you take a year off work to learn programming and it takes five years to get back to $100k (we'll say you make $70k on average as an entry level programmer without a CS degree), that's (($100k - $70k) x 5 years + $100k x 1 year) = $250k in opportunity cost. \n\nIf you have ten years left in your career after that, $250k/10 years = $25k. So you'd basically have to earn $125k/year, on average, over the final ten years of your career, to break even. That doesn't count potential bootcamp costs either. It's technically possible but it's pretty hard to justify this move from a financial or career progression perspective. You'd probably be better off learning in your spare time.",

With that said, I expect that I can ramp back up quickly\u2026my goal being to get back over 6 figures in about year-and-a-half. To help me with this goal, I am enrolled in an online university to earn a CS degree (WGU), while I also continue to get professional experience and grow as a developer. \n\nI feel fortunate to have found a job in this field and be transitioning careers at this stage of my life. I\u2019m currently on a hybrid work schedule, but I enjoy getting in-office a couple days a week to get in-person experience from more senior developers. My role has potential to become 100% WFH whenever I feel comfortable doing that.

Don\u2019t get discouraged, just do it. Your initial plan of action is fine, but it will evolve as you start figuring out what you like.

            "I would say if the current job has been killing you, do you really feel the money will help with that? Sure it's more, but you also know the job requirements of that role and you were already leaving because you didn't like it.\n\nThe other angle I'd personally view this from is to think, \"Wait, they can magically pull a 65% pay raise and sizable retention bonus out of their asses simply because I'm leaving?\" Part of that may be possible because of others who've left that, if they haven't been backfilled, they're offering you part of the salaries those folks gave up. But if it's not? That means you were being waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay underpaid for your role.\n\nIf you decide to take the money I wouldn't just take the money and call it a day. Sit down with your manager and any other stakeholders and explain your reasons for leaving and any changes you expect to happen as a result of agreeing to stay. I would also make sure the retention bonus doesn't have any sort of clawback hooks or a vesting schedule, and if it's the latter either get them to drop the vesting schedule or allow quarterly vesting of some kind. They're offering you more money, so get that money and make sure it's as permanent as possible as quickly as possible.\n\nFinally: remember, they're offering you this because you leaving is likely going to blow a pretty big hole in their department, so while it's in your best interest to make it worth your while, you're also \"marked\" and if they have to reduce staff for some reason you may be first in line for those reductions. They could be offering you this and all the while are searching for your replacement(s) with the intention of canning you once they feel they've found enough gullible folks to do your job.\n\nFinally finally: GET EVERYTHING IN WRITING. Whatever you negotiate or talk through, get that shit in writing and signed by the interested parties, and keep a copy for your records somewhere you have access to and they don't. Nothing counts for shit if it's not in writing.",

That\u2019s a month off, and a fresh start.  The reasons you are leaving the current place will remain the same or might even get worse because they think they can do that now that they\u2019re paying you more.  It\u2019s unlikely the reasons you want to leave will magically get fixed.\n\nHave you talked to the people that left?   What were their reasons for leaving?   Did they say why they were leaving to management, and did anything change for the better?  Unlikely.\n\nYou also have to think of the possibility of what will happen if this startup goes under.  The job market is rough right now, and it is unlikely the other offer you have will still be there.  You have better insight into that than anyone here.\n\n\nBiggest thing to remember:   We\u2019re just a bunch of people with opinions who have no stake in what happens.  You have to do what you think will make your life better.  Good luck!",

            "Yeah, I am not sure if I would take it. If it takes you giving notice to leave for them to do something then is it worth staying? Or is it just a critical time for them? Will the be so generous when it is not a critical time?",
            "I\u2019m not sure if I would stay at the same company, if it took you to put in your 2 weeks notice to get a raise and the fact they can afford to give 65% raise (which is very unusual) yet they did not give you even 10-20% raise after your teammate left. (Or did they?)",

Usually when you take a counter it doesn\u2019t work out well, but the I knew the people and they seemed mostly stand up and trust worthy guys and so I went with my gut instinct and it worked out. \n\nThis is something you\u2019ll have to figure out, so they seem stand up or they\u2019ll use you and then work to find your replacement?",
            "This just means they knew they needed you and were exploiting you.\n\nTake the new job. They are going to work you twice as hard if you stay.\n\nYour burnout will not improve. \n\nFuck startups. They all think their unicorns when they are just toxic hellholes",
            ">  My mental health has been killing me with deadlines\n\nDon't take the counter offer",
            "Guaranteed if you accept they will start looking for your replacement. They need you there 6 months til they figure out what to do. 25k is also peanuts",
            "I generally agree with the advice here but there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ll bring up in favor of staying - it seems like you\u2019re in the drivers seat at the moment. That seems like a very useful position you can and should leverage, especially if those 3 leadership people all jumped in to talk with you. \n\nNow it\u2019s one thing if the company culture just plain sucks, but you didn\u2019t mention anything about that so I\u2019m assuming you don\u2019t mind the people and overall environment. It sounds like they are really wanting to retain you and your skills, and sometimes they don\u2019t know until they get smacked in the face. I know people will say \u201cif they aren\u2019t already paying you and only reactively will upgrade your salary/position that\u2019s wrong\u201d but in startups it\u2019s easy to get buried since there can be very fast moving environments. \n\nIf you are considering staying with them I would negotiate the parameters of your job and be very clear about how it has affected your mental state. Make sure they know and can guarantee it. I\u2019d be asking about how they plan to tackle the cloud-related stuff or bring in cloud-specific engineers  so you can focus as much as possible on the domains you are supposed to be working on. Make it clear where you stand and that you CAN do that stuff but it\u2019s not what you were transitioned to do. \n\nI know startups kind of have the \u201cwear all the hats\u201d mindset at times but it sounds like your startup has some capacity to bring in specialized talent for some of the things - even in the small/mid-sized startup I work for (around 60-70 full time staff) there\u2019s occasional overlap but people tend to work in their lanes. \n\nAnd at the end of the day if they aren\u2019t willing to listen or the vibes are off, then trust your gut and move on.",
            "So I've done this before and it worked out for me. However, I will only ever do it once at any company. If they continually try to underpay (which most will) then I move on.\nIt's a tough call and only you know what you're willing to go through for the money.\nJust remember, you cannot get time back and your mental health impacts your physical health. Do what's best for you in the long run. If you think you can deal with it then take the payday, invest a bunch and then leave when you hit the wall again. Or do it now when you have good offers.",
            "Sounds like you have an opportunity to negotiate away some of your deadlines and Friday releases.",
            "Counter offers are not made to improve your circumstances, they are given to provide more time for the business to prepare for their next move.  The reasons that lead you to want to search for other work are still there, despite the extra money. It's incredibly naive to think they will give you less work for more money, they can promise all they want but you'll be asked to do exactly what the business requires, backend dev or not. If you take this, my money is on you will feel the same way after the excitement of the new money wears off, assuming they don't actively search for and implement your replacement at a lower cost (it's very likely they will).\n\nYou can always make more money, you can't make more time. Explore the new company.",
            "Don\u2019t take a counter offer they will kick you out. If they felt you were that valuable they would have paid you in the first place.",
            "Ironically, what makes a great engineer is push back on the job duties bombardments. You\u2019re in a position here to tell people NO, and you stay focused on the backend work you do. You\u2019ll realize the company\u2019s value more this way and ask for job title and pay increase if you are considering additional job duties.\n\nAll depends on your age to handle the stress. 20s? Not a huge issue to take the retention offer BUT check if there\u2019s strings attached to the offer. Must stay for 4 years? Probably not, you\u2019d get pigeon holed and stagnating pay for having the audacity to try and leave.\n\nJob titles seem a mess here. Titles in start ups almost never stick so keep this in mind. A guaranteed senior title in full stack isn\u2019t shabby though.\n\nHard to compare the \u2018elsewhere\u2019 job offer. No title, no job description? We have no idea how this factors into your career planning.",
            "Is this job change about money or about stress? Because if it's the latter I don't see how more money is going to make things better. Yes, more money is always better but if you're reaching a point in which your health is affected negatively, I wouldn't even consider it. It's not worth it.\n\nIf you're young and you're all about getting that money now and build wealth for the future and you think you can handle the load given the new compensation... just keep an eye on your health. Burning out is dreadful for your career and future prospects: you won't want to work anymore, you'll end up hating and resenting everything you do no matter if it's in this company, another company, government, NGO or whatever. And messing with your health is no joke, even if you're young",
            "I've done both: the high-pay stressful job and the lower pay slower paced job. Currently in the latter, I can't put a price on having the tightness on my chest disappear entirely, I'm enjoying life a lot more and have more time to do it. I even like to work now, and I can just switch it off once I'm off the clock. And let's be honest I'm still getting good money.\n\nI would say consider the new place carefully, all the pros don't just come automatically with a lower pay, and you wouldn't want to switch to an equally stressful  position with less pay. It's hard to judge a work environment from the outside, and in most places responsibilities will grow with time, so even the first few months can still paint an incomplete picture. That said if everything checks out, I would choose to take a break and then switch. Done it before, twice.\n\nAnother point in favor of switching that might not resonate with everyone but I'll throw it out there: you already accepted a new job, and already gave notice. That's your word that you gave, twice. You gave it some thought and decided, then told the two companies. I would put that in consideration as well, both for the word that you gave others and the decision you reached for yourself",
            "If they're burning you out wait and see how much they work you after giving you that raise. Bail before you burn out. It's a very real thing that takes a lot of time to recover from. I'm three years out from the peak of my burnout and I'm just now starting to feel fresh and excited about work again.",
            "I would leave, they sound like they have no clue what they're doing. Your mental health is important. I would take your chances that the new employer has their shit together and doesn't expect you to do everything under the sun.",
            "I would honestly take it, it sounds like the stuff you are doing is definitely valuable to the company and they do not want to lose you. Whether its because others left and they are short on manpower or if you are truly excellent is hard to tell but at the very least it sounds like they value you in this company.\n\nOnly really you can decide if thats something you want to do though since you did say its affecting your mental health, to me the way ive been able to resolve any pits ive fallen in is by changing my perspective on things (i.e this would make me feel appreciate it thus making the stuff im doing feel worth while) but im not you and you definitely do not want to take a shit on your mental health for money, its not worth it in the end.",
            "More money is not going to make things better.  You have to weigh in $ and WLB/mental health.  Sure you can retire at 40 but at what cost.",
            "I know that by leaving it looks like you\u2019re also leaving money on the table, but that\u2019s not the case. Here\u2019s why. \nA retention offer almost never ends up well. You need to ask yourself why didn\u2019t the company pay your worth before. By accepting the retention offer, you\u2019ll have a target on your back. You\u2019ll be let go at the next opportunity, they\u2019ll increase expectations and you won\u2019t have anymore rises and promotions because they\u2019ll always tell you they already gave you this bump.\nMore importantly, the problems that pushed you to look for other roles are all still there. \nGet the other role and take the one month vacation, in the long run it\u2019s the best option.",
            "A friend of mine recently had the same dilemma. He chose to stay at his company for a huge pay increase and promotion to director. He is very unhappy at his job now. The amount of work has increased and the management has not improved. He was unhappy with the direction that the company was going in before and he's even less happy with it now.\n\nI think that unless there's a very compelling reason to believe that circumstances at your company will change, instead they will not. It is much more likely that you will be unhappy with a lot of money vs just unhappy. This is only really a marginal improvement. You could take that offer to your new company and maybe get a little pay bump, idk what the precise etiquette is here.",
            "You already had one foot out the door, so think about your reasons for leaving and consider whether that is going to change after 6 months to a year.\n\nIs there anything preventing them from laying you off in 3 months?  Think about that too. \n\nYou have all the power at the moment, but that all changes once you accept their counter offer so put your interests first.",

            "Is your mental health worth the pay bump?  You may have a honeymoon period where work load is slightly lower, but that will end and you\u2019ll be back to juggling 17 tasks at a time.  If you feel the new place will be a slower pace, it is probably worth it to walk away.\n\nMy current position is not paying me anything close to what I could potentially make in the Bay Area.  But I also am fully remote with a manager that respects my time.  That is worth far more than FAANG RSUs to me.",
            "It seems like you're done with working at this place. I would take the new offer and give yourself a break.\n\nIf you accept this offer, you're continue to burn out and your mental health will continue to plummet.\n\nYou're basically working 150% right now. Sure, you might earn 10% more, compared to your new offer, but I'd rather work 100% (or less) for 10% less.",
            "It sounds like you\u2019re in a tough spot, though. The raise and bonus are tempting, but if your mental health is already suffering from burnout, staying might not fix the root problem. The extra money could come with the same stressful environment. If you feel like you really need that time off to reset, the new job might be a better long-term choice, even with slightly less pay. Take the weekend to really consider what matters most for your well-being. Money\u2019s great, but so is peace of mind!",

You have a month until you start the next role, so you could even keep that position to see how your current one treats you after the raise.

In this case, since you\u2019re already there, payment up front. \n\nThis should be the total amount that is worth it to you to stay for the duration they\u2019re requesting. If they want a contract for the duration in exchange, no issues - because both parties will be fully transparent with one another. If they won\u2019t do that, then the money promised has a decent likelihood of disappearing. \n\nIf you\u2019re worried about resentment from them that you\u2019re taking advantage of the situation, that is exactly what they\u2019ve done with you up until now.

Originally I was hoping to keep my current position until I was ready for a web dev role as I self-teach and take on new projects at work, but due to some life circumstances I will have to look for a new job now.\n\nIn my current role, on top of standard IT help desk / admin duties I have had a few years of experience developing and deploying a few internally-deployed web applications, maintaining niche AV codebases, and learning web development on the side (I have been going through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) for a while now).\n\n  \nHere is how I would rate my programming skills:\n\nIntermediate level of experience (I have used these for multiple professional/personal projects and am pretty comfortable with them but not necessarily advanced):\n\n* Javascript\n* HTML\n* CSS\n* Node.js\n* Git\n* Azure\n\nSome familiarity / experience with, but maybe not enough to list on a resume:\n\n* C#\n* Python\n* Bash\n* SQL\n\n  \nWhat are some jobs that would allow me to combine my experience in IT with programming before I am ready for a full on developer role? Anything I might be qualified for now or able to work towards now?

It's definitely not a typical programming job where you're writing code all day, but many orgs are very \"pro code\" on the platform and do write a lot of code. \n\nIt's worth noting that you'd be primarily writing outdated JavaScript (at least for now), but yeah, could be a nice option.

            "In general, unless you have 10 years or more of industry experience, your resume should not be more than a single pager. I would heavily consolidate your information to be much shorter and easier to digest. Recruiters get hundreds of resumes to sift through and if yours is short and sweet it's more likely they'll actually read the information presented. I wouldn't want to read this wall of text if I were a recruiter.\n\nAnother thing that will help greatly is putting concrete numbers to your achievements/experiences. As an example, using one of your bullet points instead of saying \n\n    \"Developed prototype software to detect and count cars in a video stream\"\n\nPut a value to this, as the facts and figures stand out to the eye when skimming a resume. Say something like:\n\n    \"Developed prototype software for detection of cars which increased tabulation efficiency by 30%\"\n\n(this number is made up, just an example so you know what i mean)\n\nAnother general rule I've been told for along time was the 5x5, no more than 5 bullet points and no more than 5 words per bullet point. I usually go over 5 words per bullet point but I think you DEFINITELY need to reduce the number of things you have for each of your work experiences.\n\nEDIT #1: also remove your name and contact information from the second page IF YOU MUST HAVE A SECOND PAGE AT ALL. The recruiter already has that info from your application/online submission/first page of the resume so having it on there twice is just a waste of space.\n\nEDIT #2: also, remove irrelevant work experience. You're trying to get strictly into a software dev position, so I think the Hardware Engineer and Design Engineer work experience can be deleted from your resume altogether. If a recruiter asks about what you were doing for work at that time, you can explain in person or over email what you were doing at the time so they don't think you were bumming around doing nothing.\n\nThat's all I've got, good luck!\n\nCredibility: I am a business major with a Computer Information Systems degree and will be starting as an entry software dev at a large company later this month.

I enjoyed solving Codeforces problems and I loved learning algorithms.\n\nBut my work never involved a single \"Algorithm\" or \"Leetcode\" related task ever. I was programming in React and JavaScript and literally never understood the depths of stuff like render cycle or promises or whatever was required for my job. Whenever I had to write basic components, I knew what to do and got it done. Whenever I got to a certain bug, or some kind of an authentication issue, or build failure, I absolutely hated it. On top of that, I never understood how to bloody write tests. I never understood what's with mocks or wrappers or whatever this entire domain requires. I somehow got stuff done because I had a friend who helped me at work and always knew a way out.\n\nI interviewed for another company to take a step back and see how good I was at interviews. I nailed the leetcode rounds because I'm good at that. When it came to writing a React component, I literally had so many issues with syntax and errors which made me realize; I copy pasted react/JavaScript code for 2 years without even learning the basic syntax. I was so embarrassed because I came in to the interview with my \"years of exp\" and I fumbled so badly.\n\nTaking another step back, I realized that every project I had done in my life, was always something I wrote from scratch. I never really contributed to open source or got my feet wet with REAL codebases because I just felt like it was \"too complicated.\"\n\nThis whole thing of leetcode being used as a reference point for someone's engineering abilities may have fucked me over to think I'm good at engineering, but I'm not.\n\nI understand the overall architecture and engineering at a decent level. When I need to look at code to FIX it, I have no interest. And making that shift from one tech stack to another, learning new technologies and new languages just seems so boring. I don't even know what the fuck goes on during builds, or code splitting, or pipeline or whatever terms you toss at me. I don't want to go that deep and figure out why things are/aren't working.\n\nMy ego got in the way of my career. I thought I was good at programming. No. I'm good at algorithms and leetcode. I'm not good at software engineering.\n\nI'm thinking of making a career transition into something like technical product management or whatever. I have an exterior understanding of software. I like problem solving. Maybe I'm good at strategies? I always think of things that can go right/wrong and I'm cautious of different aspects. I noticed that specific aspect in me while gaming.

            "I have the literal opposite problem. I never studied DSA and can't leetcode to save my life, but I am an expert in troubleshooting and fixing broken code or finishing something I don't understand in the slightest. I have the same imposter syndrome you have, in an ideal world we could give each other everything we know and be twice the developer we both are. What you need are methodologies to bail you out when you are stuck. I have developed troubleshooting methodologies from years of doing everything from HVAC to building agricultural robots. Some of these may not apply to you considering you are a web dev and I am embedded / robotics but here is a list of everything I do.\n\nStart at power: May seem obvious but the first thing you check when something isn't working at all is power, do the old off / on again or even literally take a meter to the power connection to check it.\n\nTake measurements: whether they are electrical measurements or timing measurements or print statements. Find a way to test different parts of your system for bottlenecks and to make sure code is being activated.\n\nFind a comparable system: find something extremely similar to what you are trying to do and understand what it is doing.\n\nReview documentation: read all source documentation you can find related to the problem, there are many nuggets of wisdom that won't be obvious that can be hidden in the documents.\n\nGoogle the problem: lol oldie but Goldie always Google that shit.\n\nIsolate parts of system and develop tests: find way to test individual parts of the system to assure what you are trying to do is being done, they call this unit testing I believe but it is a skill that takes time to get good at.\n\nReview your assumptions: if you designed something to work and it isn't working, you very well could be making a wrong assumption somewhere. Check all your assumptions without ego.\n\nUse version control: constantly using version control allows you to test different parts of a system in a roundabout way, you can think you are fixing something, somewhat fix it, then break it again and have nothing to go back to. Version control helps you fix that.\n\nInspect visually and check all connections: for physical devices this is far more important also known as the wiggle test, I am sure there is some web dev version of this with endpoints or something idk.\n\nStay calm, do not get emotional: Never get too attached to an idea or fixing something in a certain way, it can completely blind you to the real issue and end up making you look foolish.\n\nCut things in half: cut you data, arrays, memory whatever in half, this can allow you to find many problems related to bottlenecks, overflows and other issues. It is a general rule that has served me very well when I have been stuck.\n\nGuess and check: just start changing stuff that you think may be relevant, this coupled with version control can allow you to gather the information required to isolate the problem.\n\nFind all information related to the system: software version, compliers, language version, what system it is running on etc, this lets you find the once in a while odd ball problem many other engineers don't look for.\n\nAsk for help: even if the other person doesn't help you directly, this can inspire new ideas and bring other viewpoints into the problem.\n\nKeep track of ideas surrounding the problem: write them down, keep a list in notepad++ whatever. Keep track of your thoughts on the issue and review it. I have all these things written in a notebook I keep in my bag, Every time I solve a new problem I write it down.\n\nThere are more things I have on my list but it's longer than I remember and much of it isn't applicable to you so I won't list them all here, just understand everyone has a different set of skills. Work on your weaknesses but play into your strengths, what different companies want is completely random. All these things have served me well in the past but seem foreign to many SWEs I have dealt with. You are cut out for software development, it just takes time to get good at the different aspects of it. Don't give yourself imposter syndrome over it.",

            "Definitely don't want to do something that makes you miserable, but when you get authentication issues and things like that, do you dread it because you don't understand how it should be working? I find that's the case in most people, and they just have to be shown how it works or dig in a little bit more to the fundamentals. \n\nIn terms of React, I think the FrontendMasters course on React does a great job of explaining what problems React solves for you in a way that's not overwhelming. They also have authentication courses, and Pluralsight and similar places also have things. Sometimes it's a little easier to spend a little time in that than digging in yourself, especially when you're not sure where to start. \n\nFeel free to reach out for questions or guidance if you want and I can see if I can help. \n\nSide note - I'm guessing you prorastinate some, and all it really is is your brain wanting to avoid things that cause negative emotions. Not knowing how to do something causes a negative emotion. Software Engineering is *hard* and pays well for a reason. \n\nYou have to retrain your brain to approach the problems differently where not knowing something can be a positive, or at the very least have a strategy for what you do when these situations occur. Something like a checklist. \n\n* Do I understand what's supposed to happen? \n* Is it doing the thing I expect it to? \n* Am I sure that it is because I saw it happen while debugging, or am I assuming it is because that's what I think the code is doing?\n* Have I read the documentation for examples?\n* Have I created the most basic working solution possible for this scenario in a separate small project (like a quickstart or tutorial)?\n\nThis is basic, but modify it to fit your need. If you're working on troubleshooting an issue that spans your whole system, you might add some steps. I know you probably feel overwhelming in general, but having a strategy to tackle these things takes away a bit of the unknown parts. It's overwhelming to look at a problem and say I don't even know what to do here. You start with the checklist so you're working on smaller problems rather than the whole big problem and do small pieces at a time.",

You're just 2 years into the industry. As you're already interested in LC, I feel you'll eventually like software engineering as well. Your current \"hate\" towards eng or unwillingness to learn is likely coming from the fact that you're displeased with your perf.\n\nGet a senior engineering mentor in your team or sister team that can comment on your work directly. Catch hold of him/her and get your code/designs reviewed diligently and request aggressive feedback. \n\nWhile doing this, participate in every single code/design review that you can get your hands on. It can be totally unrelated to your tech stack but take this opportunity to understand the choices. Use these sessions to understand the thought process behind a certain class, design choices, why use this over that etc.. Comment during live reviews, pull requests, design docs, oncall etc..

Remember that our goal is to learn the best, absorb the other person's expertise and eventually build something like them. Dig to the very deep until you REALLY understand the barebones.

In the process, you can sound ignorant when asking trivial questions but that's totally fine and acceptable for a rising engineer.\n\nThis approach is certainly time consuming. It might look like you're not making any progress. But trust me, with diligent progress, you'll start seeing results. Continue doing this over the first 5 years of your career and you'll reap in leaps and bounds later. Best wishes!",

Most code is edited 10-20 times more often than it is written. And all of the non-glamorous stuff you mention, bugs, authentication, concurrency, mock testing, etc. is an essential part of getting software to production. You will have to develop a knack for recognizing and fixing things like poor syntax (though IDE's and copilots help with that these days). Troubleshooting and bug fixing is its own completely separate skill and discipline. It's like cooking an omelette vs. running a restaurant.\n\nBut you are definitely far from the first person that finds that heads-down coding is not for them. If you ask around to your product and people leaders you will find that many of them started out as coders and found it wasn't for them. I talked to one business person that said they spent 2 hours staring at a block of code until they realized there was a misplaced comma and that was the last time they did any coding.

I would suggest that you ask yourself what it is you actually want to do, and figure out if there are roles that actually line up with that. You sound like you like to hack together working solutions for customers quickly, which are the core skills for consulting and sales engineer roles.\n\nSales engineering and solutions architect roles are interesting because a company selling services along side their products will need to train a set of skilled programmers to present solutions to customers who want to leverage the product solution but don't have the internal staff to actually leverage it without some support. As a sales engineer your concern is primarily the customer's level of understanding, and not the deeper level the engineers who develop the product have. Typically sales engineers are a bit of a dry-run for product documentation and tend to be the first to file bugs before the product hits customers. Often a sales engineer will be guided around how a product is intended to be used and how it can be customized, and isn't necessarily expected to have a deep understanding of a system.\n\nSales engineers are often entitled to a portion of the commission of the sale, depending on how compensation is structured. However, the current labor market isn't favoring sales-centric roles, so while this may be a good fit for your career interests there may not be an abundance of open roles at the moment outside of the AI startup world.",

        "title": "Likely changing careers; scrum has killed all enjoyment at work",
        "content": "TLDR: Old guy rants about scrum and modern software careers from the comfort of financial independence that those two things gave him.\n\nTo give context to my rant below:\n\n* 15 years in software roles; 2 as product owner roughly in the middle\n* currently (recently-promoted) chief software engineer\n* 3 companies; all companies were >500 engineers\n* at my current company, review scores are done by % buckets, and I have been in the top-10% bucket each year\n\nThree things made me realize that scrum is the primary issue for me:\n\n* Much of our office is out from Thanksgiving to New Years for vacation. I was not this year, and all the normal scrum rituals didn't happen because there were so few of us working. It was the first month I've really enjoyed at work in years.\n\n* My wife recently changed jobs to a related field (data engineer). They are not doing scrum or anything similar, and it's amazing. \n\n* Two friends in the industry that I highly respect left it over the past two years because of this and have not regretted the decision (one to finance, and one still in software but working for a state agency).\n\nThis has built up over the years. I've ended up with the view that scrum makes some fundamentally bad assumptions and it will generally drive away most better-than-average devs. When I look at coworkers that it has driven away in the past, I can't say that any were ones I wanted to leave or viewed as poor-performers. The primary negatives that I've settled on are:\n\n* **Engineers are interchangeable:** Every team I've been on has tried to operate with this principle, failed, and just pretended to while having everyone specialize (except one that stuck to it and our project was cancelled). This assumption is just absurd. We have different interests, motivators, problem types we're great at compared with others, etc. An engineer working on a valuable but not absolute highest priority thing he enjoys and has experience in will produce value way more efficiently than one just taking next available task no matter what. The repeated fear of 'but then you'll silo...what happens if someone is busy or leaves?!' has never been an issue...if one person can specialize, a replacement can be found that wants that specialty and that's always been what's happened. The cost to replace is way lower than the cost to work really inefficiently.\n\n* **Standups:** Daily standups limit hours you can work pretty severely. They are also anxiety-inducing. You have to justify your time daily, vocally, and on the spot in front of a group that's judging you. If teams had specialties and stayed together for long periods and so on, you'd build trust with teammates so it wouldn't be so bad, but that situation seems to be viewed negatively in scrum, at least where I've worked. Most team members over the years have simply lied in their dailies. I can't think of any situation where a daily standup has been more valuable than simply pinging whoever you need to talk to. A team where they are valuable seems like a dysfunctional team. Someone in this subreddit a while back made a comment that was something like 'a daily standup is a daily job interview' and it resonated. I dread it every day.\n\n* **Engineers don't own code:** This is related to the first bullet. There is a strong pressure to make it so that squads own the code and not the squad members. In my experience, this has just led to shitty code because the person writing it doesn't know much about it/has no expertise in that domain, and knows that they won't have any obligation to maintain it so just pump it out before the sprint ends and fuck you next guy that has to work with it. Since the tech lead and/or reviewers are also interchangeable and have no real expertise, they have no idea that it's shitty.\n\n* **Domain expertise is not valuable:** This is also related to the first bullet. You are not valued for understanding the domain well, and it's actively discouraged in many situations ('if domain expertise were valuable, then engineers wouldn't be interchangeable'). You're just a tool that pumps out whatever task someone gives you and you don't have the domain knowledge to make good independent decisions or question bad ones.\n\n* **The backlog knows all:** Things come up that are expensive to explain to every team member and the product owner. I and other teammates always end up having to maintain our own shadow backlogs of things that are cheaper to implement than to explain to everyone or that we just don't feel like going through all the prioritization bullshit with but need to do.\n\n\nOverall, there is zero incentive to excel in any way. Solve something really cool? No one cares...take the next item on the backlog. Want to build specific expertise? Nope...take the next item on the backlog. Spot a problem, put together a solution, save or make a bunch of money for the company? What the fuck were you doing...that wasn't the next item on the backlog.\n\nI want to work in an environment where I can solve interesting problems that someone prioritizes with me and gives me autonomy to solve. I want to grow expertise in a space and have that valued. I want to leverage that to get more efficient over time. I want some sense of ownership of what I work on. I want significant input on what things are valuable to work on. I want my colleagues to be the same...I want to work with experts who understand the problem space and not just whatever group of (interchangeable) devs got assigned to that squad that year. I want to be incentivized to solve interesting things quickly and not just get 'ok...next item on the backlog'.\n\nI've worked in software for long enough that money isn't a big concern, and my wife's job pays well anyway, so I'm very likely switching over to escape this. I haven't taken the plunge yet because I truly enjoy software development and previously loved this career, but I haven't seen any reliable way to avoid these issues. I was on one kanban team for a year, and while a bit better, it still had many of the same issues so I don't think that will fix this.\n\n**EDIT**: There's too much to respond to individually so just to provide additional info I saw in multiple questions...\n\n* **Why not just retire/what will you do instead?** I might retire...I just used to enjoy this field and I still do a lot of dev on side projects at night. I don't see myself being very happy with no job, so I was thinking of trying a different career. This is actually my second. My career trajectory was cs/physics undergrad->physics grad->physicist/research scientist for 4 years->software engineer at a hardware company->one of the largest software companies->less massive software company (current). I could go back to physics but it will be very hard after being out for 15 years. I left originally because software pays so well and research has brutal hours. The job at the hardware company was actually the best in terms of culture/process, so I could go back to that or try defense maybe now that I think about it.\n\n* **As a chief, why not just push back?** I do. At my current company, scrum is required for all software teams so I have little influence on that. My influence is more on technical direction and consulting on broad architectural changes...not so much on process. Not all companies seem bad, but a high percentage do and it's just exhausting to push back. It also hurts your career because management does not generally want you to push back in my experience.\n\n* **You're missing what scrum actually is/why it's valuable:** I'm not but I could have written a better original post. Don't read this as me saying that this isn't a profitable way to run a business. Read it as more something I don't want to participate in anymore because I have enough money and it stopped being a fun career. An analogy is maybe to think of this like an NFL player deciding he just doesn't want to get hit any longer...the NFL would lose money if people stopped getting hit, but some players will retire earlier because of the hits, and maybe they could reduce the intensity and still be nearly as profitable?\n\nAlso, a few people noted that peers judging each other is toxic or that the review/raise/promotion process being a competition among peers is off, but I'm having trouble believing that. There is (hopefully) profit each year. That gets distributed to shareholders, employees, etc. The employee bucket doesn't go out evenly. The proportions are decided by comparing them against each other in many cases. Peer input is a large component of that decision. Whether you know it or not, you are likely directly competing with your coworkers for money, influence, etc. \n\nTo the vocal advocates...you did make me reconsider one aspect strongly that I'm not sure what to do with yet. I'm biased towards thinking about how my peers and I operate and I naturally think of myself and them as high-performers. I need to consider it from the angle of 'how do you keep the worst performer from just doing nothing' in addition to my 'how do you best enable the highest performer' current viewpoint.",

The scrum master set up a Monday/Wednesday/Friday status update page and also expanded the Tuesday/Thursday stand up to 1 hour (used to be 30 min)... so the 3 headed manager doesn\u2019t care about the real purpose of stand up, they truly just want an update. I\u2019m guessing it came from the PO as she mentioned not liking to have to wait until the next stand up to know how things are going so she\u2019d probably prefer multiple updates a day.\n\nIf the 3 headed manager was removed from the stand up, I would be fine with it. It\u2019s the status reports to them that I get annoyed by. Everyday you need to make sure you accomplished something they would care about. You can\u2019t have an off day where you basically got nothing done. Our new situation might be slightly better than before as I can write my update in like 30 seconds as opposed to pretending to care about other people\u2019s updates for 30 minutes on MWF.\n\nAs for why I don\u2019t value stand ups at all is, if I need something I will reach out right away. So this is how I deal with blockers. If other people need something they reach out to me too pretty quickly. This is all the collaboration that we need. The 3 headed manager can\u2019t hear or see these things so they feel out of the loop. Do they really need to be in the loop constantly though? I don\u2019t see why they do. Every few days or once a week I could see but once a day is unnecessary. I just feel like a little kid having their mom ask if I brushed my teeth or took my vitamins... I\u2019m not a child anymore! I\u2019m a man! I\u2019m 34! I can get things done without having people checking up on things all the time.",
            "I love agile but strongly dislike scrum (or at least how most companies execute it). It's really been hijacked by business folks trying to profit off agile movement or convert it to PM 2.0\n\nThe important things are the values and principles of agile (and software craftsmanship)",
            "I'm also an old guy. 25 years in and agree with a lot of your points, but like some I attribute it more to corporate culture than any specific process frameworks. \n\nWe used to be trusted. A company hired us and trusted us to get the job done. If we didn't, we were let go. Simple. Most non-tech employees/executives respected us and had humility about the fact that they didn't know the tech as well as we did so we were given a lot of freedom. \n\nNow, everyone is an amateur expert and thinks they know best about everything. Additionally companies are in this fear-based, risk-adverse mindset so management wants everything tightly controlled. Software engineering has changed from being a creative, almost artistic pursuit to not any different than a fast food, retail or factory job (No offense to people that do those things. It's important work. It's just not how Software engineering works.) \n\nManagement likes to compare software dev to building houses or cars. It's so far off the mark. People have built houses and cars mostly the same way for a century now. Software evolves quickly and every piece of software has different requirements and different interactions needed. It's more like painting a picture or writing music. Sure, there are methods and best practices but ultimately success comes down to free-thinking and creativity.\n\nScrum or no scrum, companies want cogs that are slotted into a process - whatever that process may be. Don't get me wrong, process is good, but process has to drive creativity, not stifle it. It wasn't like that when I was coming up in the industry and some of us who are used to working that way and being successful aren't finding the same success in the new world.",
            "You're chief engineer, dont you have enough title/influences to make things happen?\n\nHell when I was a senior(not even lead)... I was so annoyed by scrum master doing bs tasks and then micromanaging. I literally spoke up in front of the team it has to stop. And it stopped. We were one of the few teams at the company without a scrum master and our team was one of the happiest high delivery.\n\nThat said I also know a scrum master who is actually valuable and awesome to have, basically help with small tasks and jira shit so engineers dont have to. And stayed way within his boundaries, just overall helpful.",
            "Stand ups: I\u2019ve seen both sides of this one. Since you covered it from the perspective of common engineering gripes (definitely things I\u2019ve thought before), I\u2019ll call out a few others from another perspective.\n\n1/ Standups help unblock people early. I can recall so many instances of people saying things like \u201coh yeah, I know that subsystem, let\u2019s chat really quickly after,\u201d or \u201coh, you\u2019re trying what? That doesn\u2019t sound quite right.. let\u2019s talk, I think I can save you some time.\u201d Now, you could say that a team chat room is better suited for this sort of stuff, but it\u2019s difficult to know whether any arbitrary arbitrary thing you\u2019re looking at on one day happens to be a thing that another team member has context with - and no one wants to be the person asking questions about literally every work item all day in team chatrooms in order to catch these potential overlaps. Standups are a forcing function for sharing small tidbits of information that help keep the collective team\u2019s mental space well lit. \n\n2/ Similar to #1, information sharing. I\u2019ve been on multiple teams to stop doing standup, and inevitably it turns into most people not knowing anything about the going-on of the business outside of their individual efforts. This became a complaint, and people discussed ways to better share information and stay plugged in to other team work at a high level. Standups plug naturally into that. \n\n3/ Having people verbalize what they\u2019re doing can help them take a step back  and view their efforts from another angle. Rubber ducking at a meta-level. I can remember multiple times when I was in mid stream with my daily update and realized I had been ratholing on a low-value distraction. \n\n4/ They shouldn\u2019t feel like interviews, that\u2019s for sure. I don\u2019t think they inherently need to. And honestly, that\u2019s kind of on everyone in the team, even lower-level ICs, to try and change. Stand ups should be a light, communal sharing ritual.\n\n\nSome people might say that 3 and 4 contradict. If you\u2019re having to explain what you\u2019re spending attention on, isn\u2019t that an undue burden? No, I don\u2019t think so. Many engineers would be perfectly happy being able to go work on anything they\u2019d like to (I know I would), but at a certain level it has to be recognized that we\u2019re professionals being paid. When one accepts that a thing that seems cool and interesting isn\u2019t necessarily a thing that makes sense for the team in a business context, it\u2019s reasonable that some mental energy should go into thinking about what does make sense, and social energy should be expended to communicate those ideas to the people you work with.\n\nWelp, that\u2019s enough words.",
            "Hey, if you don't like scrum you don't like scrum, but I do think your company has misunderstood scrum based on your dislikes.\n\n>Engineers are interchangeable\n\nWhat does this have to do with scrum? Scrum doesn't enforce code ownership? And if so it is not a vital part of if (remember that scrum is just a framework designed to be changed).\n\nScrum is designed to help teams plan work and I don't see how that makes developers interchangeable.\n\nI can see how scrum advocates for it with a backlog where you pick the highest priority item, so I can see how that might have the effect you would you're mentioning. However, it is not to make developers interchangeable, it is to prioritise what is the most important to the business.\n\n>Standups\n\nThen you're doing standups wrong.\n\nStandups should be 5 minutes where you say what you want to achieve today and if you have any blockers. That's it. Judgement is not a part of it.\n\nPeople aren't analysing your tasks to see that you're spending 2 hours more than you should. If you feel that people are judging you then you either find yourself in a toxic environment or its coming from you. \n\nIf you can't state what you plan to do for a given day without finding it nerve-wracking, then that is a problem regardless of scrum.\n\nAnother thing is that a standup should only contain a few people. It's not this big ceremony.\n\n>Domain expertise is not valuable/engineers don't own code \n\nThis I just disagree with. The important part before a sprint is that we agree on some work we believe we can finish. That doesn't mean that we have to follow the list blindly. We are able to discuss and agree that the person who knows an application best can do a specific task.\n\nAlso, I've been in situations where one developer that leaves is the only one which truly knows an application. This is can be extremely problematic, especially when the applications have been developed with the same culture.\n\nYou say that the shared code ends up being bad, but at the same time that would be your experience. If you're the only one writing code then it would always be up to your standards, and so would every other component. That means that you have a bunch of systems which has wildly different levels of quality where the individual developer thinks is great. At the same time you're struggling with knowledge sharing (ie what is good code? How do we use library x? Etc).\n\nDomain knowledge is absolutely valuable under scrum, but shared ownership helps to spread that out. While not explicitly a scrum thing, shared ownership helps to bring everyone to the same level.\n\nI'm not saying that this is you OP, but I'm going to say it because that is my general experience: I often find that developers which pushes against shared ownership, accountability and code that fits the team and not individuals not to be great developers.\n\nI often find that those developers are comfortable sitting with their systems in their little world and just truck on. 7 years later we'll see that they have built up a horrifying amount of technical debt which would have otherwise been discovered with shared ownership. When a team finally realizes that this component is so terribly maintained the one developer who knows it panicks and leaves the company (not always but has happened). \n\nAgain, I'm not saying or implying this is you OP, I'm just saying that this is what I've experienced.\n\n>The backlog knows all\n\nKeeping your own shadow backlog which defies the backlog means that you are simply not doing scrum. \n\nYou don't need to justify your estimates in great detail. You just need to estimate. The whole team doesn't need to understand the finer details of every single estimation. If something takes two weeks then it takes two weeks. Case closed. \n\n>Solve something really cool? No one cares\n\nWhat are you talking about? Scrum has demos just so you can show what you've done. It is literally baked into the process.\n\nTo summarise, either you, your team or the company has misunderstood what scrum is. I'm not a scrum fanatic and it is fine that it doesn't work for you, but it isn't this super rigid system l which you describe. It isn't this soul draining immutable process. My assumption is that your company follows a corrupted version of scrum, and I think it is important to point that out. \n\nIt is clear that some of the scrum rituals followed have become twisted and have taken on a form which is not in-line with scrum.\n\nI've worked in companies without scrum, companies with fake scrum, companies where scrum is being introduced and companies that use scrum. In every instance where people has complained about it is because they have misunderstood parts of scrum:\n - Standups takes hours and is a blame game.\n - only the easy parts are being adopted by the company.\n - stakeholders don't want to be a part of the process.\n - unable and unwillingness to maintain a backlog.\n - etc.\n\nScrum tend not to be the problem, just people using it wrong.",

Communication between team members, communication with development management, communication to stakeholders... it doesn't take a daily standup to achieve that on a good team.\n\nI'm guessing that those here that have a lot of success with  scrum  would also have a lot of success using any methodology.\n\nAnd those working at companies like the OP ( and myself these days ) will fail using any methodology.\n\nIt shouldn't take a daily standup to unblock yourself on a task.

            "i'm 17 years into my career.  The happiest moments I've had the last 10 years or so were working at some startups before the project managers were hired.   No scrum.  No standups, just building whatever was on our roadmap.  The roadmap had deliverables and dates what more did we need?  Then the place inevitably gets bigger and the gears grind to a halt as the brigade of TPMs, standups and worthless meetings arrive.  Project managers know that there was a time at every place where they did not exist or that everyone has worked at a place where there were little to no project managers.  Do I really need another person to force say 5 developers to do a standup daily when I was literally talking to those 5 guys on slack all day or in person and we all know what we were doing?  PMs know they aren't a necessity, so they come up with all these now required rituals to justify their profession / all the scrum training / scaled agile initiatives / MBAs they paid for etc because its a battle for existence and their paychecks.  They grow the PMO org until its larger and larger and injected its claws into every part of the company until this slowdown has become what everyone thinks is normal and its just this lingering pain that you have accepted.",
            "To throw my own hat in the ring here as mod, I have seen scrum implemented successfully and even then we finally switched off of it to a better system (Shape Up) that actually worked. The thing with scrum, is that even if you're doing it right, you're doing it wrong. No other industry asks people to deliver 100% for years on end (not even NASA, why do you think they have so many processes to check if things have gone wrong? Because people *can't* deliver at 100% for years on end), and that's exactly what scrum is set up to do. So right off the bat you've got a failing system, even if you're implementing scrum exactly as everyone agrees it should be implemented (hilariously retros were what got us to switch to Shape Up). \n\nScrum will never succeed even if implemented correctly because the fundamental premise is wrong.",

When it works it is because it falls on a team where the plurality naturally work with it well.\n\nScrum does seem best suited to web development to me, where all parts of the stack are accessible and understandable. But if you build an operating system or a satellite software stack that goes out the window.\n\nYou all are probably right that scrum doesn\u2019t say engineers are cogs, but something about it makes people feel that way. That needs more examination.\n\nI work in a place where some old engineers have spent up to 4 decades looking at what works. They have done waterfall, they have done scrum. And we try to take the bits that work and invent things to fill the gaps. We can\u2019t buy a book to describe it but it works.\n\nOP, go somewhere where it will feel like fun.

But most \"agile\" and \"scrum\" has been highjacked by corporations to do the exact opposite of the founding members intent. \n\n99% of corporate scrum is waterfall with more meetings.\n\n\nAnother complaint I have about scrum is if you finish a task quicker than expected, you're just assigned another task. If your team ends up finishing a little earlier than expected, you're rewarded by being assigned a bigger workload the next sprint. \n\nBut if you take longer than estimated, suddenly everybody is concerned. \"Why is this taking to long? Are you over engineer it? Sounds like you didn't do a good enough job gathering requirements? Why did you spend so long in the unit tests?

            "Look man, what you're seeing isn't agile or scrums fault.  Not really; because agile / scrum does not exist in the real world.  It does not survive first contact with ~~the enemy~~ management.  Management, from the top down has an incentive to 'increase shareholder value'.  How do they do that?  Well, they don't really *understand* software development, so there's this constant push for 'continuous improvement'.  Management's job is to try and squeeze every ounce of productivity they can from their devs.  This drive has existed as long as there have been companies.  It existed when waterfall was the dominant model.  It will continue when agile / scrum is replaced by whatever new hotness gets sold by management consultants.\n\nThe key here, is not to ask for autonomy, it's to *take it*.  Figure out what business wants at a high level, and figure out how to get them closer to that goal.  Management needs to be able to trust you, and your direct reports.  How do you establish trust?  You deliver results without having to be micro managed.\n\nThere will always be ceremony around doing your job.  Figure out how to rig / play the game.  Get good at clearly communicating what you're doing, and what results you are delivering.\n\nFinally, most importantly, work, save, and invest until you're financially independent.  Then, start pushing back against bad management.  Learn when to say 'No'.  Sometimes this will lead to conflict.  Hell, sometimes that conflict will result in you no longer working there.  Does it matter?  Nope, you're FI.  All that matters is that you're competent and deliver results.  Do that, and you have a cadre of people willing to vouch for you, and work as long as you want it.  Being FI changes the game brother.",
            "Rather than quit the industry, you could find work with a small employer, where you are a sole developer or lead of a small team. You can then reduce the Scrum ceremonies based on your views. However, I don't think you should do that at all. I think you should fix it.\n\nI wanted to add an observation to the other advice you've received, which is that you are a Chief Engineer. I assume that means you are a Team/Technical Lead as well, or if not, at least these statements will be true:\n\n* Your views will be easily heard in your team because your experience is important/valued\n* Part of your role will (explicitly/implicitly) be mentoring less experienced engineers\n* You can/should take an interest in helping other engineers succeed in their career\n\nWith that in mind, it feels odd that someone in your role should be pushing back against Scrum itself so wholeheartedly. I suspect it is within your seniority to confidently fix what isn't working, and from what you've said, there is plenty that isn't working. If there are people in your current org who are lying in the stand-up, then fix that, keeping in mind the no-blame rules. If someone is too nervous to speak, then have a one-to-one with them, and try to find out the root cause. Build the  confidence of your team, both for the benefit of the org and the individuals concerned. If there is a judgemental atmosphere in meetings then either you've misread that, or the team needs to take actions to trust each other. Pick this stuff up in your retros.\n\nFinally, I do not advocate using your wife's or your friend's experiences of Scrum to prove to yourself that Scrum doesn't work. I wonder if here you are seeking data points to show that there is a backlash against Scrum and/or that corporates are increasingly using it to exploit developers.

Are you sure this isn't a problem with the company culture rather than scrum?\n\nMy entire career has been at two companies: one that excelled at scrum and one that absolutely failed at scrum. \n\nThe team that did scrum really well? That was a dream job. This company treated its engineers as an asset. Looking back I realized that we had autonomy over the code, mastery of the domain and purpose in our work. Managers played a supporting role. The culture espoused an 'engineering-first' mindset and that was reflected in the teamwork, the team's overall drive and our attitude towards finding solutions. This was all reflected in the quality of our code. \n\nThe team that implemented scrum poorly? Dreadful. This company treated its engineers as a liability (a cost-centre in business-speak). Managers were the primary decision makers.\n\nRestricting work to the next ticket on the backlog. Status meetings after status meetings. Backlog refinement sessions. Long drawn out retrospectives with few actionable takeaways. 'Interchangeable engineers' became so disengaged. After a while it became so draining that I started blaming the process. How could I not? I found all of this faffing about to be so frustrating and counter-productive. In hindsight, it was the culture and management to blame. They're the ones to push forward these ideas and call it 'scrum'. Having worked within a real scrum team, I knew better.\n\nOP's words (and many other commenters here) really resonate with me due to my experience with that awful team. I am so grateful to have had my first experience in scrum with leaders who knew what they were doing. Without that context I'd most likely blame a process sooner than the people managing it.",

A task will take as long as it's going to take. My job is not to provide estimates, my job is to fix things.\n\nThe only thing a sprint is good for is telling other people and teams that you can't do something because \"it's not in the Sprint.\" Frankly, if that's the biggest benefit of doing sprints for a team, it sounds like someone needs to grow a pair and learn to say no.\n\nThere are so many people in management positions that oversubscribe to the agile philosophy that they wind up at the opposite end of the spectrum.\n\nAlso the whole agile ecosystem has totally been sold out. The idea that someone can be a certified scrum master seriously blows my mind and I don't really understand why that's even a thing. You're just a project manager at that point.

Project manager doesn\u2019t even do anything with them or listen to anything brought up during them. He doesn\u2019t ask us to scope any issues - just assigns them points and a vague AC and then that\u2019s how long its supposed to take.

Sometimes I don't show up to the stand up. I suggested meetings should be optional at a retro. Also suggested someone is kicked out at the beginning of every meeting as a gift to then to not have to be there.\nAt least over video I'm sitting down. The worst part off the stand-up is when you have to stand up. I used to refuse to stand and sit down out of protest to standing. If everyone else is standing I can use a second chair to put my feet up so at least that's good.\n\nWhen people keep defending these bad practices saying that when people complain about it that means they're doing it wrong that is so dumb. If so many people are doing it wrong them the name has become meaningless or more frequently associated with something bad than whatever ideal not bad scrum they are talking about.

            "When I read these posts from people hating scrum, I usually find the problem is elsewhere. Scrum is not something that makes dysfunctional teams or companies work better, neither something that destroys productivity and enjoyment. It is just a set of recommendations, it is up to you how you apply them. Communication and people is what makes them work well or fail. I have been in a situation where two teams used the same methodology, had the same PO and one worked very well, the other was complete disaster. Scrum was seen as the problem, but that was shut down by comparison with the other team.\n\nTo your points:\n\nI do not think engineers being interchangeable is a something forced by scrum. And I agree that they are not. In scrum, you get a set of tasks that should be finished in a sprint. The team decides who will work on what. So it is natural that tasks related to one component will be done by the person who knows it best. However, there should be an overlap - at least one other member of the team should have some knowledge of the component so he can step in if needed. These people should review each other's code, so people with domain knowledge are doing the review and the can keep some level of code quality. If only one person can work on certain things, it is indeed a problem, but jumping to the opposite extreme of everybody being the same is equally bad.\n\n> An engineer working on a valuable but not absolute highest priority thing he enjoys and has experience in will produce value way more efficiently than one just taking next available task no matter what.\n\nThat is true, but in the end, the company pays you for your time and if the company needs something done, it's your job to do it.\n\nI do not understand you problem with standups. I did not have a problem as a programmer and now that I manage a team, I see them as very important if the team has more than 2 people. I do not see how does 15 minute meeting severely limit the hours you can work. Who is judging you on standups? Do people berate you after you say what you worked on or something? That seems more like hostile work environment than anything scrum-related. If your standups take hours and feel like a job interview, they are not standups, but something else.",
            "I have a feeling that SCRUM nowadays resembles some sort of a religious ritual, where you don't immediately see any benefit that it brings, but rather **have to believe** in its ability to be beneficial in the long term.  Expressing any doubts that SCRUM may not be beneficial is the fastest way to mark one as a toxic person these days.",
            "Several experienced devs have been complaining about this for a while. I think in my last few years at my old job I dodged a bullet.\n\nWe did pretend agile... in a way. We had standups three times a week and a team meeting on Friday which was 95% the manager relaying status about the organization... and almost exactly what I did for the several years prior when I was a manager. (I went back to IC.)\n\nRetrospectives and using the past to calibrate the future was key! With two-week sprints missing deadlines due to natural underestimation (and most people are honest, really!) wasn't penalized; we just adjusted and reasonably load balanced.\n\nContrast this with my early days. We had 2-3+ year ship cycles where the delivery mechanism was a CD and marketing had events planned months in advance. When crunch time came IT SUCKED. Think 24/7 with people sleeping in their offices. \n\nSo, CI/CD really does have benefits to be grateful for -- in the right organization.\n\nTo be critical, it's weird to see great and experienced developers with high levels of what appears to be learned helplessness.

They'd work four hours a week at best. I'm not talking about one or two people -- there were teams of people this applied to.\n\nOne was the risk forecasting model infrastructure group. Ultimately the director of the department built a whole new team that used the cloud stack because, while the old infrastructure could conceptually support what was needed, the team refused to implement forecasting workflows required to satisfy regulatory compliance.\n\nAs developers, we're craftsmen and women.

It helps prioritise and structure.  \nThe key ingredient, though, is good honest communication. And that is not really \"scrum\" as such.

It's a random walk that tries to maximize your current state without perfect knowledge of alternate states, and has an accumulator lets call it experience which stores past states.\n\n> Simple stochastic games (SGs), e.g. [17], are zero-sum games played on a graph by players Maximizer\nand Minimizer, who choose actions in their respective vertices (also called states). Each action is associated with a probability distribution determining the next state to move to. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.09465\n\nOne example is we can choose a Bound Value Iteration algorithm. Here specialization would appear in the bounded values over multiple iterations. We can imagine choosing a terrible specialization would 'pidgeonhold' your job search algorithm by reducing the upper bound initially very quickly. This works both ways as it would also reduce a recruiters upper bound as well if that is strategy they are using to evaluate candidates. \n\nThe thing that changing states repeatedly would do is it would normalize outcomes.

        "title": "Drunk Post: Things I've learned as a Sr Engineer",
        "content": "I'm drunk and I'll probably regret this, but here's a drunken rank of things I've learned as an engineer for the past 10 years.\n\n* The best way I've advanced my career is by changing companies.\n* Technology stacks don't really matter because there are like 15 basic patterns of software engineering in my field that apply.  I work in data so it's not going to be the same as webdev or embedded. But all fields have about 10-20 core principles and the tech stack is just trying to make those things easier, so don't fret overit.\n* There's a reason why people recommend job hunting. If I'm unsatisfied at a job, it's probably time to move on.\n* I've made some good, lifelong friends at companies I've worked with. I don't need to make that a requirement of every place I work. I've been perfectly happy working at places where I didn't form friendships with my coworkers and I've been unhappy at places where I made some great friends.\n* I've learned to be honest with my manager. Not too honest, but honest enough where I can be authentic at work. What's the worse that can happen? He fire me? I'll just pick up a new job in 2 weeks.\n* If I'm awaken at 2am from being on-call for more than once per quarter, then something is seriously wrong and I will either fix it or quit.\n* pour another glass\n* Qualities of a good manager share a lot of qualities of a good engineer.\n* When I first started, I was enamored with technology and programming and computer science.  I'm over it.\n* Good code is code that can be understood by a junior engineer.  Great code can be understood by a first year CS freshman.  The best code is no code at all.\n* The most underrated skill to learn as an engineer is how to document.  Fuck, someone please teach me how to write good documentation.  Seriously, if there's any recommendations, I'd seriously pay for a course (like probably a lot of money, maybe 1k for a course if it guaranteed that I could write good docs.)\n* Related to above, writing good proposals for changes is a great skill.\n* Almost every holy war out there (vim vs emacs, mac vs linux, whatever) doesn't matter... except one.  See below.\n* The older I get, the more I appreciate dynamic languages. Fuck, I said it. Fight me.\n* If I ever find myself thinking I'm the smartest person in the room, it's time to leave.\n* I don't know why full stack webdevs are paid so poorly. No really, they should be paid like half a mil a year just base salary. Fuck they have to understand both front end AND back end AND how different browsers work AND networking AND databases AND caching AND differences between web and mobile AND omg what the fuck there's another framework out there that companies want to use?  Seriously, why are webdevs paid so little.\n* We should hire more interns, they're awesome. Those energetic little fucks with their ideas.  Even better when they can question or criticize something. I love interns.\n* *sip*\n* Don't meet your heroes. I paid 5k to take a course by one of my heroes.  He's a brilliant man, but at the end of it I realized that he's making it up as he goes along like the rest of us.\n* Tech stack matters. OK I just said tech stack doesn't matter, but hear me out. If you hear Python dev vs C++ dev, you think very different things, right? That's because certain tools are really good at certain jobs.  If you're not sure what you want to do, just do Java. It's a shitty programming language that's good at almost everything.\n* The greatest programming language ever is lisp.  I should learn lisp.\n* For beginners, the most lucrative programming language to learn is SQL. Fuck all other languages. If you know SQL and nothing else, you can make bank.  Payroll specialtist?  Maybe 50k.  Payroll specialist who knows SQL?  90k.  Average joe with organizational skills at big corp?  $40k.  Average joe with organization skills AND sql?  Call yourself a PM and earn $150k.\n* Tests are important but TDD is a damn cult.\n* Cushy government jobs are not what they are cracked up to be, at least for early to mid-career engineers.  Sure, $120k + bennies + pension sound great, but you'll be selling your soul to work on esoteric proprietary technology. Much respect to government workers but seriously there's a reason why the median age for engineers at those places is 50+.  Advice does not apply to government contractors.\n* Third party recruiters are leeches.  However, if you find a good one, seriously develop a good relationship with them. They can help bootstrap your career.  How do you know if you have a good one? If they've been a third party recruiter for more than 3 years, they're probably bad.  The good ones typically become recruiters are large companies.\n* Options are worthless or can make you a millionaire.  They're probably worthless unless the headcount of engineering is more than 100.  Then *maybe* they are worth something within this decade.\n* Work from home is the tits. But lack of whiteboarding sucks.\n* I've never worked at FAANG so I don't know what I'm missing.  But I've hired (and not hired) engineers from FAANGs and they don't know what they're doing either.\n* My self worth is not a function of or correlated with my total compensation.  Capitalism is a poor way to determine self-worth.\n* Managers have less power than you think.  Way less power.  If you ever thing, why doesn't Manager XYZ fire somebody, it's because they can't.\n* Titles mostly don't matter.  Principal Distinguished Staff Lead Engineer from Whatever Company, whatever.  What did you do and what did you accomplish. That's all people care about.\n* Speaking of titles: early in your career, title changes up are nice.  Junior to Mid. Mid to Senior. Senior to Lead.  Later in your career, title changes *down* are nice.  That way, you can get the same compensation but then get an increase when you're promoted.  In other words, early in your career (<10 years), title changes UP are good because it lets you grow your skills and responsibilities.  Later, title changes down are nice because it lets you grow your salary.\n* Max out our 401ks.\n* Be kind to everyone.  Not because it'll help your career (it will), but because being kind is rewarding by itself.\n* If I didn't learn something from the junior engineer or intern this past month, I wasn't paying attention.\n* Oops I'm out of wine.\n* Paying for classes, books, conferences is worth it.  I've done a few conferences, a few 1.5k courses, many books, and a subscription.  Worth it. This way, I can better pretend what I'm doing.\n* Seriously, why aren't webdevs paid more? They know everything!!!\n* Carpal tunnel and back problems are no joke.  Spend the 1k now on good equipment.\n* The smartest man I've every worked for was a Math PhD. I've learned so much from that guy. I hope he's doing well.\n* Once, in high school, there was thing girl who was a great friend of mine. I mean we talked and hung out and shared a lot of personal stuff over a few years.  Then there was a rumor that I liked her or that we were going out or whatever.  She didn't take that too well so she started to ignore me.  That didn't feel too good.  I guess this would be the modern equivalent to \"ghosting\".  I don't wish her any ill will though, and I hope she's doing great. I'm sorry I didn't handle that better.\n* I had a girlfriend in 8th grade that I didn't want to break up with even though I didn't like her anymore so I just started to ignore her. That was so fucked up. I'm sorry, Lena.\n* You know what the best part of being a software engineer is?  You can meet and talk to people who think like you.  Not necessarily the same interests like sports and TV shows and stuff.  But they think about problems the same way you think of them.  That's pretty cool.\n* There's not enough women in technology.  What a fucked up industry.  That needs to change.  I've been trying to be more encouraging and helpful to the women engineers in our org, but I don't know what else to do.\n* Same with black engineers.  What the hell?\n* I've never really started hating a language or technology until I started becoming intimately familiar with it.  Also, I think a piece of tech is good if I hate it but I simultaneously would recommend it to a client.  Fuck Jenkins but man I don't think I would be commuting software malpractice by recommending it to a new client.\n* That being said, git is awful and I have choice but to use it. Also, GUI git tools can go to hell, give me the command line any day.  There's like 7 command lines to memorize, everything else can be googled.\n* Since I work in data, I'm going to give a data-specific lessons learned.  Fuck pandas.\n* My job is easier because I have semi-technical analysts on my team. Semi-technical because they know programming but not software engineering.  This is a blessing because if something doesn't make sense to them, it means that it was probably badly designed.  I love the analysts on the team; they've helped me grow so much more than the most brilliant engineers.\n* Dark mode is great until you're forced to use light mode (webpage or an unsupported app). That's why I use light mode.\n* I know enough about security to know that I don't know shit about security.\n* Crap I'm out of wine.\n* Being a good engineer means knowing best practices.  Being a senior engineer means knowing when to break best practices.\n* If people are trying to assign blame to a bug or outage, it's time to move on.\n* A lot of progressive companies, especially startups, talk about bringing your \"authentic self\".  Well what if your authentic self is all about watching porn? Yeah, it's healthy to keep a barrier between your work and personal life.\n* I love drinking with my co-workers during happy hour.  I'd rather spend time with kids, family, or friends.\n* The best demonstration of great leadership is when my leader took the fall for a mistake that was 100% my fault.  You better believe I would've walked over fire for her.\n* On the same token, the best leaders I've been privileged to work under did their best to both advocate for my opinions and also explain to me other opinions 'that conflict with mine.  I'm working hard to be like them.\n* Fuck side projects.  If you love doing them, great! Even if I had the time to do side-projects, I'm too damn busy writing drunken posts on reddit\n* Algorithms and data strictures are important--to a point.  I don't see pharmacist interviews test trivia about organic chemistry.  There's something fucked with our industry's interview process.\n* Damn, those devops guys and gals are f'ing smart.  At least those mofos get paid though.\n* It's not important to do what I like.  It's more important to do what I don't hate.\n* The closer I am to the product, the closer I am to driving revnue, the more I feel valued regardless of how technical my work is.  This has been true for even the most progressive companies.\n* Linux is important even when I was working in all Windows.  Why?  Because I eventually worked in Linux.  So happy for those weekend where I screwed around installing Arch.\n* I've learned to be wary for ambiguous buzz words like big data.  WTF is \"big\" data?  I've dealt with 10k rows streaming every 10 minutes in Spark and Kafka and dealt with 1B rows batched up hourly in Python and MySQL.  Those labels can go fuck themselves.\n* Not all great jobs are in Silicon Valley. But a lot are.\n\nFinally, if you really want to hurt me, don't downvote I don't care about that. Just ignore this post. Nothing makes me sadder than when I wrote a long post and then nobody responds.  So if you hate this post, just ignore.",
        "comments": [
            "Oh shit I found beer: let's keeping going.\n\nOn programming languages:\n\n* I once hated a programming language (C#) until I started using it.  Now I hated it but think it's useful.\n* Then I started hating a programming language (C#) and left it and came back.  Wow, that programming language has really improved.\n* The greatest thing about functional languages is that functions are first class and all other programmers know that.\n* No matter how great or superior a language is, it doesn't matter if people don't use it.\n* Learning a language isn't hard.  It's learning the ecosystem.\n\nOn coworkers\n\n* Pair programming is great, it just takes a lot of time--time that the company usually doesn't want to spend.\n* Working with smart engineers has made me a better coder.  Working with smart non-technical co-workers has made me a better engineer.\n* Don't spend time outside of the 9-5 working.  Unless you want to because you got a banging project and you're in the groove.  That shit is awesome.\n* Happy hours and social hours across teams are 99% just chilling and getting to know coworkers.  That's cool.  Every once in a while, the 1% is about a critical project with a critical piece of code and you're glad you brought up work in a social setting because shit would've hit the fan otherwise. I'm not saying that I should hang out with other teams outside of work because of this.  I just want to bond.  But it sure as hell is a nice perk.\n\nOn working from home\n\n* If the company is half remote and half on-site, it's important to determine if the remote people aren't treated as second-class citizens.  If major decisions are made \"at the water cooler\", then it's better to try to change the company culture (hard) or move on to a different company that treats its remote employees as first class citizens.\n* The second worst major downside of working from home is no whiteboard.\n* The first major downside of working from home is that it's hard to learn from coworkers.  Unless I'm (a) confident and assertive to ask questions and (b) the company has a culture where remote workers are equivelent to on-site workers, I think it was best that I worked on-side for the first 5 years of my career.\n\n\nOn technology\n\n* Everyone knows that tech changes.  The tech landscape of the past 10 years has changed dramatically.  But fundamentals don't change very much, especially fundamentals that apply to my field.\n* Hacker news and /r/programming is only good to get general ideas and keep up-to-date.  The comments are almost worthless.\n* There's a lot of vocal amateurs with strong opinions about technology. Even amateurs published on \"respectable\" journals and blogs. I found it to keep abreast of the rumors but to figure things out for myself.\n* I work at a cutting edge startup and we don't use the latest XYZ tech that was present at ABC cutting edge tech company.  And it turn out, what they usually present is only a small percentage of their engineering department and that most of them are using the same tech we are.\n* That being said, it's important to read the signs. If you want to work with modern tech and you're company is still doing the majority of it's development in jQuery, might be time to re-evauluate.\n\nOn Data Engineering\n\n* Fuck it I'm a data engineer so I might as well give more specific, target advice/experience\n* SQL is king.  Databases like MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, SQL Server, SQLite is still supreme.  Even if you work with new tech, most of it transfers anyway.\n* Most companies aren't doing streaming.  It's hard and complicated.  If you're 10 years into your career and you don't know how to work with 10k records per second, don't worry about it, there's still jobs out for you.\n* Airflow is shit, yes.  There are other products out there, but fuck me if Airflow isn't the most widely used.\n* Machine learning projects are highly prone to failure.  They're complicated and hard to implement.  Don't believe me?  How easy is it to write fucking unit test a machine learning model?  Yeah.\n* Our field is new.  There's no good book on data engineering, just go and \"do it\".  Can't learn it through a bootcamp and shit.  This will probably change in 10 years as we all figure out what the fuck we're doing.\n\nOn Life\n\n* People die.  Do you want your code to be your legacy?  If yes, then spend a lot of time on it because that's your fucking legacy and you go!  But if you are like me, your legacy is surrounded with family, friends, and people in your life and not the code you write.  So don't get too hung up on it.\n* Good people write shitty code.  Smart people write shitty code.  Good coders and good engineers write shitty code.  Don't let code quality be a dependent variable on your self worth.\n* I got into tech and coding because tech was my hobby.  Now my hobby is is the same as work and work has ruined my hobby.  So now if I want to enjoy tech I need to quit my hobby.  Or I need to be OK that tech is no longer my hobby and find new hobbies.\n* Programming and computer science is like, what, 80 years old?  Compare that with any other engineering discipline.  Yeah, we collectively don't know what the fuck we're doing.\n* I'm making pretty good money.  Be grateful and appreciate.  Also, save.\n\nOther shit\n\n* I've built large platforms and libraries that are used by multiple teams and people for many years. Yet for some reason, the most proud I was of the code I wrote was the small script that was used by me.\n* The proudest accomplishment of my career has been helping other people be better at their jobs.  That's probably because I'm destined to be a people manager, so this is probably not helpful to other people.\n* When I was looking for a job, I created an updated my Linkedin. I got shit replies and deleted it.  Now I use Linkedin to find other candidates to join my company.  Bottom line, Linkedin is a lot of noise.  I only find it valuable because now, part of my job is contributing to that noise.\n* Once, I found out in college that a girl liked me. I didn't believe it because I had poor self esteem, but then she asked me out.  I told her I wasn't interested even though she was really cool. That was one of the proudest moments in my life because I as mature enough at 19 to say \"no\" in a mature way.\n* /r/cscareerquestions is such a cesspool of ego and misinformation that I don't know what to do about it.  Like, WTF.  I want to shake all those people and try to explain to them how the world really is, but they wouldn't believe me.\n\nOn my general feelings right now\n\n* I'm drunk and I usually don't drink, so I would think that everything I say is probably cringy or terrible\n* I feel strongly that people should save and invest money. If you have a 6 figure salary, do your best to max our your 401k please.\n* I've become what I've always hated: someone who works in tech in a career but avoid tech in real life.  Maybe that comes with being old.\n* /r/ExperiencedDevs is a pretty cool community.  Thank you mods.  You get way less appreciation than you deserve.  Seriously, thank you.\n* I probably owe my career, my salary, my life to Reddit.  Reddit gets a lot of shit but the communities here have lifted me out of poverty (working at a gas station earning min wage) to learning Linux, SQL, python, C#, Python, and others to get me where I am.\n* Kids are great.  I don't have kids by choice.  Why?  Because I love kids and I'm scared about what kind of father I would be.  Oh shit, is that too personal for a post here?\n* Once, someone asked me who I looked up to and I said Conan O'brien, and they laughed at me.  But I was being serous because on [his last show on the Tonight Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcF1OoWqXBc), he told his audience to be kind and work hard.  It happend during a difficult period of my life, and when I watched him say that, I said, you know what, I'm going to do just that.  Because what would I have to lose?  And you know what?  I've met some brilliant people who I've learned from over 10+ years because I was kind to them.  And I've grown a lot by working hard and not being afraid to try new things.  And my life is infinitely, infinitely better because of those words.  So yes, it might seem silly and even ridiculous to say that I've achieved a level of fulfillment in my life because of a late night talk show.  But you know what, fuck it, it's my life and I will proudly say that I owe any success I've achieved because a fucking comic on late night television.\n\nI'm highly intoxicated so please disregard anything I say.  Also apologies for ranting.",
            "Oh man I love the responses.  You all are friggin awesome.  On the whiteboards: yeah it's not the whiteboard per se.  It's the collaboration on a whiteboard.  If it's just about drawing something out, then pen and paper is fine.  It's the collaboration between two people on a shared workspace where you can easily draw out ideas.  It's the \"here's my idea but here's the pen what's your idea and shred mine to pieces\" workspace.  A shared text editor isn't the same.

The difference is in *what* you\u2019re documenting with your comments. I like to comment things like why I did something a certain way, not for OTHERS but for ME when I come back to the code in a month or a year, so I can remember what I was thinking and why things needed to be done a particular way.

Which is wrong, the comment or the code? A typical scenario is that the code got updated, in response to change, but no one changed the comment. So guess the code is correct. But, they ask, that aside, why are two seemingly unrelated countries given special handling? If it's because they still haven't switched to center-negative enturbulator connections in their phone switches, then the comment should say that.  Just having a comment hanging there with no explanation is almost pointless - you can see from the code that there is a special case, and the comment gave you no information. It's basically an \"increment the counter\" comment, except that it serves some purpose by calling your attention to there being a special case in the codebase.",

            "As a junior dev who had a fantastic mentor and came from an aerospace engineering background here's my advice on documentation:\n\n* Start it at the beginning. I mean like even before you write your first line you should have a basic flow diagram of how you expect things to look.\n* What's that you say? You aren't starting a new project? Yours is 10 years old and there's almost no documentation? Well when's the second best time to plant a tree? Today. Start writing your own documentation and show it off during your merges. Go around and ask the other devs to share their documentation with you. Everybody writes stuff down whether it be for designing or to help them remember, sometimes it just takes someone willing to put it all together.\n* Make updating your docs part of your merge process. Yeah you don't need or want to add every change to it, but at least have them read through the relevant portions to make sure they didn't miss anything.\n* Just write shit down. Formatting documentation is great for delivery but how many times have you looked at the index of your documentation instead of just doing a Ctrl + f? If you learn something interesting about the code. Write that shit DOWN. Take a minute to see if a relevant section exists, If it doesn't then just make a new section and write it down. You or another dev will thank you later.\n* Flow diagrams and block diagrams > words. I have yet to find a paragraph that explained something more clearly than a picture in software. Yes they often go hand-in-hand and more often than not they should. But if you have to choose which one to start with, choose your block diagrams and flow diagrams. Use block diagrams to capture complex objects, if I have a class that has multiple layers of child classes beneath it, I make a giant block and a bunch of smaller blocks within it, then add a brief description of each class, and use arrows to show important dataflows. I haven't found a way to show inheritance clearly though. Block diagrams are also great for visualizing dataflow through a system, and for simple objects that have a unique purpose (as is often found in \"clever\" or opaque code)\n* Use color. When you're making your diagrams take a few extra minutes to color your blocks. It makes it look less scary, more readable and honestly who doesn't love playing around with a digital paint palette?\n* Write your documentation for your devs, not your customers. You guys are the ones using it so write it so it makes sense for you.\n* Make it easily accessible and searchable. I've been doing everything on confluence. Yeah the version tracking is virtually non-existent, but if the documentation is just designed to show the current state of the code then who cares? If you want to do version tracking, then export it and track it with your repo I guess? I still haven't found a good way to do that with formatted docs.\n* Lead from the front. Everyone should be doing documentation and that starts with your lead or architect or whoever everyone on the dev team looks to for guidance. If they see that the lead is documenting then they will too.\n* Don't make it mundane. If you aren't delivering the docs then there's no reason it has to be professional. A friend of mine who was a sailboat captain told the crew he was training that they could write anything they wanted in the log as long as they still logged the important stuff. I tell my team a similar thing. You can write whatever you like in it as long as it captures what the code is doing.\n\nI hope that helps. If anyone wants to talk more about it or critique or add to this please do. I just started as a lead on a team of 4 including myself. We were given a side project and I just kinda ran with it. So I'm just taking what I've seen work in the past and trying to use all that to guide my team now.",

            "Thanks for sharing, that is a helpful perspective to learn from. I\u2019ll try to repay the favour by passing along some documentation tips. I haven\u2019t found a good course on it either, but I do work in support and improve our client-facing doc whenever I have time, often based on user feedback. Sorry if any of these sound too obvious or aren\u2019t applicable for your specific audience, but hopefully they will help someone.\n\nThink Cotton-Eye Joe for the topic being documented:\n\n- where did it come from (input-wise)\n\n- where did it go (output-wise)\n\nA lot of the questions we get are related to the above eg what field in the database was involved, what conditions triggered a calculation/omission. Keeping the requirements and expected behaviour up-front is key, as well as any limitations.\n\nI often get the answers from fumbling through the code (I\u2019m the \u201cgreat code\u201d target market), but in an ideal situation, I\u2019d pair with devs and have them talk me through each portion of the code in plain wording. So if you can imagine scrolling through what you\u2019re documenting and saying aloud to someone less technical, \u201cThis is where we do _______ with _________ because of _________ so that ________,\u201d then that\u2019s a good start.\n\nRemember that someone without your foundational knowledge or experience with your organization may be wandering across your doc years later after you go, so you can\u2019t assume that context that is obvious to you will be so to the future user.\n\nBreaking things down into smaller sections is a great way to build from scratch as well as being more readable. Bullet points, even/especially nesting ones, are also one\u2019s friends when documenting. Long paragraphs will cause folks to skim past more.\n\nProviding examples for things needing the user to input a string, one with the structure and one with an actual instance of input, is great, too. In terms of other examples, I try to consider the scenarios that clients are most likely to use and incorporate that.\n\nOutside of the \u201cfeed X in to get Y\u201d type circumstances,  \u201cdid you know\u201d factors may be nice to include, eg the file name structure of what will be output.\n\nIf something is getting too cumbersome to explain, it may help to reframe, say by setting up a table or diagram.\n\nScreenshot-wise, I often need to see the relevant parts of the program involved, or else the documentation feels somewhat meaningless and unmoored. I shouldn\u2019t need to ask myself, \u201cWhere\u2019s that button I\u2019m supposed to press?\u201d It should be described fully *and* shown to me. There\u2019s an art to good screenshots:\n\n- hide unnecessary components, eg the ribbon if it\u2019s not part of what needs to be shown\n\n- provide a big enough screenshot to show context so that it\u2019s clear what part of the program is being used, or use text to explain the source\n\n- manually resize things as needed to cut down on useless white space that might stretch out the screenshot\n\n- fill in options as needed to share as much relevant information with the user as possible. For example, if the doc is about selecting settings, filling that whole dialog box out such that conditional menus will appear or settings you\u2019ll talk about later are present is best.\n\n- focus on features of note when screenshotting, eg by strategically positioning the mouse over a specific button so it stands out, highlighting/selecting a certain line of code, getting a tooltip to appear, or simply annotating after the fact like by drawing a rectangle around the feature\n\nIf something like a dev tool is what\u2019s being documented, a description of a specific feature\u2019s options might be more relevant than a screenshot, though. I have to consult our third-party tool dev documentation sometimes, and it\u2019s not always clear to me what a certain option means until I try it.\n\nSo basically, anticipate any follow-up questions when you write, break things down into smaller components, add relevant examples and descriptions (more than you might think you need), pick different methods of presentation if one isn\u2019t working, and include illuminating screenshots.",

Javascript is python with a worse standard library and a faster runtime. Their data models are the same. Fite me.  Solid python/JS programmers are as common as java ones, and solid python/JS takes 1/3 as long to write and 1/10th as long to pivot.

            "> The most underrated skill to learn as an engineer is how to document. Fuck, someone please teach me how to write good documentation. Seriously, if there's any recommendations, I'd seriously pay for a course (like probably a lot of money, maybe 1k for a course if it guaranteed that I could write good docs.)\n\nI disagree. Documentation is overrated. If you know how to read code very well, then you'll never need documentation ever again.\n\n> I don't know why full stack webdevs are paid so poorly. No really, they should be paid like half a mil a year just base salary. Fuck they have to understand both front end AND back end AND how different browsers work AND networking AND databases AND caching AND differences between web and mobile AND omg what the fuck there's another framework out there that companies want to use? Seriously, why are webdevs paid so little.\n\n\"front end\" and \"back end\" are arbitrary distictions anyways. Programming is programming. I'm a full stack developer myself, and I don't think what I do is any special than what any other developer does.\n\n> Tests are important but TDD is a damn cult.\n\nThe TDD cult peaked in 2010, when I was first starting my career. These days it's not a prevalent as it was before. I agree that TDD is overkill. There is nothing more annoying than TDD fundamentalists.\n\n> Managers have less power than you think.\n\nPower comes from personal relationships. If your manager is an old high school friend of your CEO, then your manager has ALL the power. If your manager is golfing buddies with the CEO, then he has all the power. If your manager was hired off Indeed.com just like you were, then he has no more power than you have.\n\n> If I ever find myself thinking I'm the smartest person in the room, it's time to leave.\n\nThe problem with this is that the smarter you get, the dumber the rest world gets by comparison. The smarter you get, the harder it becomes to find another person smarter than you. I've resigned to the fact that I'll never have another co-worker that is smarter than me, and I'm OK with that.\n\n> I know enough about security to know that I don't know shit about security.\n\nThis pisses me off. I don't believe security is a distinctive skill separate from programming itself. If you're good enough of a programmer to understand what a SQL-injection attack is, and you know how to mitigate it, then you're good enough to call yourself a security expert. All security vulnerabilities are in the form of sending invalidated arbitrary input into some form of an `exec` function. The problem is that the security industry has done a very good job of convincing the masses that computer security is a massively complicated topic that only mega geniuses that spend 8 hours a day reading whitepapers can begin to understand. It's sad to see that so many people fall for this propaganda.",

It's a shitty programming language that's good at almost everything.\n\nYup\n\n>  I should learn lisp.\n\nIf you know Java, checkout Clojure. It'll hurt your brain at first, but worth it IMO. There's also a dialect (ClojureScript) that compiles to Javascript, so theoretically it's the only language you should ever need to build a full lisp stack. It's sad it's not more popular, but that's Lisp in a nutshell: it should be taking over the world and did everything first, but somehow parens were too scary\n\n> I don't know why full stack webdevs are paid so poorly.\n\nThey are if they call themselves \"webdevs\" It's dumb but I'm basically a webdev but with the title \"Software Engineer\" rather than \"Front-end Engineer\" I get paid like 50% more. Sure, I do a helluva lot more than just frontend, but most devs are some sort of front/back/devops hybrid anyway.\n\n> Cushy government jobs are not what they are cracked up to be\n\nHell yeah. Worked for a military contractor and it was crap. Paid way below average, mediocre benefits, and all kinds of Office Space nonsense like reply-all emails fighting over food in the fridge ugh.\n\n> I've never worked at FAANG so I don't know what I'm missing. But I've hired (and not hired) engineers from FAANGs and they don't know what they're doing either\n\nYou're right. The main benefit is getting to use frameworks that the company provides that lets us not reinvent the wheel. Shoulders of giants, learning from history, and whatnot. On the other hand, it's frustrating as hell to see the exact same mistakes be made over and over. \n\n> if something doesn't make sense to them, it means that it was probably badly designed. \n\nwhat a nugget of wisdom\n\n> There's something fucked with our industry's interview process.\n\nabsolutely, it's so hard to change now b/c everyone's just mimicking everyone else\n\n>  So happy for those weekend where I screwed around installing Arch.\n\nhaha same! distro-hopping in college really paid off somehow\n\n> Those labels can go fuck themselves.\n\nSo many labels like \"big\" \"micro\" \"super\" are just non-words at this point.

Of course you always have more skills, but many jobs on the market don\u2019t need that level of expertise these days. I know that\u2019s not entirely true but that\u2019s how some of my colleagues feel.",

            "i dont really see any serious initiative on the part of companies to try and make developer well being the number one priority. i was burned out and quit my last job and im in a coding retreat currently where a lot of people feel pretty burned out too. i think most people ive spoken to here are feeling that way. it saddens me to think that this might not be a sustainable career. It also saddens me to see that a lot of this is due to how everything is structured, where we ultimately dont really have any say in our working conditions. The only advice i ever see when someone is at a toxic workplace is \"you need to quit and find a new job\", but thats completely short sighted. We cant all job hop and expect the industry to change. I think dev's need to take more ownership of the culture at the places they work at, and really push for consistent improvements. Im not sure of any other way out of this cycle, yet im not seeing dev's take this on seriously as their daily responsibility",
            "5 YoE dev here and I'm feeling the burnout pretty bad.",
            "I think there are multiple factors:\n\n* For the decade before interest rates spiked, the economy slowed, and layoffs started to hit in 2022-ish, developers were in ridiculously high demand, and it was a great feeling. You could be fairly confident that you would be listened to and given opportunities to level up. When that changed, we all had to come to grips with more conservative expectations. In some cases, you have to work hard just to keep what you have, rather than get ahead. That can be a hard pill to swallow.\n* Company culture is getting a lot more somber overall. Focus tends to me more on cost savings than on moonshots or new growth. People are more cynical.\n* In some companies, there is a flattening where there are fewer managers and bigger teams. You can feel a lot less like you have a voice in that context. Likewise, it can burn out managers (that's what happened to me).\n\nI think we had it really good as a career for quite a long time (since like 2010 really, riding the mobile app wave and all the resulting service companies). Now, we're slowing down. Tech will pick up steam again, once we find our next rocket ship. Maybe it's already gestating. Or maybe what we had was just unsustainable and we're getting closer to a realistic career.",

I parlayed that into several high paying consulting opportunities. Currently finding a niche in AI. This industry requires constant reinvention. \n\nI have lamented several times that a doctor only has to learn the human body once and they're a doctor for life. Programmers have to relearn their craft every 5-10 years. \n\nWe have no unions or governing body like doctors, lawyers, dentists, vets, etc.  and that makes the barrier to entry very low and there is no rate protection.

            "I don\u2019t mean for this to sound awful or \u201czoomers are the issue\u201d but here we go:\n\nI think there is a lot of title inflation at lower levels. I personally work with 3 engineers with 4.5 - 6 years of experience who are all \u201csenior\u201d. They all were promoted to said level at 2.5 years of experience. The issue is that none of them operate at a senior level, which means it is all on me to handle any issue that comes up. I cannot depend on them to complete tickets on their own, or own on call (I am contacted if anything remotely challenging comes up). \n\nOver the past few years, all responsibility has been transferred to people at my level (Senior II/Staff I). It is tiring to work on a team with people who can\u2019t own their own tickets or minor features. They can\u2019t be depended on to do something on their own. Every issue needs to involve me (or someone at my level). \n\nI also work with some young people who are phenomenal and really rise to the level, but we set such a low bar for people that some realize that it is better to not put effort in that to do so and get a 3% bonus and the same raise as everyone else. This isn\u2019t a generational thing but rather an issue with managers growing their empire and refusing to hold standards. I also think that part of this empire building has taught younger engineers to play the bureaucracy game. I am amazed how often a 27 year old engineer will bring up points, involving an engineering design, like \u201cwe aren\u2019t using the new standard company font here\u201d or \u201ccan you make sure to link this doc in another doc\u201d. I rarely get engineering feedback, just formatting feedback. I don\u2019t work with dumb people, they are actually very smart, so smart that they optimized their learning for what gets them ahead.

            "I've been in the industry for 26 years now, and I've gone through lots of ups and downs. Feeling good and then being burned out later, and then I find a new spark or challenge to get me interested in doing things again. I think burn out exists in EVERY occupation and is a result of the human condition more than the industry. But you can also contribute some of the burnout to the huge push to get more people into technology over the last couple decades, and people ran out and did a couple bootcamps, applied to jobs that others were better qualified for, and then realized they aren't in bootcamp anymore, and things aren't as clean room laboratory as their class. Now they are facing the real challenges and because they don't have the knowledge to systematically approach a problem and break it down into steps and pieces, they get overwhelmed and that is a surefire way to get burned out. I get burned out when I get bored because I'm not challenged anymore, I do it because I love the satisfaction of solving problems that others can't. I have a lot of the qualities that make a good programmer. Attention to detail, perfectionism, curiosity, great trouble shooting skills, being able to view the whole project in my mind at once and see how the pieces fit. Some of those aren't learned, they are innate to your personality and approach to life.",
            "It is the same with every industry everywhere at the moment. Trying not to sound overly-dramatic but I've been saying the last few years since COVID, we are in the capitalism endgame unless something drastically changes. \n\nAll most public companies have given up any semblance of chasing anything else other than the all-mighty share price. This was fine when it started in the 80s and 90s where companies genuinely did have inefficiencies and emerging technologies (computers and automation) could make a significant change to a company's ability to grow and profit. \n\nBut finally, through the 2020s we've gotten to the point where companies have become (more) efficient, costs are going up (because of those pesky humans they employ) and so profits are already close to maximized. But Wall Street demands more, so we start cutting corners. Let's bring in this new CEO (or listen to our board) who says they can work wonders and bring us into a new age. More profit!\n \nAs CEO, I start increasing prices and reducing product manufacturing footprint (candy/chocolate bars getting smaller, etc.) where I can. Maybe I can actually genuinely effectively eliminate some real inefficient practices. Great! That elevates profits for a quarter or a year, but it doesn't stay exciting for long. \n\nOk, let's start eliminating 'fluff' positions. Now, enough of the old guard is still employed by the company at this point that the decision is made to not eliminate positions outright, but to outsource instead. Outsourcing on paper looks brilliant (and often can be) - the outsourcing is cheaper than hiring outright. I don't need to manage these people (I can reduce HR), and I can get rid of all of these pesky old timers with their opinions and pensions. \n\nNow the company looks great (on paper)! I've saved and eliminated a ton of internal bullshit waste (on paper) and my business is now in the record profit territory (on paper). Now, I've started to get some rumors from under the troll bridge that client complaints are up and quality appears to be slipping. Offshore development has brought with it some inefficiencies I didn't account for and I've noticed that over time, our ability to QA/QC and manage the offshore teams has slipped as frankly, we don't have enough technical staff left to understand and manage anymore (that expensive lead dev layer was the first to go - opinionated fucks). But you know what? I don't care; I won Wall Street, mic drop, I as CEO bow out a rich legend and move on to do the same thing elsewhere. Nobody ever measures me against my long term effects - yay!\n\nAnd that is IF your company wasn't bought by a competitor or invested in by venture capatilists - if it was, picture the above with a lot more rollercoaster rides of bullshit stock options, golden handcuffs, etc. while you are shuttled around, your buddies 'retired' and any semblance of a 'core' team dismantled. And those golden handcuffs that keep you locked in? They sure as shit ain't putting those same restrictions on that CEO.\n\nAnd I think this is the state we are currently at - where tech companies are so desperate to make the almighty wall street sing, we are entering new business models that previously would have been considered unprofitable or pointless and while they chase some form of profitability, the \"employees\" are the worst expense, never the valued ones - I could call out the entire gig economy here... Hmmm, how can I upset an industry to extract profit from it while paying people as little as is humanly possible knowing that the folks who have been in that industry for years will end up getting 'reset' to the new baseline I've caused when I'm through? Hold my pint...\n\nFor those wondering, I'm not against the rise of the gig-economy, it's good to see established, potentially unhealthy industries get realigned - I mean who wasn't happy initially to see taxi competition with Uber and the like? The issue is, by he time the US likes to regulate anything, the damage is already done and the new pattern for the industry has been established - always towards the interests of the companies, not the employees in that industry. \n\nFor anyone reading this, this is extremely tongue-in-cheek as I sit here nursing a cup of tea. I'm  seeing a lot of things that I just don't like about the way we humans allow ourselves to conduct business. While this is a gross oversimplification and ignores so many other factors, but there's just not enough morals and conviction to providing quality service and/or product in the American system. I.e. you can profit and still value your employees and customers. You just might not grow as fast as the market demands - why has that become a barometer of 'failure' for the US economy?

So in order to navigate those dangerous waters you have to hope that your management chain is mostly of folks smart enough to remove the bad choices and not give the shortcuts as options to those making the decisions.  \n\nSales people are promoted into leadership roles and decision making roles much more often than we are because they make money for the company in a way that we can\u2019t demonstrate directly the same way. \n\nSales people are all about delivering exactly what was agreed upon as quickly as possible to collect money and bonuses. Sales people don\u2019t care about how hard doing it fast and dirty will affect the next deliverable because the soliton wasn\u2019t architected in a future proof way.  Sales people will never prioritize the technical debt necessary to go back and update that work.  \n\nThis makes it so we also have to be politicians and manage up. We have to lie . We have to withhold information and we have to build in our own skunk-work projects as part of expanded and exaggerated timelines in order to keep the ship from going into disrepair. \n\nThis to me is what burns me out.  \n\nI want to work for people that care about quality and want to make good product.

Happy and rested engineers are productive ones.\u00a0 Devs get on average 4-6h of real work done per day,\u00a0 regardless of how long they're actually at the office.\u00a0 Your big job is ensuring they achieve maximum productivity in that time.\u00a0\n\n\nThat goes for you too. You have to work EXTRA hard to guard your time and set a good example.\u00a0 The beast is hungry and will ALWAYS want more from you and your team. Team level leadership is in aa unique place of being the only ones who both know the situation on the ground AND the strategic situation for the company. You're really the only one who can control the flow of work.\u00a0\n\n\nSo if there's more work to do than you can get done in 40h...you have to be brave enough to leave it undone and communicate what's happening to leadership.\u00a0 DON'T just put in extra time or demand extra hours from your team to try and hide the problem.\u00a0 It just doesn't pay off over time.\n\n\n\nYou're in the middle when it comes to communication.\u00a0 You keep the team informed about the state of the company, and the company informed about the state of the team. How good you are at communication is one of the biggest impacts on the perception of your, and your teams success.\u00a0\n\n\nShield your team. Protect them from meetings, blame, demands, and shifting. Give them as much transparency as you can.\u00a0\n\n\nDelegate aggressively.\u00a0 You're responsible for making sure things get done,\u00a0 but not necessarily for DOING them. You don't have to run every meeting,\u00a0 prepare every report,\u00a0 or head every initiative. And the more you spread the work the more your team members will grow and learn to self manage.\n\n\n\nThough when it comes to technical work, try and delegate responsibilities, not tasks. You want team members to pull in tasks rather that wait to be directed. You want your teams to self organize and self manage as much as possible.\u00a0\n\n\nStart with trust, don't require team members to earn it. Assume they're competent, hard working, and dedicated and then deal with it if they violate that trust. The whole thing only works if you can trust people anyways. So start there and then get rid of them if they can't be trusted.\u00a0\n\n\nUnderstand that everyone works and thinks different and embrace that.\n\n\n\nFinally, and this might be a bit controversial, but it's worked really well for me and the team leads I've mentored.\u00a0 I like to encourage unmasking and transparency on my teams.\u00a0 I tell them I know we all have off days and even weeks where we get distracted by YouTube, or some hobby, or our brains just WILL NOT get traction on a task.\u00a0 Lots of devs have multiple slow days and make up for it with big productivity pushes on their good days.\u00a0\n\n\nThat's all ok...as long as they will be transparent.\u00a0 A team lead can manage around that. Pairing, swarming,\u00a0 and body doubling is all very effective.\u00a0 Tasks can be reassigned, or deadlines renegotiated. But we can only do that if everyone feels comfortable being honest.\u00a0\n\n\nThat's what stand up is really for, in my mind .\u00a0 Not reporting progress,\u00a0 just planning how to move forward every day.\u00a0 Team members checking with each other to see if there are any issues they can help each other with, and making a plan for the day.\u00a0 I highly encourage teams to stop doing round robin style and instead just walk through the current tasks.\u00a0\n\n\nI'll cut it off there, as obviously I'm getting a bit wordy. :)\u00a0 Hope there's something of value there for you.",

One take I found interesting is that burnout might persist or recur, but you can make it becomes less of a problem if you don't treat it as such. Having a DGAF attitude about surpassing goals at work becomes important here at tempering expectations so you don't over exert yourself.\n\nOn the other hand, that attitude can also lead to complacency and caring less about what the career can do for you. Or simply you take your career for granted, and left to pick up the pieces rapidly, in the case that you are laid off. Shouldn't that attitude be equally bad for all developers? \n\nA lot of developers just do their job, do the minimum of following orders and stop thinking of work as they go home, and they kept that momentum for many, many years.

Even though in both cases, their career was handled with the same mostly passive attitude.\n\nSo if this DGAF attitude isn't what makes or breaks a career, what does? Common conclusions might be, they're no longer keeping up with market demands and learning new skills to stay employed and that's why they can't find work. Or that they did not network well enough to be a known quantity in their circles. But I still kind of disagree in the sense that these two things still falls under the \"DGAF\" umbrella.\n\nMaybe I have to actually dissect what that mindset means and what are considered the \"okay\" parts and what are the destructive parts of the mindset.

And I don't care that much about the business, either, except as it pertains to my retirement hobby: writing fantastic code that gets the job efficiently and correctly.

I'm not going to dwell on it and complain about how life sucks.   I don't tie my self worth to  the code I write at work as I get paid to do what the company wants at the end of the day.\n\nIf management wants everybody to use tabs and not spaces in code then it is what it is. I'm not going to throw an tantrum over it saying how they are wrong as IDGAF.\n\nIf you give me unreasonable arbitrary deadlines and I tell you as such, but you insist people try to meet it without any flexibility then IDGAF.  I'm not going to work 60-hours per week to meet it. I'll put in my fair effort \"8-hours\" and call it a day.  Whatever gets done gets done and I'm not scared of failure. If  management asks why it's late I have no problems telling them the reasons why. \n\nIf somebody comments on my code in a code review to change something \"nit-picky\", then I'll probably do it if it's inconsequential to code quality.

I don't think productivity is only tied to how much code you can churn out.

For me there are very few that I will die on because it's just work.  It's not about slacking off and doing as little as possible which is the tone I get from you post.\n\nAs another poster said, the point is not to give a fuck about failure, criticism, what your peers think about you, and so forth.

He didn\u2019t want any promotions. But he was able to complete anything we asked him for. His code was pretty stable and mostly worked. He was really good at CSS animations. But didn\u2019t know a ton about anything else. He still works there 6 years later successfully. \n\nThe intern also DGAF. She did \u201cwhat we asked for\u201d. But the issue was she did it exceptionally poorly. Everything took her 5-10 times as long as it should. She kept merging code that didn\u2019t work. When I asked about it she said \u201cI did what the ticket said it\u2019s not my fault all the tests are failing.\u201d Right before she got fired she took me to coffee to ask how to get offered a full time position. I told her to go back in time 3 months and actually meet the minimum standard for the job which was not making a huge mess I had to constantly clean up. I told her that what she thought was \u201cgood enough\u201d was about 30% good enough and she had no shot at getting the job. \n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nOne other thing that can cause this is not every team is large enough to support good enough.

By just being good devs they are less likely to be fired and easier to get another job if you are fired.\n\nAlso \"clocking out\" from work doesn't necessarily mean you are not improving yourself, it just means you are not picking fights with stakeholders and devs (so more interpersonal stuff) and not pushing to fix bad code (which can net you some experience, but mostly just nets you counter-examples of what not to do).\n\nIt is quite common for people that are \"clocking out\" from their day job to just start programming in their free time instead.",

But at the same time, I understand and appreciate that trying 3x harder doesn\u2019t net you a single extra penny (but plenty of bonus effects of burnout) while your bosses reap the benefits. I think if everyone tried at like 90%, then nobody would have to be doing an extra 4 hours every day though, and burnout would likely lessen\u2026 for as long as management would take to say \u201cwhy don\u2019t we push a little harder because we can?\u201d But again, a united front wins all politics wars.

It's important to not get too attached to a company or a codebase. To realize what you are working on is just a job and it's something sometimes else owns and makes money off of. But, like a good watchmaker, you can still care, give good advice, and take pride in your craftsmanship. \n\nFinally, SO much of this job is managing expectations and communication. No one can truly see how hard you work. Oh, they may be able to see how long you sit at a desk or how many commits you do. But that's not the same thing. So it's not REALLY putting in time that makes people think your working hard. It's how you communicate what you're doing, how you estimate and deliver, etc.",

It's great advice for people that just cannot control their spending.\n\nIt's pretty bad advice for people that never carry debt.\n\nThere was one post here recently, where a person was complaining about being worked too hard and a lot of people said \"you gotta stop caring so much and find somewhere else to work\".\n\nBut then others did the math and got clarification on how much the person was actually working, and it was like a normal work week early in their career.

And when that is at risk, you are asked to leave. They don't care about you.

I understand that if I want to go far and make a lot of money doing this, then I need to keep up with the times and learn new skills to boost my career.\n\nAt the same time, I realize that there's no need to go too far above and beyond at a job than I deem necessary. I'm a salaried IC, and I know that I'm getting paid only a fraction of the revenue I generate for my employer. If I put in more and generate even more revenue, the odds are more likely that I'll get paid the same regardless. Even if my efforts this year generated 10% more revenue than they did last year, my merit raise will probably not scale with that.\n\nMy policy is to put in the extra effort when I'm confident it's going to proportionally benefit me. If work wanted me to take on a project that's using a technology that I've had zero exposure to but I know it's hot on the job market, I'll probably feel more inclined to burn a little midnight oil because I know the knowledge and hands-on experience will benefit me in the long term. If work wanted me to do an AWS course on my own time, I'd do it because that knowledge and certification would benefit me in the long term.\n\nI will not tolerate an employer expecting me to sacrifice my free time, and by extension my physical and mental health, for their benefit. \"Keeping my job\" is not something I personally consider something that benefits me.

You need to build that reputation, that branding for leverage as well. When you do good work, known for that good work, you can rely on that reputation to help you bounce back.\n\nThe problem I see with many people is the notion of fear. Fear of losing their job. Fear of not producing which puts them into paralysis. Fear of trying to get another job.\n\nYou can still DGAF and not be complacent. To me DGAF, the concept is you know your worth. You know your back-up/contigency plan. You know you can walk away and it is no skin off your back. You can recover. And example for me is I have about 3 years of savings which I instilled in myself due to a layoff 10 years ago. I told myself, I would not panic if it happened again so I built up a rainy day fund. This may explain the cavalierness/DGAF attitude.  I am not worried about getting laid off due to the contingency plans, the relationships that I have fostered over the years.\n\nWhen you reach that state, you can do lot of push back in your day-to-day. You can just take PTO and say, I am not working in this. This enlightenment allows you to work less and strive for better work-life-balance because you have leverage. What is the employer going to do? Nothing because they have no leverage besides letting you go.\n\nBut as you ended your post, the \"attitude needs a degree of planning and calculation.\"",

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\n**TL:DR: Based on the 5 experiences below, should I change teams, companies, careers, or stay put. Sorry for the long post. (if I should take it down, just let me know)**\n\nSo, I was really hoping to get some advice here. I've been a developer for quite some time, and it has been something of a rollercoaster ride for me. There may be some underlying issues that I've been ignoring, but I was hoping that maybe you guys could help me identify those. My career thus far has been both good and bad, but even in school, it was the same.\n\nThe goal of this post isn't to bash my previous teams, but I truly wonder if anyone has had this much fluctuation in their career path as an engineer. Sometimes, I wonder if this is actually a common occurrence in software development careers, or if this is just a team/company issue. More so now than ever, I've considered switching careers, because it truly seems like it will be a constant.\n\nI've presented 5 distinct experiences so far just so you'd have context. \n\nI would really appreciate anyone's advice, feedback, or guidance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**College:**\n\nSo, in college, I was a Mathematics major. I grew up loving math, and I loved all that you could do with it. However, I learned very quickly that once we got to the proof-based courses (all the others were fine), it was as it I just couldn't think in the same language as my professors. I didn't do very well, but I managed to get by. I also picked up a minor in Computer Science, which was fun with the exception of the OS-level courses. I simply loved how creative I could be with it. So, I pursued a career in software engineering.\n\n**First Job:**\n\nMy first job as a software engineer was both good and bad. I got creative projects and I got to make changes that people around the world could see. I was 100% the \"UI-guy\" at this point, because our previous UI specialist had left the company. I had a role, and it was great. I could be creative at work, and help millions of people. Eventually, we had a re-org, and this put me on a new team, where UI work was not at all something they cared about. More often than not, I found myself in situations where I was asked \"why don't you know this?\" or \"why do you keep looking up how to do things instead of memorizing them?\" This was usually in reference to OS-based things. I tried my best to be useful in every other way I could be, including going through our customers feedback and identifying how we could make our product more useful. I was then presented with the statement, \"sometimes, even if we know we can do something to improve the customer's experience, we simply don't because it means they will pay for our service longer waiting for it.\" I'm not sure why, but this statement bothered me so much, so I left for a new job.\n\n **Second Job:**\n\nMy second job was as a SRE/DevOps Engineer. It seemed like a great opportunity since I could essentially help both the company and the people with it. I could be creative and build tools that hopefully, would benefit everyone. However, while I got to program/code to some degree, most of my job was watching dashboards and rerouting phone calls. Eventually, some of the team took to watching movies or playing video games all shift (and in some cases, bring in their drones) whenever the manager wasn't there due to the sheer amount of down time they had. I quickly watched my team grow in frustration with the way the team was managed, and over my time there, 75% of my team had either left or had been fired (largely due to growing disgruntlement with the way things were). My manager frequently skipped my 1 on 1's with him and eventually, it came to a point where I'd only see him at bi-monthly intervals. I become something of a heads down programmer on the team, building random project and random project, hoping that eventually, someone would pick something up. Finally, I realized no one would, because I was the only one who could code and was willing to. I don't know if my code was good or bad. I just knew everyone was disinterested. So, I tried to move back to a software development team.\n\n**Third Job:**\n\nMy third job was something of a relief for me. I got to develop for a customer facing set of services, and I truly don't think I've ever been so happy for an extended period of time working in my life. There were always things to learn, always ideas to be discussed. and always opportunity for improvement. I think 90% of what I learned as a developer today, was through that team. I did everything I could for the team, and ultimately got a promotion for it. That said, it didn't matter that I got a promotion, because I simply loved the job. Additionally, it was through this job I realized the importance of negotiation of your salary. Mine had been so far off the mark that my team/manager grew concerned for me and fixed it (this was a huge fix). For the first time ever, I felt like I was in a place where I cared about the work, and my team cared about my input. I even led a few projects here and there as well. I truly envisioned staying with the company forever, and potentially becoming an engineering manager at some point because of it. The sheer amount of support I received was phenomenal. However, when COVID-19 hit, of course this shook things up a bit, leading to another re-org.\n\n**Fourth Job:**\n\nFor the first time, even though this was my second re-org, I often wondered why I was placed were I was. I often asked why at this point. Before my official start on my new team, I learned that I would be joining a failing, politically-corrupt team; that the current members of the team refused to teach, learn, or share any new information, because with doing so, it meant their jobs would be in jeopardy of being taken by younger developers. This was a team the entire company needed, but seemed to hate working with. I don't think I truly understood this at the time. That said, I learned why I was put on the team. I learned that I was put on the team solely because I was a DevOps Engineer in the past (work that I grew to hate by this point). The entire goal was to get people together to transform this team, despite expecting some of the other engineers there to push bad. Our tech stack was incredibly old, and the previous team members where clearly specialists. No one was willing to learn anything new. Only the newer members tried. This team was so under water, that asking anyone for help seemed like a huge burden on them. That said, what we heard, was in fact the case. The team eventually was split down the middle as ops and automation. Eventually, the team functioned as separate parts. It eventually became all about systems design and pushing for ideas that we could never get an unanimous decision on (almost always 50/50). Eventually, I had stopped coding entirely, and a bulk of my job had become manual labor (yes, turning devices on and off). I have been a \"software engineer\" for several months on this team, but I've never felt so distant from it. So, as you'd expect, I decided to leave to a more development centric team.\n\n**Today:**\n\nI am posting this because I genuinely want some advice on how to proceed.",

So at that point I was freelancing for both the agency and on my own. I continued freelancing an additional 2 years.\n\nPast the 5 year mark in my career at that point. I wanted to go to working a full-time job, because technically I *never* worked full-time in my life, even as of today.\n\n- 4th job I got an offer from a SaaS startup, as a contractor not full-time (sad face), but at least I was paid 40 hours a week. 2 years in, startup founder was saying how their sales quarters are getting worse and worse. Read the writing on the wall and quit. \n\nI went back to the freelance gig stuff, which really is just me doing part time work with client seeking in between. The 2 years starting with COVID I could not get any clients. \n\nAt this point I have 9 yoe if you ignore all the down time I spent not working.\n\nDespite all these crazy twists and turns I don't feel like I'm on par with other developers with 9 yoe. I never received promotions or pay raises. I never even mentored junior workers or had a role in interviewing people.\n\n Most of my tech skills growth I think was in my first 3 years and still using those same things, only doing them slightly faster. When I go on job interviews I fall short on many things. I don't know much about DevOps. I don't work with cloud technology. My mind draws a blank on testing and SDLC because my dev positions have been largely isolated. I do not know what makes me \"job worthy\" anymore.\n\nSo I asked myself, how is this possible, and is it a regular occurrence for a developer to start part time or freelance but still having a tough time demonstrating like they are doing more, that their sphere of influence has grown.\n\nI'm not looking for a senior level position. I'm currently looking for any legit full-time job that can help give me an idea where I fall in best and work my way up from there.",

Prior to each promotion they were given more responsibility and exposure to new things that helped them grow professionally. \n\n\n> still using those same things, only doing them slightly faster\n\nBased on this description, I would level you as a mid-level developer. In your 1:1 with your manager you need to make it clear that you want growth opportunities. Ask them for help in approaching a senior developer/tech lead on your team to get exposure to higher-level tasks like assisting in designing something. If work like that isn't on your team's plate soon, then instead start assigning challenging work to juniors on the team that want growth and you assist them and help them learn and grow.",

        "title": "The tech industry currently favors specialized engineers over generalists.",
        "content": "From the perspective of a mid/senior engineer who has spent the last 4-5 years as a full-stack generalist, I'm realizing that the tech industry currently favors specialists. And why wouldn't it? Why would someone hire a top-tier React dev when their company is looking for a Java dev and there are dozens of top-tier Java devs in the interview loop? I think this is happening because of the layoffs, and I don't know how soon it will recover. Perhaps specializing will be very important until 2025 or even 2026.\n\nHere's my hot take: A lot of generalist engineers always come to these threads and say that being a generalist is great. But a lot of these generalists succeeded in the biggest tech bull market. So I feel like these takes have \"survivorship bias\". Kinda like hearing \"I made a successful career as a generalist and I've seen lots of successful generalist engineers so you should do the same\". Maybe this advice worked from the 2010s - the 2020s, but it just isn't useful anymore. Specializing in a specific field (be it frontend, backend, mobile, systems, ai/ml, data engineering, ar/vr, etc.) is very important for getting those interviews.\n\nSpecialization is also happening with FAANG companies now. This didn't exist before because there were more generic interview loops.  All you had to do was LeetCode. But now, that's changed. Google does a team match before the final round. So you only get an interview after a hiring manager already screened your resume. And if the HM is looking for SRE, but you have React.js experience, you probably won't get a callback. Facebook also has specific interview loops based on the role (frontend, backend, mobile, SRE, ar/vr, systems) you are applying for.\n\nI wish it weren't the case but this is just what I've observed. Thank you for coming to my ted talk. Would love to hear thoughts about this from other experienced engineers. Is the tech market shifting, or am I just way off base here?\n\nEDIT:\n\nFound a comment that describes what I mean by specializing.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/12sipub/comment/jgzi6u3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n\nI've copied the full comment here:\n\n\"I think it's naive to think that experience in a certain ecosystem doesn't matter. It's not about languages, but a lot of people (mostly on Reddit) try to pretend it is. \n\n[Note: When I said \"top-tier React dev\", I was referring to someone who understands the entire frontend JS ecosystem including TypeScript, State Management, Rest/GraphQL APIs, NodeJS, NPM, etc. I did not mean someone who only knows React. IMO, you can't be a \"top-tier React dev\" if you don't know the technologies/frameworks/tooling related to it.]\n\nI'm a \"Java developer\" but there are actually 3 components:\n\n- The language: not relevant. What I know about Java you can probably pick up 90% in a few weeks. Heck; I work mostly in Kotlin nowadays.\n\n- The tooling, libraries and frameworks: massively relevant. 15 years of working with Spring for instance isn't something you make up in a year.\n\n- The type of software I build: massively relevant. There is a huge difference between the type of things a back-end dev builds compared to front-end and embedded. And even within back-end the type of work I do is generally different from what a wordpress developer does.\n\nI'm sure it's a tough pill to swallow for a lot of people, but there is a reason so many companies want applications to be a close match to what they currently need. The larger the distance the higher the risk that you won't be productive before you eventually leave.\n\nThere is an experience bias in Reddit where a lot of people have mostly experience with junior roles. No one is going to want a new grad to have stack specific experience because it's not relevant. But for a very senior IC who's expected to explain to others how things work, them not having that actual experience means they won't be able to fill that role for an extensive amount of time.\"",

I expect in 5 years there will be another disruptive technology, and some things that people cling onto (react, spring, pyspark) will be outmoded. I can always tell by how over-zealous the users are.

And why wouldn't it? Why would someone hire a top-tier React dev when their company is looking for a Java dev and there are dozens of top-tier Java devs in the interview loop?\n\nFrom the perspective of a senior engineer with 29 years experience in the industry in both the UK and the US and have also interviewed many potential candidates over the years, from my experience the industry has always been like this and has always preferred making an offer to a developer that has the *closest match* of skills needed for an open role if there are multiple candidates available.\n\nOnly in cases where there hasn't been a best match have alternatives been considered, where e.g. someone has experience with framework x but not the required framework y but were offered the role because it's likely they can pick up y on the job. From a business point of view, why wouldn't you prefer to take a closer or exact experience match than someone who doesn't have the exact experience required? It's the lower risk option and potentially lower cost if the candidate hits the ground running with less time to ramp up.\n\nWhat I can say from experience over the past 30 years is that it did used to be more common that a company would take on a new entry level developer and offer to train on the job. In the last 10 years, maybe longer, there's been a definite shift to requiring x years of previous experience.\n\nYour experience will vary though, the recruiting preferences and strategies differ wildly from company to company depending on many criteria - small team vs large team, new team vs established/experienced team, startup vs established company etc.",
            "I think that's too broad of a generalization. I've been a full-stack engineer for 25 years in the US, and I've always been valuable. I'm not a \"generalist\" per se - I work very hard to have depth in a particular stack, at any given time. That's harder today than ever obviously, but certainly not impossible.\n\nIt's fair to say that certain roles favor specialization and others favor someone with a broader range of experience. As I've moved up in seniority and leadership, the broader the skill-set, the better. If you want to be a architect/lead/director where you're calling the shots but still in the code, generalization is a better place to be.\n\nI can't picture \\*not\\* being a full-stack dev. I don't encourage younger devs to specialize...partly because they may not their strengths yet and also, it's good for younger devs to realize the entire world before them. I see a lot of stuff going into React applications now, with React specialists never knowing much about the rest of the stack. A lot of bad decisions are made and a lot of things happen in the front-end that shouldn't, IME. Likewise, if you sit in APIs all day and don't consider the impact of your decisions on the rest of the stack, it can result in design problems that could have been avoided.",

And at the end of the day, you want to find a balance that aligns with your career goals. If you want to learn more about which approach is right for you, I've written a post that covers this very topic that you might find helpful. Check it out here: [Should You Be a Software Generalist or Specialist?](https://danschaefer.dev/blog/should-you-be-a-software-generalist-or-specialist/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=comment&utm_campaign=r/experienceddevs)",
            "You are overthinking and experiencing a confirmation bias. This is a discussion where I don't know where to start. But let me start with confirming your bias and some food for thought :)\n\nWhen the technology evolves, user expectations increase, and so companies expectations for that particular skill tend to rise. I would have valued a front end engineer with basic css/html skill a lot higher 5 yrs back than I do now. Now, I expect every engineer to build a basic ui. And front end engineers, I expect them to improve that last bit of page performance I can improve, which you'll be able to do quickly if you had been investing that much time to know the deep knowledge through your xp and keep up with the latest developments. If you didn't, then it will take you more time.\n\nI wouldn't completely deny your observation (special over general) but that is a moot point imo when it comes to think about career. You always specialize over time.\n\nAnd this has nothing to do with the economy, but with the technology evolution. There are all sorts of projects companies are doing which require everything - specialized, full stack, and everything in between. \n\nWith experience, you end up specializing in few things over others. At 5 yrs xp, you should start looking into what is that specialization that will be relevant for at least few years.\n\nThe bottom line is\n\n### **Just be the top 1% of whatever domain you pick. Being top 1% of a niche is easier than being a top generalist.**\n\nAnd this is the best advice that can come out of this discussion for an experienced engineer",
            "I can only speak for myself but I want the smartest person I can find and I'll hire a smarter person that's thinking on their feet over the person who memorized everything. However, from the start I was looking for something specific to add to my team (React FE, Java BE, DB2, etc...). The company doesn't want to hire a java dev to fill a React position and wait a year or more for that dev to become an effective teammate. My team won't put up with it either as it would cause a distraction and lower morale.\n\nIt's important to generalize in a breadth of knowledge surrounding what you do but you should really dive deep into something to become an asset to your team because I'm going to pick the least useful person on my team when I'm asked who we can let go.\n\nAlso, that person who never really improves or pushes themselves to do better becomes a liability. There's no upward mobility and I can't defend rolling them over. Why waste everyone's time when I could foster someone who is more eager.",

But even if I had passed the technical interviews, I still would have had to go through team matching before getting a real offer, and it's questionable that a hiring manager would have been interested in my shallow generalist skills, pretty much all of it in system administration of a small number of servers, maintaining and adding features to C and C++ applications, and Python and Perl scripting to parse files or move files around or get some information out of a database.\n\nMy last attempt, I passed the phone screen but got stuck in the new \"soft team alignment\" process to match with a hiring manager before the onsite interview.

            "> And if the HM is looking for SRE, but you have React.js experience, you probably won't get a callback\n\nThat's fine, but the problem is with interview processes where they're hiring an Angular dev but you have React.js experience (and have done at TON of Vue stuff on the side)...but you haven't slung Angular professionally for a company so they hang up the call and reject you.\n\nTo a lesser extent: I have 2 CS degrees and 10 years SWE experience. At this point in someone's career they should understand the basics sufficiently to be able to onboard with most languages (as long as it's not something ridiculously esoteric like brainfuck) fairly easily. \n\nMy current job is backend Node/TypeScript/NestJS (as well as the usual React frontend stuff). Before that I was a PHP (CodeIgniter/Laravel) dev. I've also done some Java stuff on there side here and there. I reckon I can pass a Java technical interview and within a week or two get back up to speed with Java.\n\nI interviewed for a position with Chewy. I told them all this but because I didn't have \"professional experience\" with Java. That was the end of the call. They didn't care that I'd worked on personal android projects, they didn't care about all my other experience. They weren't interested. All they wanted was \"Java expert or GTFO.\"",

            "Big companies favour specialists, smaller companies favour generalists because they want to pay less for more.\n\nI understand that people want to have freedom to work wherever they want and try a lot of different things. But in my experience, most of the generalists suck. Sorry and I'm not talking about anyone here, but that's my experience.\n\nThey seem to know a lot, but in reality they know a little bit of each part and that's not enough in many situations.\n\nI've seen people saying in this topic that they've been rejected, well you're either not presenting himself properly or you don't have the experience the company is needing.\n\nI've already seen some generalists that are really great and can work in different areas very well. But that's not the reality of 90% of the generalists I've already worked or interviewed.",
            "It depends on what you mean by \"specialist.\" Where I work they talk about \"T-shaped developers\" by which they mean someone with deep knowledge and experience in one area, but broad experience across many other areas. \n\nExample A:  someone who is an expert on front-end development and browser programming, but also understands fundamentals of security, API design, databases, and can work efficiently in a shell.\n\nExample B: Someone who has a focus in security, but has broad experience in programming in more typical backend development roles, and has a complete understanding of fundamentals of what is happening in a browser with respect to the network stack.\n\nBoth A and B are generalists. They could do anything in the full system stack if needed, but they are really good at one or two of those things. Think of it like a jazz musician who can play any of the instruments in the band but their best one is the trumpet.\n\nI don't really think of this \"T-shaped developer\" as having a \"specialization\". A specialist is someone who may have a specialized (hint) degree in a sub field of CS or some other field like statistics. These people wouldn't be expected to know how to program at all, they would just be there to develop models, do R&D, and so on.",
            "> specialized engineers over generalists.\n\n\nAre you sure about this? Why then there's another source that swears that the current trend is favoring Fullstack developers over Frontend/Backend developers. Which is a way to say generalists over especialists.",
            "Yeah, but then they put the specialist on a team of similar function (front end, backend, etc) instead of cross functional teams and they deliver slower because they\u2019re constantly blocked by workers from other specialization.",
            "> I wish it weren't the case but this is just what I've observed. \n\nWhat's the issue with this being the case? Don't we all have a particular sub-field that we prefer to live in? Or am I just weird and most people prefer being generalists.",
            "So your question focuses on interviewing and I admit I haven\u2019t interviewed in the non-ZIRP era.\n\nWhat I can say is that in the non-interview day to day, a good way to demonstrate value is to have the flexibility of being a generalist while \u201ccollecting specialist badges\u201d throughout your career.\n\nFor example, I\u2019m pretty much a generalist. Each place I\u2019ve stopped that has been a new stack, new frameworks and languages, new way of doing things. I\u2019ve been able to adapt to those fairly quickly.\n\nBut I\u2019ve also \u201cspecialized\u201d in build tooling and devx as a secondary skill throughout my career. At every point, inevitably I become the guy who debugs my teammates\u2019 dev environment and does all the build tooling and CI improvements. At my first job as a junior I was kind of forced into this, and I remember distinctly being kinda annoyed (I just want to build products!). But then at my subsequent jobs these tasks would pop out and I\u2019d naturally say, hey I\u2019ve done this before and can take care of it. And at each job, I\u2019ve been able to get better and better at this specific skillset.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say here is, I think ideally you have a couple of specializations that define you as you reach the 5-10 year range. The difference perhaps now is that you actually have to sell these specializations on your resume whereas before you might have skipped it since the job market was easier.",
            "Being a specialist vs a generalist is not about being how smart you are, but how do you remember the important details. Here is the thing, regardless of how smart you are, you don't know that X is possible if you don't realize that X is out there, and that kind of knowledge can only come in being a specialist. Reading meticulous documentation, spec, and standards. As an example, take a look at [web.dev](https://web.dev) and see how massive the knowledge is presented over there, and that is just for frontend. Massive, massive, massive, and it keeps evolving. And yet they say FE is for code monkey. Bullshit. Absolutely not true.\n\nThere is a caveat though. You should not become a specialist in say, React, because those knowledge are temporal. This is what a lot of people are mistaken. They think they can specialize in React, Angular. But you should be specialist in say, Front End.\n\nHowever, even being a specialist vs generalist are not immune to market conditions. In majority of companies, the skill ceiling NEEDED for (majority) of companies out there for Front End, is lower, so lots of companies out there might not need very sophisticated Frontend Engineer and prefer fullstack (i.e, Backend Engineer with some Frontend experience). Even if those companies are hiring for Frontend, those companies won't necessarily want to pay top dollar for very sophisticated Frontend engineer because they won't need the skills that come with it. As a result, if you wanna get paid top dollar as a Frontend engineer, you need to go to big companies that can/will squeeze your Frontend skills and push it to its boundary, like in Facebook, Figma, Google, Netflix, etc.\n\nAnd no, you can't be an expert in a week. This is not Marvel Universe and you are not Tony Stark.",
            "> Why would someone hire a top-tier React dev when their company is looking for a Java dev and there are dozens of top-tier Java devs in the interview loop?\n\nwhat is a top-tier Java dev? You don't know until 6 months after they start working. The interview process is very difficult to really know.",
            "It's always been like this. As someone who likes variety I had to come to the same realization.. about the same point in my career too. There will always be jobs for generalists and that is not necessarily true for specialists when some tech falls out of favor and they fail to stay a step ahead. But generalist jobs don't, never have and never will pay well. It has more to do with the type of employer who hires most generalists--smaller with lower budgets.\n\nAnother point is what is meant by \"specialist\". Due to the breadth of tech a specialist isn't necessarily a super deep expert in one specific tech. A front-end developer is a specialist, a data engineer is as \"specialist\", DevOps, QA ... all know a bunch of tools for their role. In the tech world a specialist is just not a generalist.. which would be somebody who dabbled in all of these areas. That's why I would watch out for \"full stack developer\". In 2002 that was perhaps a specialist role, now you're trying to do way too many things and you are a generalist. The role is real and it can be done don't get me wrong but only on a very small scale. You're spread too thin and don't be surprised when you find yourself working for a micky mouse mom & pop shop making super lame phone games for peanuts. The one way to make it pay BIG is to join a startup as they need people who can slap stuff together fast and wear many hats in a single day. That's a slog and a gamble of course and not for everyone.",
            "It really depends on the company and place. Larger multiple nationals who can afford to have specialists lying around or hire at a premium in need prefer specialists. \nStartups need generalists with a very strong core of programming concepts which they can adapt to the platform and framework. \n\nThis is in my limited experience tho.

        "content": "How did you become a principal?  By accident?  By design?  How did you stay motivated? Please hint at your path if you have a moment.  \n  \nAnyone else in late career contemplating how they got to this wasteland where as an individual contributor, you are tired and no longer willing to invest the effort to go to the next rung?  Companies are just NOT willing to invest in their people and without reciprocation from them, it is all about self-motivation.  Earlier in my career, I never let this bother me and forged ahead.  But now, 20 years on, I have a handful of years left until I am probably forced to retire. Now that I can \\_possibly\\_ reach the star level of principal, I can't really get motivated.  When I was younger, I saw older developers become jaded and I said I would never become that.  Now here I am with similar weariness and a bit of anger.\n\n  \nLong ago I fell into software development because I was obsessed with understanding computers and how they work.  \n\nIt wasn't about developing a well-paying career.  I was mostly concerned with mastery of something I felt was worth learning about.\n\nNow that I've been doing this work since about 2001, I find I am just not interested in architecture nor being a \"leader\".  \n\nI stopped to examine why I feel this way.  Is it imposter syndrome?  Is it lack of confidence?  Is it lack of mastery?\n\nI have assessed the following list of real possibilities:\n\n1.   I have learned to hate software development in the corporate environment.  Politics, Agile performed poorly, the pressure of shareholders from the top have all conspired against my love.\n2.  I am not good enough to be a principal.  On code reviews, I am always missing some detail (the scanners catch code complexity, places where I could have applied code re-use, etc., missing a SOLID principle here and there)\n3. I've never stayed long enough at any one company to develop deep and wide domain knowledge.  Either the companies  technical areas were silo'd, the opportunities were there but the pay wasn't increasing with inflation...so hop and skip every two to three years.\n4. Lack of deliberate investment in my career. I just don't have the motivation to invest in tech stacks that change every couple of years.  Sure, the stack itself isn't the basis for a principal - however, the stack has impact on other decisions, practices, and types of companies.\n5. Now that certain technical areas are like a natural extension of my brain, the management wants me to spread out my focus into say, front end.  Fighting back seems pointless.  I learn just enough to be a mediocre front end dev and then I get stuck doing that work for awhile until I get the chutzpah to fight back and go back to my better skillset, the back end.\n6. As a woman, I find that there is covert and overt prejudice.  Investing in me requires some kind of mentoring and it is always a male who has no interest in doing so.  As I become less \"sexually viable\", this becomes more the case year after year.  I stopped trying to develop advocates and just do the work.  I know this is dumb.  I am human though, and banging my head on brick walls over the years has been...a test of endurance.\n\n**EDIT/Update**:  I am humbled by the responses here.  Very thoughtful, inspired and concrete ways I can approach my career.  I can\u2019t thank you enough.  I had no idea how angry and defeated I had let myself become. \n\nI have so much joy and contribution I can give once I get past this state of being.  \n\nAn emotional tide has washed over me as I remember the passion and interest I once had.

You sound tired and possibly burnt out. Getting joy back to your daily work would possibly be a better goal than chasing a principal title.\n\n>hate software development in the corporate environment\n\nI used to work in a small company, where we managed to recruite good senior devs for lower salary than big companies, because we had smooth, common sense dev process, high team morale and no politics.\n\nCompany size is not a guarantee for a good environment, but there are places with true agile and (almost) no politics.\n\n>I am not good enough to be a principal\n\nSo what?

            "There is a lot to unpack here. To be honest, your title is a question but your post is a story that sounds like personal burnout and frustration with an employer. \n\nSaying you\u2019ll be \u201cforced to retire\u201d in a couple years after 20 YOE screams burnout. I don\u2019t think this is really about being a principal engineer.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to become a principal engineer. You are not a failure if you don\u2019t achieve a specific title. If you were attached to the title then you could probably apply to small startups for a year until someone gave you the title. Upon acquiring the title, you\u2019d realize that nothing has changed and you\u2019re still the same developer. Titles alone aren\u2019t an absolute indicator of your abilities.\n\nSecond, much of your post complains about companies not \u201cinvesting\u201d in you to get to Principal. It\u2019s hard to know exactly what this means but it goes somewhat against what people associate with Principal engineering positions: The higher the title, the less you\u2019re expected to need the company to guide and mentor you. At the highest IC levels you are expected to be the one doing the mentoring, acquiring knowledge on your own, and setting technical direction for the company. If you have high expectations for the company mentoring and guiding you, that could be in conflict with the expectations of Principal Engineer roles.\n\nJust throwing it out there as a common impediment I see in people who go expect the path to Principal/Staff to be a repeat of how they went from Intern to Junior to Senior. What got you here won\u2019t get you there.\n\nFinally, you mention lack of motivation multiple times. You can blame whoever you want for the lack of motivation, but at the end of the day an unmotivated developer isn\u2019t going to be included in candidates for promotion to Principal. If you require a lot of external motivation and guiding input from the company, that\u2019s not something the company can afford to promote into important positions.

            "TBH I'm somewhat disillusioned on Staff / Principal lately. Most organizations don't have a culture to make the typical [archetypes of Staff / Principal](https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes/) work well. IE it's hard to really own the technical direction of an area if Managers+Directors in that org are \\_really\\_ the ones driving a given direction (ie they're technical) and your ideas are just seen as a distraction from that de-facto structure. Indeed, perhaps the role as envisioned is ill conceived - as if we're giving people supposed \"power\" over an area without actually giving them power to direct people to do something.\n\nIn my experience that Staff/Principal are focused on SMEs in machine learning, or infra, etc. Where the candidates want to be paid more than the normal pay scale, and calling someone staff/principal is the loophole hiring managers can use to make that happen.\n\nI'm not complaining necessarily, but this is just the reality that seems to be happening.",

Lack of headcount, lack of collaboration, etc. Going solo and building things via heroic efforts in the face of that ended up taking a large personal toll in terms of stress+work/life balance.  \n\\* I began to work with managers and directors as peers to try to address those issues - getting motivated engineers working together, improving hiring, finding space for teams to take risks, etc..

            "> I am not good enough to be a principal. On code reviews, I am always missing some detail (the scanners catch code complexity, places where I could have applied code re-use, etc., missing a SOLID principle here and there)\n\nThis one confuses me.  Being a principal (which I am) isn't a matter of making no mistakes.  It's knowing how to recover from them and knowing how to not repeat them (i.e., learn from them).\n\nIn this respect it's no different from the difference between, say, an expert woodworker and an amateur -- both make mistakes; the expert just knows how to recover from it while the amateur will throw it out and start over.\n\nEveryone misses something.  After 24 years, I still do.  So you fix it and move on.  I'll bet I could find something wrong in every PR I've ever done; most of the time I just let it slide as not worth fighting over.\n\n> As a woman, I find that there is covert and overt prejudice. Investing in me requires some kind of mentoring and it is always a male who has no interest in doing so. As I become less \"sexually viable\", this becomes more the case year after year. I stopped trying to develop advocates and just do the work. I know this is dumb. I am human though, and banging my head on brick walls over the years has been...a test of endurance.\n\nSexism (and ageism) is a legitimate problem in the industry.  Reacting to that is not dumb.  That said, someone handing you a mentor who has no interest in mentoring is a whole other level of idiocy on your manager.  That's their fault, not yours.  Small comfort when you're not getting mentored, I know, but you have no reason to be down on yourself over this.\n\nIn general and as others have said, this does sound like burnout.  But please allow me to list some notes here based on my experience:\n\n* Titles in the industry are fluid and non-standard.  Senior, Lead, Principal... even Manager.  They are whatever the company says they are.  As an example, I'm a Principal, but I'm functionally a Lead -- I do a lot of leadership work and only code about 10% of my time.  At my last company, I was a Lead but functionally a Manager -- I did virtually no coding and spent a lot of time managing my team down to the yearly performance reviews, complete with direct reports.  Before *that* I was an Architect who was an IC that no one wanted to listen to, and before *that* I was a Senior who was really a Lead, coding and managing the team in equal amounts.  Don't focus on titles; focus on the work you want to do.\n* I got here by speaking up.  I like to say I ended up in leadership by annoyance -- I got tired of everyone going in circles so eventually I stood up and said \"Let's do X and stop arguing about it\".  Suddenly I'm a leader.  Then I ran with it -- found what I liked and applied for jobs doing that.  I've found I'm happy leading teams, but I also know I have a limit -- I have no interest in the C-Suite, for example.  I expect I'll end my career somewhere around the VP level.\n* If you're getting pigeonholed into work you don't want to do, look for places that offer what you want.  I was once hired by a company that wanted dev and SDET work.  I told them I could do both but would prefer to do dev.  So they jammed me into test automation until I finally realized they'd never move me out of it and left.  Look for jobs that match what you want, not what they're offering.\n* Finally, remember that terminal levels are a thing and there's absolutely *no shame* in being in one.  I've had developers who wanted to remain there and never get promoted.  They were happy that their salaries would never go beyond a certain point (aside from COL increases, I presume), and I was happy to have them on board, as were my managers.  (For the record for anyone unfamiliar with the term, \"terminal levels\" are  levels where a company is happy to keep someone around indefinitely instead of taking an \"up or out\" mentality.  I've also heard them called \"parking levels\".  Senior is usually one of them -- it's a place where one can be trusted to be handed work and get it done with minimal supervision.)\n\nLook, I don't know if it will help -- and I don't know you or where you work -- but I'd be happy to discuss general career advice if you ever feel like you need it.  But even if you don't want to, I'll say this: look at what you do and what part of it you enjoy.  Look for opportunities to do what you enjoy.  Places are out there that will accomodate!  You just might need to be patient.",

            "I am currently a Principal SWE.  I have also been a CTO, VP (2x) and a Distinguished Engineer in my career.  \n\nI've been at this 27 years, and I'm starting to feel the burnout like OP.  I used to work late into the night almost 7 days a week year round for the first 22 ish years of my career to learn new things, build new stuff, and do work for clients.  Then my kid got cancer and work became a distant priority and I got used to not working into the wee hours of the night anymore.  \n\nI definitely burned out, but also learned I can get this jon done without killing myself physically and mentally.\n\nI can learn what I need to on the job.  I already know enough of everything to get by and I can design solid, scalable enterprise systems in my sleep.  There's always more to learn, but at this level, its more about teaching, picking lanes to work in, helping solve tough problems and the biggest one - mitigating risk.  Those for me tend to be way more important  than it is picking a particular framework or actually coding hands on.  My coding skills are fine, but I'm way more valuable helping solve tough design challenges, scaling, architectural, or integration type problems.  \n\nMy biggest issue is I get stuck in meetings 3/4 of the week.  Its hard to get anything done technically on my own due to that so I'm working on calendar management and refusing to join pointless meetings so I can get real work done.  It helps a lot.  If you get to this level you need to get good at managing your time as much as anything else.\n\nIts worth it to get here, but if you can get paid well to have less responsibility that's nice too.",
            "I got to Principal via a circuitous route that involved lots of architecture roles as well as development roles at various levels.  It also involved being recruited by someone who had worked with me previously and respected what I can do both big picture architecture-wise and boots-on-ground coding wise specifically to hire on as a Principal.\n\nThe reality is the majority of developers won't ever be strong enough for a principal role.  It's not a situation where you input X years of experience and Principal title comes out of the coke machine.  Promotion paths are theoretically intended to be a pyramid where after a certain level only the strongest make it through.  Theoretically that includes staff level as well.  (And yes, some orgs have principal and not staff, some have staff and not principal, the lines are muddy).  I would say most devs won't make it past senior on either the IC track OR the management track, and that's ok.  A qualified senior dev is a valuable colleague in and of themselves, they just are focused on smaller scale stuff than a staff/principal with less \"force multiplying\" required.\n\nMost of the points you make are really laying out many the reasons why you really don't qualify to be a principal.  In addition to having the aptitude to learn the skills, I think you kind of have to care.  I think it's easier to be an effective principal if you have gone deep and gone wide, not necessarily on the same things, but you've learned what works and what doesn't and you've added every success and every failure from going deep to a little information cache that helps you analyze options and make decisions, and every new technology and business scenario you get from going wide to that box of tricks as well.\n\nExcellent communication skills are also required because of the need to be a force multiplier.  A lot of super strong technologists can't communicate well enough to help grow others, and they may never become Principals either.  Practically speaking, you have to be able to build connections with enough people at high enough level to get promoted to this level as well.\n\nTo your point 6 - I'm a 50 year old woman, and I'm pretty sure my \"sexual viability\" (to use your term) is both non-existent and irrelevant.  I've had some great mentorship over the years (mostly, but not all, from men).   Sexism exists for sure but it's not everywhere.  Some environments are far worse than others for this.  I feel I've had less problems with this than most, but not none.  I've managed to gain the respect of enough people over the years to overcome it though, part of it through luck I'm sure.\n\nIn summary, it sounds like you aren't very ambitious and unless you have both a big adjustment in ambition, effort, and capability, you're probably not going to promote past senior dev.  But it's ok to be a senior dev, just at least try to do the best job you can in the role that you have and stay at least somewhat current on new techs so you can keep as you are til retirement and don't end up obsolete in the process.",

My top-level answer was that after some changes in the company, I was no longer enjoying the role and decided to leave. This was true but not the whole story.

If your interviewer asks the generic variant, just pretend they asked my more specific variant instead, and frame your answer as if you were answering my question instead of the generic variant. \n\nWhy is this better? Because you get to talk about YOUR MOTIVATIONS instead of focusing on bad-mouthing your last employer. You can still express ideas like, \"I am looking for high-integrity, inspirational leadership\", or maybe \"I want to join a more rigorous company, so I can learn how to operate with higher standards\"... There's so many ways to communicate your ideas, without having to focus on bad-mouthing, but you do need to learn how frame a conversation (or change how it is initially framed), instead of letting yourself have a bad conversation with someone, just because a lazy recruiter didn't offer you the ideal frame off the bat... So what if the first prompt is not ideal, you can influence it, since interviews are a joint dialogue! Proactively shaping a conversation to take the framing that most benefits you, is actually the secret trick to higher level interviewing (as a middle manager or above), vs just taking what is given to you and locking yourself into that initial frame.",

I tried to voice my concerns but it became clear that the decision had been made and it was not going to change. \n\nI have a lot of respect for the leadership team, and I know they made what they felt was the best decision for the business. Unfortunately it was a direction that I just didn\u2019t feel comfortable being a part of. \n\nI\u2019m heartbroken because I really thought I would be at that company for a long time, but at the end of the day my gut told me that my discomfort would make it difficult for me to lead my team in a way that aligned with the company\u2019s expectations, so I made the difficult decision to cut ties instead of sticking it out. It was a very tough decision that I didn\u2019t take lightly.\n\nI learned from this experience that it\u2019s very important to me to find a company whose corporate values strongly align with mine, and from what I\u2019ve learned about this company so far, I think we could be a good fit. I like XYZ that I\u2019ve read/heard people say.\u201d\n\nFrame your leaving as the best decision for the business, not just for you.\n\nIf people want even more details, share as much as you can but keep it focused on the business reasons behind the decisions the company made, and make it clear that you understand the reason why leadership felt that was the right way to go.

            ">The company was about to implement a couple of changes that I consider unethical and against my values, so I left. First time in my long career that I did that.\n\nI've done this, or had it happen to me, 2 times in my 10 career in start ups. I learned from a corporate ax welder long ago that when there's a big change at a company (layoff, re-structure, fundamental change in mission/product) people fall into roughly three equally sized groups: those that fully embrace the change, those that will \"go along to get along\" and muddle threw but ultimately stay on mission, and those that take a look at the new state of things, and just decide \"nope\".\n\nI've been in all three groups, in about even proportion, it's just natural that sometimes you'll like that change and agree, or other times you don't like it, and should really leave.\n\nI've always gotten away with poising it like this: I joined a company and was excited to work a on, but unfortunately that mission subsequently failed and required changes, and I'm looking for opportunities that are more aligned with my personal beliefs, which I believe is your company. Say it in your own words, but don't bring up scary words like \"unethical\", but poise it as a matter of direction and alignment.\n\nThat's not always going to work, but in start ups, people understand that there are radical changes to companies, and that some of those changes will alienate workers. That's really a management failure, not a failure on your part. They also know that their current mission might not be what they are doing in 3-5 years, but you need to hire folks that are aligned with the mission as it exists, and that's exactly what is attracting you.\n\nIMO, it's always okay to leave a project when the fundamentals of what you are doing change. IMO, if the original company wanted you to stay, they'd be throwing out a massive amount of stock at you to make it worth your while. If they didn't, then you really aren't that important to them, and it's okay to leave.",

Right or wrong, the two or three people who feel one way are going to be happier moving to a team that feels like they do or are open to suggestions. \n\nI worked at a big place where about eight people felt like I did, seven of them left.

I was among a number of people who could see it coming and approached the CEO but <gesture>. Half our C group quit in one week, I left when I could and ensured that my team had options. One chose to stay for a while longer but the others all landed nice new roles at higher salaries.\"\n\n\nI'm deliberately generalizing the issue and glossing over it.

I pull in the fact that others quit, the story I'm telling isn't about me, it's the company that went wrong. Finally I pivot on to my leadership, how I led my team through the transition.\n\n\nI believe the team element is the line they remember. Typically the next question is one about team management.\u00a0\n\n\nI suggest you do something similar. As others have said I would emphasize the change rather than the absolute ethical position. That's the crux of it but also because people tend to judge ethical actions against their own ethical positions, and you have no idea what those are. But broaden the story, what did you do before you quit? What did others do? As a manager how did you communicate the company changes to your people? How did you communicate your departure? And why did you do these things, what do you want to communicate about yourself and your values?\n\n\nI would advice against pulling the NDA or can't disclose card.

If they press for details, you can politely deflect by saying you'd prefer not to discuss specifics out of respect for your former employer, but that you're excited to find a role that's a better fit.\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in overthinking how to explain every career move. But at the end of the day, most interviewers care more about your skills and what you can bring to their company than the minutiae of why you left your last job.

Many people work on informational CRUD sites and AI will crush that. You can look at meta quest sales, VR is growing and arguably in a real spot to succeed. People think because it has a hype cycle where there's a lot of hype that doesn't materialize all at once that a new tech paradigm won't be successful, yet we're all on here after the dotcom bubble. \n\nThere are immediate skills you can have:\n\n1. Basic datastructures and algorithms. Those who say they never use them are usually web developers that might have a questionable future. I personally use the basics all of the time. I don't mean do leetcode either, even though it helps, just get to know the date structures well enough that you know what to use and when.\n\n2. low level skills. Understand network protocols and a lower level programming language. Understand the computer. (This is where I haven't fully gotten to in my years in, but am learning.)\n\n3. Software design patterns. You need to be able to recognize that there could be a use for one and be able to have a good enough sense to use a few commons or google a few others. \n\n4. Clean code/SOLID. I'm not a fan of this one, but most companies are. \n\nIt doesn't matter what anyone says, you've now just asserted that you're farther than skilled devs in a particular language if they haven't done that. Chances are you need to learn the above once. \n\nFor hype stuff: just buy a course and watch it. You don't need to to become an VR developer, but you can go easily watch an Unreal engine tutorial and know at least what's going on. The same goes with AI and LLMs. You don't need to train your own model, but knowing how one works is great and helpful. You might come across something like this ever two years. It's really not a big deal.\n\nThen for keeping your skills up, develop a person project where you might put 20 hours into it a month. The project should be something you like, want to learn, and that challenges you.",

        "title": "Need input on potential career change from IC to EM",
        "content": "So, I've been at my current company for almost 6 years now. It's a big multi-national corporation and I've had the chance of moving laterally across different Business Units and coding in different projects. For the past 3 years I've been working on this BU where I've moved up from SW Eng to a SW Architect (which is basically more design / technical roadmap & mentoring than actual coding).\n\nThe problem is that I've hit the ceiling- in terms of learning and career progression.  Let me explain. For better or worse, I believe I know the current product inside-out and there are no new things for me to learn. Also, even my slightest attempt to introduce new tech, that would improve some of our performance issues, gets blocked by management due to business priorities... In addition, there's no other technical position above my current one that I could move up to (the company is more management oriented when it comes to carving out employees' career paths) and moving to another BU is (for the time being) not feasible.\n\nOn the other hand there are some good things stemming from my current situation. For one, there's no stress at all. I'm totally autonomous, work on my own pace and have no LM pushing deadlines down my throat. Of course, there are project deadlines but my point is that I'm handling them myself- don't have a manager above my head constantly asking for updates and what not. This situation leads to me having a great deal of freedom in the way I work also allowing me to work remotely (even pre-COVID19) whenever I want. This also leads to me being able to completely shut off when I log off and not work outside my normal working hours (I mention this as an advantage because I understand that this is a huge deal in our industry).\n\nAs the title says I'm torn as to what my next step should be. That's why, in an effort to maybe clear things up a bit,  I'm seeking other experienced devs' input on my situation.\n\n**Option #1:**\n\n\\- Stay at my current job. This would allow me to (probably) coast for the rest of my time here and enjoy a totally autonomous, relaxed, low-stress way of life; three elements that are not that easy to find in the industry. As far as the cons go, well, they were pretty much explained above.\n\n**Option #2:**\n\n\\- Move to a new company as an Engineering/Tech Manager. This option would capitalize on the skills I've gained in my current position (tech management of a distributed team, people and tech managing of teams etc). **Pros**: More pay (for some reason management pays more, on avg, than a technical role), more autonomy than a s/w eng. position; better chances of climbing that career ladder as more positions are available to managers (I'm a type A personality...); more impact (?) as I will have a saying on key product/strategy decisions; less stress than an IC (I'm not really sure of this but I think that,on average, the stress of actually building the product is less than managing the guys who build the product); pay is more than an IC **Cons:** I'm not really sure that spending most of my day in meetings and creating ppt presentations will make for an interesting day to day job; not that many open positions for eng. management where I live (this means that If one gets fired there won't be many other similar jobs to go to); Less flexibility than IC in terms of remote work, time off, leave etc\n\n**Option #3:**\n\n\\- Move to a new company as an IC. **Pros:** Will learn new stuff/technologies and day to day will be more interesting than being a manager; More flexibility wrt working from home, working hours etc; Not (much) overtime; Because of the previous points, I reckon that my way of life will be more stable (in contrast to being a manager where there's a tendency to work past 5/6pm); generally, I like experimenting with new technologies and I like implementing mini projects on my spare time so I think by doing that professionally, it'll be a good use of my time **Cons:** less pay than a manager (again this is due to the country/market I'm in), will probably not be that much autonomous due to having a manager above my head and will for sure not be that much autonomous as I currently am, I think that the rush from using new technologies, and building exciting stuff will eventually fade away and in the long run this position will end up being only about fixing bugs. This means that I'll eventually have to move to a new job thus being part of a huge rat race; higher stress- associated with having to keep up with deadlines; unless this job's about a product/service that I'll be heavily invested in (slim chances), I think I'll not be having such big of an impact and will be just another cog in the wheel; I believe I won't ever be *that* good so as to climb to any position. This is due to the fact that there are other devs who are better than me and will have more experience in the new company. So indeed another cog in the wheel...\n\nSo, experienced developers of this sub-reddit, what would you do If you were in my shoes? Any advice? Have you ever been in a similar situation?",

Moving to a role where you don\u2019t write any code anymore and you manage people can make a lot of folks unhappy. I made the move consciously and have never been happier, but it was a huge change. I was lucky to have a few mentors that helped prepare me for that role. \n\nIf it\u2019s just about money, I\u2019d look for another IC role. You\u2019ve seemingly got the experience on that end and it\u2019s what will make you happier. There is still more growth to be had there, and it\u2019s better to make the move to management with eyes wide open as to what that means. It\u2019s better than doing that for a few years and hating it and trying to find your way back and realizing your coding has gotten a bit rusty.",

Do you want to do more challenging stuff? Do you want to be responsible over more things? Both?\n\nIf you just want more challenge, I suggest remaining an IC and asking your manager for more challenging projects, explore a transfer of team, or join a new company. If you want some of the latter, you may want to explore management, especially if you\u2019re already at a high IC level such as architect, where you\u2019re already responsible for a great deal of things (architecture, onboarding, eng culture to a large degree). If you still find yourself pining to have even more or even sole responsibility then you might have topped out in this role, especially if what you want more influence over is team, product, company or business related.",
            "Management because of not being bored at the current position seems to be a bad idea mainly because managerial track requires different skills and contains different responsibility.

As a manager you would need to be responsible for the project and your team. So a lot of mentoring, understanding your peers and employees, tracking your subordinates\u2019 career growth. In some places being manager would mean that you dont code anymore.\n\nSo you need to change your mindset and evaluate your skills and mindsets. Definitely not for everyone, especially when they dont like to take care of people and teams. It is better to move to another company which a higher ladder for ICs.",

You don't get people to buy into an idea by just... saying it.  There is definitely politicking involved.  I am not in as much as a pure manager but it is definitely far more than zero!  I don't think you can reasonably be at this level unless you are some deep specialist without acting in some managerial capacity.\n\nYou will mentor in either gig.  I mentor 3 other folks indirectly (they will ask me for advice, etc.)  I will spend a fair bit of time coaching them.  I will help them code better by pair programming or via code reviews. Helping them structure some of their work to keep them on the rails.  The difference between myself and a manager is more around motivation.  If I can get them to do lower lever work I don't have to and can focus on higher level concerns and have broader influence.  A manager needs them to be good because they are relying on them to get things done as their rating is based on the performance of others.  Personal problems someone has don't directly effect me (I care but don't have to deal with it).  I can't hire and fire people, I can ask for resources for a task but ultimately resourcing is managerial.\n\nI am honestly not coding as much these days but can always hop in.  My work is really more around architecting systems (documentation and presentations are big here), doing tech talks to help educate our engineers, scoping work, mentoring, and convincing management to do certain slots of work.  \n\nI am effectively a manager but with softer power and different motivations.  \n\nJust something to consider as an alternative path.

I push the branch to the remote and open a PR/MR to run the pipeline.\n\nRecently, while collaborating on a feature, a peer insisted that I shouldn't change the history of my branch. He argued that keeping the history intact is better for collaboration since it allows him to track my changes easily. I understand his point, but he was also against manually squashing commits before merging, preferring GitLab to handle it automatically. Moreover, he believes that no one should ever change the history of their personal branches, even when working solo. To me, this feels like an unnecessary restriction on my workflow.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?",

We always collaborate on feature branches and if we need to do something squashable that would be a story branch we create for that purpose. They have different prefixes on the git branch.",
            ">Moreover, he believes that no one should ever change the history of their personal branches, even when working solo\n\nKind of a weirdly strong take. I mean I generally try to limit tampering with history on my own branch, prefer to let GL/GH/BB do the squash, but that's mostly because I don't care \\_that\\_ much about my history that I feel the need to editorialize it like that. I can't see any reason why I'd want to stop someone else from doing it unless we were collaborating on a branch. I guess you could just not push your changes and modify history to your heart's content until you're ready to MR",

Especially in a PR, where reviewers have suggested changes and you push a new commit with those changes.  That way they can just view the singular commit rather than have to review the whole PR again to see if your changes are in there.  \n\nOne of the most annoying things as a reviewer is having to re-review things wholesale every single time.  We had a junior who liked to refactor and redesign his code wholesale whenever we suggested even the most minor of nits.  That's not your problem here, though, I'm just digressing.\n\nKeeping history intact *before* you've pushed the branch is just a matter of your own personal preference.  I came to git from using mercurial, where history was unchangeable, so I had learned to structure my work into multiple, easily digestible commits that told a logical story of progress to aid reviewers.  I actually quite enjoyed it and came to see some value in it, especially when I'm able to write more salient commit messages to associate them with specific changes.  Maybe that's what your reviewer wants?  With that being said, I also learned to review and value the squashed commit as the unit of work that's going to come into your codebase, and you get to see it in its whole integrated glory.",

Once code review begins (responses to code review feedback get new commits)  \n2. If we start working on a branch together (once both people actually have commits in the branch). That happens pretty rarely, though - and even then we're usually communicating enough that squashing is negotiated rather than forbidden.\n\nOut of curiosity, how long do your branches typically run / how big are the tickets you're working on?

Some times, I do and have seen many people do commits to show certain types of changes in separate commit (but they cannot be merged separately) to make it easier to review. In those cases, they would even when they address review comments, they maintain the same commit structure. I feel it is overkill, but fighting over it is worse than any other options put together.  \n  \nNow, github has squash and merge. I don't know about gitlab. But many times I prefer to squash manually because as I could craft the commit message correctly.",
            "who cares what you do on your branch? I'd rather see clean logical commits that build rather than a clusterfuck of broken noise, confusion, and weird ordering because you didn't tidy up after yourself.",
            "It sounds like the problem arose because your peer was building something that was downstream of your changes. Their work was blocked while they waited for your branch, so they branched off of your branch to allow their work to proceed. It sounds like you were unaware of this at the time because they believed it went without saying that any commit that had landed in source control was eternal.\n\nThen, as you continued work on your branch, you amended a commit upstream of their branch and force-pushed, orphaning their branch.\n\nExpecting a merge-based workflow, they resolved the difference by merging your branch, which created a very messy git history for their branch and a mess of merge conflicts because they now had two copies of your commits. This would have been annoying for me to fix and I can imagine it would've seemed insurmountable to someone who was not comfortable with `git rebase -i ...`.\n\nIf I've accurately understood the sequence of events, I would not describe this as a problem of git branch management at all. My own preference is for a branching strategy similar to what you describe, and I would be prepared to explain that opinion, but I think that's beside the point.\n\nThere are two primary lessons (or at least, starting points for further investigation) that I take away from this conflict:\n\n1. Whatever your team is doing for daily standup warrants further investigation. The seeming problem here is not that there was a difference in branching strategies; it's that two people were doing work on the same branch without having agreed upon a branching strategy. This is precisely the sort of thing I would want to bring up as a parking lot topic in my DSU, and something I would expect to be brought up. I'm curious what communication occurred prior to the failed merge, and what led to relevant information being excluded. Is DSU perceived as a status report to higher-ups rather than an appropriate venue for these sorts of discussions?\n2. Merge requests need to be smaller and happen earlier. There was a point where your feature was complete enough for your coworker to meaningfully begin downstream work, but not so complete that you were ready to submit it for code review and get it merged into the trunk. How did that happen? If I had to make a guess, I would expect that your project has a policy of making exactly one merge request per ticket/issue, and your ticket was for the complete feature.\n\nIf you were free to make a merge request with the smallest amount of changes that could be reasonably reviewed, this conflict would likely not have happened because your colleague would have been branching off of work that had already landed in the trunk. That could happen by decoupling merge requests from tickets or by making smaller tickets. Perhaps an initial ticket to stub out the external API of your code unit followed by an implementation ticket that could be executed concurrently with your coworker's ticket which consumed that API?",

            "Rewriting history has some benefits and negatives. It's important to understand the various perspectives for different roles and how rewriting history impacts them. Generally rewriting history is a benefit for non-development tasks. Cherry-picking, revert, testing, and managing release features are easier the more atomic a feature is. Generally keeping the history is better for team development as it is a constant shared history that everyone agrees upon and demonstrates learned lessons and incremental progress. If I'm reviewing a MR and ask for changes I can easily verify those changes if they're in a new commit on top of the previous one. If the author rewrote history I'll need to review everything again because I don't know if some extra changes were slipped in as well.\n\nUltimately the question of \"Is the branch private or shared?\" should be the deciding factor. If the branch is your private branch that no one should be looking at, it doesn't matter what you do there. But if the branch is supposed to be shared with other people then you shouldn't rewrite the history. That's forcing other people to actively react to the changes in history in addition to their own work.\n\nA good perspective to keep in mind is asking \"Do we allow this behavior in the main/master branch and why?\".",

Rebasing against master is encouraged even, since merge commits aren\u2019t allowed. For PR comments or anything else that would need to be changed after the PR is open, there\u2019s no problem with amending your commit and force-pushing it, although if it makes sense to have multiple commits then that\u2019s fine too. It\u2019s common courtesy for people who aren\u2019t the one primarily working on the branch to not push anything to it unless they get permission from the that person.\n\nIf the feature branch model is being used, then everything I just described applies to task branches, which then have PRs opened to the feature branch instead of to master. Then for the feature branch it\u2019s common courtesy to let the others who are merging into the feature branch know if you\u2019re going to rebase it against master, and to ask them before you do anything weird to it. As an example of what that might be, one of our seniors felt the need to re-write the history of a feature branch so that all tests pass in every commit, and so that they the commits would make more sense sequentially. Dealing with the fallout from that entailed committing what you were working on and cherry-picking it onto a copy of the new feature branch, which then became your new task branch.

In 2022, I quit to start my own business in a different industry (game dev)\n3. Before I quit, I was confident that  - in the \"worst case\" - I'd be able to find a job in late 2023/early 2024\n4. In early 2024, I got serious for finding a job again. However, I \"failed\" repeatedly, including letting a golden remote opportunity slip by\n5. Finally, 5 months ago I made the original post as I was down in the dumps wondering about future possibilities\n\n**tl;dr: I found a job as a remote mid-level engineer at Microsoft**\n\nHi all, apologies for the delay. I was fortunate to sign my new position in the first week of August and start in the middle of August, but then I kept procrastinating this promised update post as I wanted to make it fancy.\n\nDone is better than perfect. So time to jump straight into a quick timeline of events:\n\n1. After the last post, I took the various advice into account. There was a LOT of great advice (ty all!), and most importantly it was *very* uplifting! Gave me the energy to go back at it for months\n2. From April 29th to June 20th (so after the prior post), I applied to \\~95 jobs which were found nearly all through online sites like LinkedIn. Lots of mistakes & lessons here but these were all job descriptions I qualified for.\n3. For general results: Mass majority did not reach out whatsoever, rejections were *very* slow to come in, and I had about \\~3 separate follow ups that led to 1 pre-screen rejection, 1 post-screen rejection, and 1 contract ghosting (which I had cooking since November and got ghosted twice now)\n4. On June 18th, I got contacted for a Senior Software Engineer position from Microsoft... which I applied to back on March 13th (before the prior post)\n5. Finally, I did well in the Microsoft interviews with the team really liking me, but I got down-leveled to mid-level (as expected)\n\nSome other neat details:\n\n* For clarity, I softly began looking for \"ideal\" jobs in the second half of 2023, and then I heavily ramped up February/March 2024. So total job search time was 9mo to a year.\n* Majority of those \\~95 jobs were mid-level. Competition was stiff and I was NOT an ideal candidate on paper (as my experience is very broad and applicable but likewise it's all over the place)\n   * Feel free to message me for my LinkedIn. This account is already semi-public\n* I massively redid my resume each month. Specifics are very opinionated but there were various clear steps backwards and forwards. I regret not getting regular personal external feedback\n* For my professional network, I only contacted my former boss at Amazon for advice around late May iirc. This was also a huge energy boost\n   * This was and is a significant weakness of mine. Yes for these past two years it's been very hard to find positions even through referrals & networking, but it's still very valuable. You could say keeping in contact is a fatal flaw of mine\n* Procrastination hit me way too hard for specific helpful steps. Eg, when I would redo my resume, I would miss days or even a week of applying whatsoever\n* Finally, a huge mistake I had was not applying to startups. As advice was given to me multiple times, it was important to get my foot in the door with *any* position. And recruiters for startups were even reaching out to me directly on LinkedIn (until I removed \"Founder\" and \"Founding Engineer\" from my latest role). Yes I was very concerned over poor WLB, but I shouldn't have been ignoring potential opportunities left and right. Including from the get-go (April 29th)\n   * For clarity, I *did* apply to a few startups here and there. But too little too late.\n\nAll in all, there are a *lot* of stories I can tell. It was a very wild ride and I'm *super* fortunate to have gotten this position. Heck, it's even a sort of dream job for me with a very open-ended role working on innovation-esque work with an amazing team... all while remote at Microsoft.",

I have never switched companies while being titled a \"senior\", but I did switch through lot of company's projects and that part was somewhat ok.\n\nAnyway, I obviously have decent experience behind me and a month ago I've accepted the offer from another company. They're planning on assigning me to a project or two for the beginning, and transition me into the same type of company-level architect in the next year.\n\nWhile the position sounds extremely exciting I would be lying if I said I weren't scared of the expectations. It's been a while since I had to prove myself to someone and especially at this level. I talked a lot with this company's most experienced developers, with a CTO and CEO... they have high expectations from me so it is a bit frightening. I'm considered a senior in my current employer and people inherently trusted my decisions and thoughts on anything so I'm not sure how this will pan out switching to a new company.\n\nAre there any tips you can share on how to handle switching jobs, but as a more senior developer?

When is the right time to pitch some new ideas if I have them?\n\nI've heard a couple of tips and the main one is to talk with my direct supervisor(s) and set up goals for 3-6-12 month period, i.e. to make expectations clear from both sides.

            "This may be anecdotal but I am seeing a shift in the industry away from non-technical or highly hands off roles. In a few large companies in Australia, this was done by removing the line manager role completely and forcing people into IC roles (senior or staff, depending on tenure). About half of the managers were not able to transition and got laid off.\n\nI think this mostly has to do with the dynamics of the industry - when it\u2019s booming, everyone has a seat at the table because even a little bit of productivity helps and money is free. Now that the industry is contracting, it makes more sense to hire/keep \u201cdoers\u201d because plenty of them are also keen to manage and can be decent at it.\n\nFor your question, I wouldn\u2019t double down on what some people might refer to as bullshit or fluff roles like Agile delivery. You\u2019re already on a team with engineers writing code - learn the technical chops from them and get to a level where it\u2019s easy for you to gain technical trust and interview well on technical subjects. A sweet spot is to ask yourself whether you\u2019d be competitive with a senior engineer on your team if you were told to do IC work only.",
            "10 years of experience across FAANG and startups.\n\nIn my experience, non-technical EMs often struggle when they can\u2019t contribute to IC work or stay close to product delivery. They risk becoming process-oriented bottlenecks rather than obstacle-removing enablers.\n\nSoft skills absolutely matter\u2014they\u2019re critical\u2014but only when paired with strong technical proficiency.\n\nIf you\u2019re in this position, I\u2019d suggest doubling down on honing your technical skills to stay relevant and effective. Otherwise, a pivot to a product management role might better align with your strengths.",
            "\\> I worry about my future prospects. If I lost my job tomorrow, could I land another EM role without deeper technical expertise?\n\nGenerally, it's not a technically heavy role, so maybe?\n\n\\> How do you feel about being managed or coached by someone without dev experience?\n\nIt depends who you're asking. Seniors wouldn't like that.",
            "\\> How do you feel about being managed or coached by someone without dev experience?\n\nHonestly I hate it. People don't have to have been really good devs, but just like sports people, you won't be able to do it well without having tried being the guy on the field. Sure, there are some exceptions. But I wouldn't pick a non technical manager if it were up to me.\n\nThe main issue is that you need to know what it feels like being under pressure to deliver. What does it feel like to be asked for an estimate when you only know part of the ask? What are the technical ambiguities? If you haven't been in that situation, I don't see most people being able to manage someone who is in that position.\n\n\\> do I need to level up technically to stay competitive?\n\nThat would take years in the trenches. Not decades, but a good few years.\n\nI hate to be the bringer of bad news. I know it's hard out there, and people want to keep their jobs. There probably is somewhere out there that would take you in with your experience, but for me it's a no, and I think a lot of experienced devs would feel the same way.\n\nMan I really hate being a downer.",
            "I've worked at a company that had an executive leadership team with no engineering counterpart on it and it was a shitshow. Half the company were engineers, but no engineers were involved in any high level decision making.\n\nCurrently I'm a tech lead, so that's my role to be close to the team and worry about the more technical things. I report to a manager, and while he is a former engineer, it's been awhile and he would never even be looking at our code. He loves to be involved in engineering discussions and throw ideas out there at a high level but always defers to the team for those decisions.\n\nWhere he adds a lot of value is representing the engineering team to other departments, supporting our efforts, removing distractions and roadblocks, improving processes, helping me navigate difficult team problems, and helping us create a larger vision for how our engineering teams and infrastructure should work. He really helps the engineering team work well with the rest of the company, and is very good at servant leadership.",
            "As a Staff eng I had a less technical manager and found it really great tbh. At that level you\u2019re not looking to your manager for technical advice, mentoring and coaching. Instead it felt like we were a team looking after the department as a whole, her doing the people stuff and me the technical. Was a great working relationship.",
            "I don\u2019t think anyone who has never been a senior engineer should be an engineering manager, in any type of engineering \u2014 be it software, electrical, chemical or mechanical.\n\nI don\u2019t say that to discourage you, but encourage you to not ignore your weaknesses and blind spots. You\u2019re missing core skills that you should proactively seek to build over time, since you\u2019re being given the opportunity to learn as you go. As for your directs \u2014 they\u2019re right to be uneasy. You should find a manager who does have technical experience who you can meet with regularly to help guide you in the right direction.",
            "I had 2 technical EMs and one was very good at people management, very nice guy, worried about your mental health. They were let go.\n\nThe other was patronising, overpromised, and was not thatt much cornerned with your mental health or upward mobility, and more theirs. They were also let go.\n\nMy non techy EMs have never been let go, so do with that what you will.\n\nI don't mind discussing time/project/people management etc. but it makes no sense for an EM without tech experience to \"mentor\"  engineers about anything techy.",
            "You need a tech lead you trust and you need to learn how to ask questions. \n\nFor example, many types databases, languages, encodings etc. were all developed for certain reasons and have certain strengths. If you\u2019re in a discussion about refactoring or tech stack etc., you need to bring it up to asking about the strengths, characteristics, etc. that are connected to the outcomes you are after. You don\u2019t have to know the details tho.",
            "You had two main questions: can you find another EM jobs- too many factors there are dedicated online resources to help EM to land jobs so I won\u2019t go into that. Now your question on how do your engineers feel- accept your lack of technical depth, delegate, help IC to grow on their ladder, make few but high quality decisions, be a project manager. Your team will respect and thank you.",
            "I don\u2019t think I would care at all if they\u2019re a good manager who looks out for me",
            "EMs are not expected to excel in the technical aspects of development. Their primary responsibility is to understand developers\u2014essentially, to comprehend what they are communicating\u2014filter out low-level technical details, and focus on the parts relevant to management and other stake holders. An EM's role is fundamentally about leadership, making leadership and interpersonal skills, including political skill.\n\nI have observed cases where excellent engineers, after being promoted to EM positions, struggle to effectively manage projects. Some tend to micromanage, while others continue to function as developers, delegating management tasks to those who are bad at development. Some EMs also use authority to cloud the senior developers.",
            "Not necessarily a bad thing. \n\nI suppose a dev background helps when it comes to specific feedback on how to improve technical skills.\n\nBut most things I need feedback / help with from my manager aren\u2019t technical. Things like navigating difficult team dynamics, finding opportunities to work on my confidence etc. Somebody to reach out to when struggling (e.g things like bereavement leave).\n\nTbh, I almost dislike when 1:1s get too deep and technical about the things I\u2019m working on. It should be about *me*. \n\nMore important to be good with people than to be good with code. And tbh it does sound like a bit of imposter syndrome - your background certainly sounds technical and relevant enough to me either way",
            "Just don't try to be anything you're not. Empower them to do what they're already excellent at, delegating and following up where it's necessary.\n\nAt the same time, do your best to \"protect\" your team from outside factors and advocate for them, preferably in a transparent and visible way to them.\n\nA slightly Machiavellian strategy might be to intentionally hire people who are technically savvy but hate the social/managerial aspects of leading. You know, the \"just let me code in peace\". That way your role as a glue and a referee of the team will be cemented.",
            "Avoid em",
            "Sure, it will help, if you have all the answers, but there's a chance that that will lead to superhero syndrome, and you'll lose your one precious commodity (time), because now everyone relies on you.\n\nI find it more valuable to know each of the subject matter experts, and then delegate, accordingly, so you can spend more time on handling people issues and investing in your team.\n\nYou can't scale yourself, but you can grow the people around you to support both you and each other.",
            "Thanks for all the replies. Too many to reply to all, but there's a really interesting range of opinions, from positive to negative. The fact there is such a diverse range of views gives me some hope that I still may still be able to get by!",
            "**The more experience the people you\u2019re managing, the less it matters.**\n\nThat\u2019s because the more experience you get, the more experienced you are with talking to non-technical folks. So talking to a not-so-technical EM has very little bearing\n\nThat being said, if you\u2019d be managing less experienced people, you really need to be technical. \n\nSo what should you do if you\u2019re a not-so-technical EM? - same. Ensure projects are on time, operations are efficient and that you are actively growing your people. \n\nThat last part is where not-so-technical EMs shine - growing people. That\u2019s because a very technical EM tend to do the work. And everytime you do the work, you rob somebody else the opportunity to grow.",
            "Honestly I've had some great non-technical managers.  Your job is not to lead development -- get a team of competent engineers to do that.  Instead you act as a fecal shield, protecting your team from having to deal with the inane bullshit of working in a corporate environment.  If you can pull that off, your subordinates won't care about your leetcode skills.",

            "If you go this way you\u2019re going to have to get lethally good at everything else.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDevelop such expertise in, for instance, project estimation, that it\u2019s almost a technical skill all on its own. Or have such fantastic relationships across the company and outside of it, and actively maintain them, so you are able to make things happen when others can\u2019t.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe biggest challenge I see for the nontechnical EM is that they can\u2019t identify technology bullshitters. Sooner or later you need to back a risky initiative and you can\u2019t always rely solely on advice",
            "I\u2019ve had technical EMs and nontechnical ones. \n\nThe technical ones were uniformly good.\n\nThe nontechnical ones ranged from harmless (not great but got out of the way and didn\u2019t cause problems) to disastrous. The worst person I ever worked with in my career was a nontechnical EM. I would never accept one if I could avoid it.",
            "I've been talking a lot with a new hire EM but who started as a SE. We've been talking about one of their reports because I was the TL for them. We talked about growth, opportunities, feedback, expectations, coaching, and a whole bunch of other stuff. I don't think I would be able to have that conversation with you. I think it would turn into a me teaching you session, for pretty much every session.\n\nI have had a non-technical manager before and it was fine. The non-technical manager leaned heavily on the tech lead for anything that went beyond surface level knowledge. It worked but only because the tech lead took on many of the manager's responsibilities. Again, having a non-technical manager was fine, but I'm not sure if I would consider that to be fair to a TL, taking on the manager's responsibilities because of the manager's lack of ability.",
            "I currently am and its fine",
            "I could not care less. I mean it can be nice to have a technical em to like run stuff by them. But I\u2019ve been significantly more technical than any em I\u2019ve worked for in the last 5 years. If I wanted someone one more technical than me I\u2019d hire another staff engineer. \n\nAs long as they aren\u2019t actually pretending to be technical\u2026 that\u2019s a nightmare. \n\nI currently report to the cto at my company who is not at all technical at this point. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s written code in 7 years. But I\u2019ve offered to report to a manager who is more technical than him but less than I am who is 2 levels below me. \n\nI\u2019ve actually also offered to report to our mid level engineer as a joke. But if someone wanted that what do I care.",
            "I can't really say, other than to share what I've noticed, and that's that the lowest level of managers is being cut, substantially more management/product work is falling on tech leads, and the managers that do exist are spread between several teams.\n\nIf you are going to be lean, this is probably the approach you'd want to maximize delivery for a given budget, but that does require tradeoffs.\n\nFor you, as an manager, if you think you can hang with every technical discussion and make sure any decision does right by the product and future development plans (that's 90% of being a tech lead anyway), you only need junior/mid level software skills for the occasional PRs you write.\n\nEspecially with AI, coding has never been easier, and as long as you know what do, you can write any feature in any language much more quickly than ever before. LLMs aren't a panacea against not knowing where you want to be in a given tradeoff space, but they make getting there like 10x more efficient when you're operating in a new language/framework/project.",
            "An Engineering Manager should be an enabler helping their team produce results and should be concerned with business priorities, career development, and getting the team resources they need.\n\nIf you have  known weaknesses and gaps - or even time - you should lean on your most technical reports and trust their technical judgement as long as it meets the business objectives.",
            "Detest them.\n\nI welcome the downvotes for being too harsh but sometimes the imposter syndrome is justified - how can you be effective at managing something you have no understanding of?\n\nHow would you feel spending decades of your life honing hard skills to then get forced/unsolicited coaching/advice from someone who has no idea what they're talking about? It's incredibly transparent, and immediately makes me lose respect.\n\nThat said, the industry is full of non technical people pretending to be technical managers so, you'll probably be able to find something."

        "content": "For me it was probably the years 2013-16. Those were big transformative years for the web in the sense that many companies started updating their requirements for web devs in a big way.\n\nI started my developer journey with PHP 4.x back in 2006 I think. I spent 2 years learning PHP and MySQL. I was always on Sitepoint,  Tuts+, and Lynda.com.  Got my first job doing back-end dev sometime in 2007. I later transitioned to PHP 5 and CodeIgniter taught me OOP and MVC. Then I joined a startup in 2013 and put the brakes on learning, as I was good with what I knew for the job I had.\n\nUnbeknownst to me, that was essentially the same as hiding under a rock. Or going into a cryo-sleep while the world was drastically changing around me. For the web, that is what it felt like. \n\nNode and Composer hit the scene around the same time and all of a sudden Vagrant was a thing. Infrastructure as code (Ansible, Chef, Puppet) all exploded onto the scene. Front end had Backbone.js, knockout and Angular. Laravel was becoming popular then also. \n\nI was laid off from my startup job in early 2015 and went off job hunting, and didn't yet \"wake up\" from my cryo-sleep. But as months went by I realized something was very wrong. I applied to lots of places, had a couple of interviews, but no offers. This was the first time I felt destroyed by the industry.\n\nThat's when I started probing further on web dev articles and realize when I was in deep slumber while the web world went through a transformation and I missed out. Didn't realize it then but the pure back-end web developer was becoming a thing of the past. I chose an unlucky time to put the brakes on learning. By 2016, it would be super intense to get into the thick of it while it was still changing at a rapid pace. After things slowed down again I had tried everything and because I needed to pick some new \"mains\". Laravel for PHP, Knockout.js for frontend, Vagrant for local dev env, but old faithful Apache for server management. (don't know how to replace Apache with Ansible yet).",

Like you I didn't want to give it up, but realistically I had to.  \n\nI had been looking for a new role for about a year myself.  While my job at my last company was safe (for the moment) I saw the writing on the wall and knew I had to start making an exit plan.  It seems like more places these days will let you work from home occasionally than in the past.  But I couldn't find very many that were 100% remote.  Those, I found tended to pay significantly lower than I would have otherwise expected or were for obviously crappy companies.  \n\nI bit the bullet and decided to look at regular on site jobs.  All and all, the place I landed at is pretty sweet.  It's only 10 minutes from the house and I go the opposite of rush hour traffic flow to get there.  The dress code is basically non existent.  I can come and go as I please as long as I work 8ish hours per day.  The boss and team members are good guys.  Free snacks,soda and beer in the fridge.  Work often buys lunch 2-3 days per week.  etc etc.  On top of that the benefits are great overall and the pay is about 30% more than I was making at my last job.\n\nI can even work from home.  Not every day, or even regularly.  But it's still very nice to be able to work from home when I'm sick, have car trouble, need to have someone look at my HVAC, etc etc.  \n\nI really couldn't have landed in a better spot to be honest.  Even then, it's just hard to adjust.  The hardest adjustment to me is that I no longer spend 40 hours per week basically alone.  I didn't realize how much I enjoyed that until it was gone.  Used to be, after work I was totally fine with and ready to hang out with friends or do something else after work.\n\nNow, after being surrounded by people all day.  I really just wanted to be home and be alone.  It's even been kind of hard on my wife because she used to enjoy how much more outgoing I was after work than I am now.  \n\nI also really miss my comfortable computer chair.  There isn't a comfortable computer chair in this building.\n\nAll that said, it gets better and better every day.  I'm still in the process of getting used to it 8 months later myself.

Think about the cross functional relationships you've had at your previous company, and how valuable they were to get things done. I specifically always made time to get to know platform engineering / infrastructure, they got a lot of sway and know how things are done.\n\nThe reality is managers are usually bad at onboarding / planning these things, and its the responsibility of the new hire to make it happen. If I were you, i'd identify a person per day to grab a coffee or virtual coffee with, and do it. Or better yet, ask your manager for 2 - 3 intros, and then when you meet with them, ask them who you should meet with, and it will grow.\n\nYou don't need to talk shop or engineering, just get to know them. Relationships are super important in any org. Literally just ask simple questions: \"Whats your story? Whats your favorite thing about working here? What do you wish you knew from the start? Anything you would recommend me to be doing?\"\n\nOnce you've met a bunch of people, then you can identify who is the most valuable to deepen your relationships with.\n\nAlso the other thing is even if you are senior, just say out loud you're gonna ask a lot of questions and they may sound like stupid questions, but the more you are unburdened by the fear of asking questions, the quicker you learn.\n\nJust my 2 cents.

            "Knowing the latest tech vs outdated tech doesn't make you a Senior dev vs a Junior dev. You're not going to go back to needing someone to cut your tasks up into 1-2 day slices and check in on you two times a day, learn how to work in a professional setting, learn how to read other people's code, etc. There's more to being Senior then the tech stack you're familiar with.\n\nThat being said, you're right that being on an older stack still will make you less marketable, so you either need to find a company that is still living in that long tail of older tech or start catching up on something newer.\n\nPersonally, I would advise you to start working on projects with React. Don't try to learn several new FE frameworks at the same time, one will be enough of a jump and React is the most popular one in the market right now, to maximize your chances. One idea would be to find a couple basic 1-2 projects that have design elements included to get started learning the basics (use create react app, next, or similar to get started, don't bother hand-rolling webpack/vite/whatever). Then pick something a bit more complex that includes some data manipulation and more dynamic content. I'd also suggest using git aas you go, maybe even breaking the work up into some small tasks and making sure you're committing for each (will help you practice git, but also help you plan and see progress as you're working on things).\n\nThe key elements you want to learn are:\n* Using React: note: you want newer React, so hooks not class components. \n* Newer CSS: a lot more is available now, experiment with newer CSS or with a newer library (I personally think getting comfortable with raw CSS is more valuable than the latest library, but make sure it's new and not just more bootstrap)\n* Newer JS: JS has continued to move forward, it would be worth skimming some posts on additions to the language\n\nI considered adding TypeScript, but I think it's more important to try and get several tiny and small projects under your belt with those 3 above first.\n\n[Frontend Mentors free projects](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges?types=free) is one place to find some projects.

Within a couple of sprints, she was able to start doing the bulk of the work on the project, allowing me to start on another one. \n\nSo far as job opportunities go, target companies that are revamping legacy web apps.

They have been at this place 10 years or more, and just get by on the fact that they know the system so well, keep getting paid well enough to stick around... but as I'm discovering, as we modernise our codebase, basic shit like ES6 is a mystery to them.\n\nIf you wanna keep goldbricking, learning most of this new shit shouldn't take you that long. You can cover the basics of Git in an afternoon. `git pull`, `git push`, `git checkout -b feature/feature-branch-name` is about all you need to know to get started. Any decent company will have locks on the vital branches like master and develop so you can't fuck them up.\n\nAs for frameworks, something like React (or Vue; I use Vue) might be more of a stretch, but if you've been coding for this long I don't see why you can't learn it. All it does is basically tidy up all those event listeners and shit for you, packaging everything away in components. Instead of writing a click handler for an element, you write `@click=\"doThis()\"` on an element on <div> tag, like `<div @click=\"doThis()\">` and then `doThis()` is the method that does whatever. These kind of frameworks have their own syntax and structure to learn, but... it's just syntax and structure. The fundamentals of what it's all trying to do should be fairly obvious.\n\nnpm is no mystery either. It's a package manager. Instead of importing modules at the top of every file, or in some master index.js file called by every other file, you have a .json file that lists the modules you want, and then you run `npm install` and they're installed. That's it.\n\nI think you've overcomplicating how much you really need to learn. You can probably learn a few things, blag the rest, and learn on the job. As a junior Dev, I didn't know Vue, knew a bit of React from a tutorial I did, blagged my way onto my first proper job as a front-end dev, and learned Vue on the go.

Trying to get back in and I'm lost as I'm no longer a \"best pick\" candidate for *any* role anymore. Wondering what others have done in this situation\n\n===\n\nHi all, I'm a software engineer with \\~7 YOE who left a FAANG (Amazon) job in 2022 so I could try building my own \"business\"... in a completely different industry (game development). The decision was originally made so I could both focus on my mental health (uncovered ADHD) as well as see what would happen if I focused on something of my own for a long period of time. I had been saving for quite a while so I thought I'd be perfectly fine with the worst case scenario of waiting out the upcoming \"recession\" in 2023.\n\nNow I'm looking to get back into the tech industry (full stack or backend services mainly) and I do technically meet the requirements for *many* roles. But with the immense competition in the current market, I don't stand out as the \"best pick\" on paper no matter what (in my opinion).\n\nThus I'd like to ask: **Have you gone through a similar experience before? How did you navigate back into your former career OR how did you pivot to a new career?**\n\nAs bonus details:\n\n* It's not monetarily viable for me to wait out the market until, say, next year\n* In addition, I've made neat advancements in the game dev space but there aren't many relevant doors in that direction (yet) and I'd like to focus this post on the main career topic\n* Furthermore, perhaps I just need a reminder that I should reach out to my former network (even if I haven't spoken to them in years whatsoever) and/or keep massively cold applying the entire time\n* Finally, I may just be overthinking things. Earlier in the month I went pretty far with a specific company that I was really into, but the \"no\" was pretty devastating for me. Since then I haven't found a role that was a solid overlap of interests and role fit",

I treated my year in this game dev path, as a Software Engineer position, and created good and true bullet points out of this year working on the game, everything I learned, all the challenges, and so on. \n\nI was leading the engineering of a game, I had to implement design patterns, take architecture decisions, handle the priority of the tasks and really manage the project. I had to manage the building of this game in multiple platforms with a CI/CD pipeline and release it to Steam.\n\nAfter I wrote down all of this, I also created a page of my game development company on LinkedIn, and put that I was working in as a self employed software engineer (no, not as a founder or CTO, as I wanted a software engineer position) in this company.\n\nThen on the interviews actually this helped me sometimes, as all the managers that interviewed me were very curious about what I did, the challenges and how I solved then.\n\nOf course, it's very different when you already have 10+ years, because you can show you know what you're talking about, and you have other experiences in the CV to support it.\n\nBut dealing with it as a normal software engineer position helped me a lot.",

            "I personally haven\u2019t done this but know quite a few colleagues who have. They usually fall in two major categories\n\n1. The colleague wants to start their own business which is very similar to what their current employer does (not same because why would you solve a problem where the solution already exists but could be a niche, for example the current employer offers their solution only to enterprises but nothing exists for small to medium business). Anyway, all the colleague can do is think and noodle over it because any work done on their venture could directly violate their agreement with the current employer. In that case, they make a plan, make a few phone calls and then quit their job cold turkey. The reason is that they don\u2019t need to study the industry, they\u2019ve already worked on it. They know about the problems, current solutions and the gaps. \n\n2. The colleague wants to start something totally different from what their current employer does. In this case, they start their venture in parallel to their current job ( work on it on evenings, weekends etc). This allows them to study the market, test out the waters and figure out if the business has enough promise to quit their stable job and focus on it full time. \n\nMy advice would be that if your startup is in a different space from your current industry, then don\u2019t quit your job. Work on it as a side hustle. In that case, it\u2019s not a major transition for you. The moment you feel like you just aren\u2019t able to keep up and working on your startup full time is going to be worth it, quit your job. \n\nAnother advice I can give is try to find a like minded cofounder who have offer skills that you don\u2019t have, if you\u2019re in tech then the co founder could be a business person. This will help you keep each other motivated and help you move faster.",

Ignore the nay sayers who appear to believe the only startups that matter are angel funded product companies. That's just one kind of business. And it's not even the majority of them.\n\nIf you do go consulting/contracting, it's all relationships. So start figuring out your linked in now. Who in your network understands what you do, trusts you, and needs (either now or in the future) your expertise? Start market sizing that.\n\nOne thing I wish I had done is add marketing to the list of outsourcing. So, again, if you can budget for that to not be your problem I would.

For example, nothing stops you from opening a company on another person's name and hire yourself as a generic consultant and run the show behind the scenes.\n\nSo just start building projects for clients as a contractor, let them spend all that money on trial and error and if they achieve success, time to open your own shop.",

            "My second-hand experience is that being a co-founder long term means you're committing to years of wearing every single engineering hat. Then you can stay as an actual CxO and become a manager/executive who doesn't touch code but helps run the company. Or you're basically side-lined with no reports and nothing you do will be of any importance anymore since you're too awkward organizationally for the new management to want to deal with. Depending on how much stock you have you can also try partially/mostly exiting during a round of funding but then you have the risk of whomever is left f-ing you over on the remaining equity.\n\nWhich brings me to the actual question: What do you actually enjoy doing day to day?",
            "I have started my own company before, worked at two FAANG companies, and worked for other people's startups twice.\n\nDo **not** start a company just to start a company. Especially if you don't have a cofounder lined up.  Tons of work and stress with miniscule chances of renumeration. You will have to learn many new skills (around administering a company, raising capital, marketing, product design) - which is all achievable with the right partner, the right motivations, etc.  But you won't have those things if you're just doing a startup for a startup's sake and also trying to figure out a worthwhile idea at the same time.\n\nI have seen many people do a startup-for-startup's stake. I have done it myself once. It is a good way to spin your wheels, end up with no pay to show for it, and maybe even be isolated and depressed from working completely alone every day.and it amounting to zilch.\n\nI suggest working for a small startup, for a limited amount of time (18-24 months).   You will find that on paper, this makes no financial sense compared to staying at FAANG - you will be making maybe 25-50% your TCO at FAANG, in exchange for options that will 90% go to zero, and even in the upside case - probably only enough shares to make back what you would have gotten staying at FAANG. But that's not the point, you will get exposed to more of the business side and meet other people interested in startups that you might start a company with.\n\nYou should pick a company that's <10 people and ideally (I know this is annoying) working in an office instead of WFH so you can end up working with folks outside of engineering.\n\nThe second best option is: keep your job at FAANG, be disciplined about logging off at 5 every day, and afterwords, work on your startup idea.  Focus on just learning about areas that interest you (the business side, not just the tech side). Build products and - this is key- try to get users for those products by putting them in front of people, getting feedback, asking people to pay.\n\nDo some small amount of \"networking\", but don't fill up your time going to startup events with other people hooked on the idea of a startup but no concrete thing they are doing. Instead, create your product first, and be showing it off to other people until you find someone you click with.\n\nBe very very careful about your employer not owning your IP here; don't you dare ever use your work machine or anything else owned by your employer for your project, and don't compete with your employer's products. If your employer is a FAANG company, the areas they compete in are so very broad, this might constrain you significantly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEither one of these two paths will give you the chance to learn about startups, find someone to work with, and figure out what business you're really passionate about building.  You will have a direction to work in, instead of just wandering. And you'll have someone to work with and bounce ideas off of, instead of completely isolating yourself.  And you won't be starting the clock on drawing down your savings in the meantime. Once the idea and team is set, then you will be ready to start a company - and you'll be much better positioned to raise outside capital for your company.\n\nSome useful resources:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFour Steps to the Epiphany by Steve Blank - on customer discovery\n\nDesign for Hackers by David Kadavy - on learning design, since you'll have to own that aspect of what you do now too.\n\nYC Startup School: [https://www.startupschool.org/](https://www.startupschool.org/)",

Starting with \"own startup\" is setting yourself up for a difficult time. You should also consider **why** you want to own a startup, since you might find that you don't really enjoy it or are not very good at it.\n\nOwning a startup involves much more than just SWE. Being a high performing dev in a medium/large business and owning a startup are two very different skill areas. Similarly, a lot of startup owners might not actually make the cut in a FAANG environment to begin with. You would do well to remind yourself that most startup owners could not do what you currently do and are not startup owners by choice, and also that the overwhelming majority of startups fail.\n\nInstead, a better way to go about it is to get into an early stage startup with someone with some solid business acumen and who can handle things outside of dev, with the aim of being the CTO side of things.\n\nYou should also consider that given your most recent experience is in medium/large enterprises, that you are going to be in a very different tech environment at a startup.",

You won't make any money, in fact, you will be losing money. At least, the first few years. But if you can figure out a business model, that is your first stride towards financial independence. Some people choose to raise money during this phase bec they can't afford losing money during the R&D phase. But my suggestion is to not raise money if you can afford it.\n\nEven if you make $15K/year with your gig, you have it made, because you can essentially scale your business when you are ready to move at a faster pace. And the best part is, you are not beholden to ANYONE. You don't have to live in Silicon Valley, you can live where YOU want.\n\nI will warn you though that even making $15K will be insanely difficult that first year or two. If you aren't business minded, start looking for a biz cofounder now. Don't scoff at the idea of a non tech founder either. The business side of things is what will bring in the money. Tech can always be outsourced, but at a high cost. However, contrary to belief, you save a ton of money by keeping things inhouse. The reason why people think outsourcing is cheap, is due to leaders not understanding that less is more. 2 highly paid well vetted \"inhouse\" engineers cost less than a team of 15 outsourced engineers. And the 2 highly paid engineers will output much better code at a faster rate. You just need a good tech leader. That tech leader can be you.",

How much time did it take you to get over the unreal learning curve (C++ was one of the first languages I learned)? Was it hard to get a Job?

            "Knowing C++ is not the issue. Gamedev is an incredibly technical field with very niche topics you have to be familiar with. For example, I don't know anyone outside of game devs that work with octrees and GPU programming. There's a lot of different things you can work on as a programmer from gameplay, tools, graphics, networking, etc. \nThe competition for entry level is extremely stiff. You'll more or less be restarting your career and competing with new grads that have been pursuing it intensely for half a decade. I can only speak from what I've seen as a hobbyist game dev for the last 8 years.\nTry to make a game in unreal first. Something small.",
            "Game development chews through fresh grads who are prepared to work all the hours for no money just because they like games. Then most of them grow up and get more sustainable jobs. A few stick around and become seniors who still get paid peanuts.\n\nSince you're fresh to the industry, you won't be a senior due to the niche skills, so basically everything will be bad. Unless you're prepared for that, probably better to accept that you missed the boat here.",

All I/O must be non-blocking.\n\nI emphasize this because it's the #1 difference I see from game industry and non-game industry developers.  Non-game-industry folks throw out long blocking calls like it's nothing.\n\nEdit:  To be clear, I transitioned the other way, from games to tech (and back, and now kind of in the middle)",

            "[deleted]",
            "I transitioned from gamedev to full stack engineer.\n\nMy reasoning (after 6 years in the game industry):\n- A decent game typically took 2 years or more to complete. Like even the MVP alone would take 6-8 months to materialise from concept to showcase-able state.\n- The work feels like never ending, due to the long dev time. A feature is never really done. Once you add a new feature, it'll surely affects the rest of the game system.\n- The pay was not that great. I mean, I don't blame them, a game took forever to make anyway. By the time it came out, if you're lucky, it became a hit, the company make money, you get raise and bonus; unfortunately, most of the time it doesn't become a hit and it may take forever for the company to recoup the dev budget.\n- Work life balance (if you're into those things) are non existent. With all the features and bug fixes you have to work on, you just can't catch a break. But if you're the type that loves a good challenge every day, gamedev can totally give you that.\n- Finding a job is excruciatingly hard. Because of how complicated a gamedev is -- takes forever, low profitability, gets harder to make the more ambitious the game designer is -- most companies prefer to hire seniors and often don't offer to train newbies.\n\nSince transitioned to a full stack engineer 7 years ago, I have never been happier writing codes for a living. The challenge may not be as high or fun as a gamedev, at least I can get better pay and achieve better work life balance.\n\nEdit: Change spelling and add years since transitioned.",
            "It can be a cool career move if you\u2019re excited by the technical challenges unique to game development.\n\nKeep in mind though:\n\n- You will have no creative control. Even if you think the game is terrible shovelware, you will likely have approximately zero input into improving the game outside of technical issues.\n- Game development timelines can be *long*. You might get hired to work on a AAA game today that won\u2019t be released until 2030. Understand the implications of this and the impact on your motivation.",
            "I did frontend and backend work for both game and non game development. Game dev for many years on different companies doing different things. The thing that strikes me the most about game dev is how little engineering is regarded in the field. You're a puppet for product managers and artists to do their bidding, as fast as possible and as cheaply as possible. No one cares about good engineering, it's not what gets the money.\n\nDid that for many years and moved to more stable technical industries. Never looked back.",
            "I did. I went to school for it but did Software Dev for years... then finally was offered a role at an award winning studio this year. I love it... great culture, great pay. Makes me so much happier.",
            "I do gamedev as a hobby.\n\nThe problem with gamedev is that it's a very crowded market with high market competition. The wages are not very good because there is a large labor pool driven by passionate individuals.\n\nEvery week roughly 200 apps are released on steam! In fact the distribution of successful games is quite skewed. It's actually similar to YouTube or Spotify where a disproportionate amount of attention goes to the top games. The truly top games have budgets in the hundreds of millions, have more mocap and voice acting than full seasons of television shows, and have legions of artists, many outsourced.\n\nIn contrast, areas like cloud computing, web services, and crud apps are an order of magnitude easier to build and in high demand since virtually all businesses need support in these areas. The labor market is also intensely skewed by the tech monopolies which all will take a 30% cut of whatever you create.\n \nIn the next 5 years, I believe advances in AI will touch even more industries, and in the next 10 years it's possible that gamedev skills become more relevant if the Internet becomes more AR/XR oriented. Until then, gamedev as a job is not great",
            "As I get older, I'm starting to feel this is my only life and that I should try, even if it's a pay cut",
            "I'm surprised nobody's mentioned this yet: consider industries that are adjacent to games, ones that use some of the same skills but don't have the significant compensation and work/life balance issues that game development tends to have. Examples include simulations, educational games, visualization, A/V systems, gaming (as in casino games), entertainment, events & special effects, remote collaboration software, immersive media, theme park equipment, aircraft instrumentation, medical visualization... there's plenty of niches that use some or all of the same skills and technologies that you'd use for game development. \n\nSome example jobs from a cursory LinkedIn search:\n\n- [Software Developer, 3D Render Engine Development](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3712731212/) at Daktronics, who make those huge video displays for stadiums and performance venues\n- [Interactive Simulation Designer/Developer, K-12 Science and Math Education](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3650162364/) at ExploreLearning\n- [Software Engineer, FigJam](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3536508032/) at Figma, building remote collaboration tools\n- [Scientific Software Engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3663863855/) at ERT Inc, working on modeling space weather and RF processing\n- [Engine Software Engineer, Generalist](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3641792240/) at KittyCAD, developing tooling for hardware designers\n\nDon't underestimate your current skills, either. You can absolutely build a high-quality real-time 3D game for the browser using JS/TS + WebGL or soon WebGPU, optionally augmented with some WASM here and there. I previously worked in browser-based educational software. We weren't that high-performance (we used the HTML5 Canvas interface rather than WebGL, for example) but there was still *way* more low-level code being written than at a typical JS job.\n\nIt's not JavaScript's fault that most programs written in JS don't prioritize performance (often correctly). You just have to write it a bit differently, with a mindset a bit closer to writing in a lower-level language like C++.",
            "I went the opposite way and it wasn't terribly hard to leave. AAA left a bad taste in my mouth and I don't think I'll ever go back to game dev because of the dismal(comparatively) pay, long hours, and management breathing down your neck to hit milestones. I'd be hesitant to leave web for games, if you want to work on highly performant stuff there's embedded or similar, if you do transition I hope you enjoy it more than I did.",
            "Significantly different and the math/low level programming matters. C++ is a different beast in itself and its not as transferable coming from those languages compared to C, Rust, or similar.\n\nIt\u2019s all possible but your background and experience will make a huge difference. You can definitely do it but more than anything I\u2019d note the reason I steered away was not my skill set but the industry, how it functions, and extreme competition.\n\nNetworking, game physics, and lighting in particular are notoriously difficult areas to learn with the level at which they are building in higher tier companies. There are engines like Unity and Unreal but they don\u2019t negate writing complex logic within them even though the abstractions/APIs can be very useful.\n\nSuggestion - take a few online game dev and low level programming classes to get a feel for it. There will be a ton of foreign concepts to you more than likely.",

You can still be an engine programmer at an indie game studio, it's not only for AAA studios. You get all the benefits of having really fun coworkers and seeing your work in the game, etc. Anything obnoxiously complicated like physics and graphics is where it's at :) There's a huge demand for people who can modify and enhance Unreal engine specifically.",
            "I honestly can't think of anything worse. The industry is famous for brutal crunch cycles and low pay. And if by some miracle you actually get the game out on time you'll probably be laid off or spend the next 6 months being screamed at by capital G Gamers about \"netcode\" and \"optmisation\". And you better hope there is nothing \"woke\" in the game, or you're in deep shit.\n\nIt sounds miserable.",

            "So, it kind of depends on what you mean by \"game development.\" I'm assuming you mean mean becoming a gameplay programmer based on wanting to use C++ with UE. My experience in trying this for a few years is that knowing C++ well isn't enough to get your foot in the door. Most places won't touch you unless your resume has professional gamedev experience, or at least some hobbyist experience with published games. \n\nWhen I actually did get interviews, they were either pretty ridiculous and intense compared to what I'm used to, or I managed to get through the process and was offered a really low salary compared to doing web stuff. I'm sure some people would be fine taking a salary cut to work on games and to escape web, but to me it felt like a huge step backwards, especially for jobs that are super volatile due to the release cycle of games. I would just stick to being a hobbyist myself, but I'm sure there are experienced people who do end up transitioning and it works out for them.",
            "I'm in a similar mindset at the moment. I've always loved to of got into the gaming industry but now I've made my way up to management now. But I'm still going to try, regardless, mostly part time indie development but if you really want it, go for it. Just don't cut off your current income too soon",
            "I would suggest you research the area well before transitioning, or even before starting learning whatever you feel you need to be able to transition.\n\nI've heard that game development is not that good of an environment. Look it up, try to talk to people in companies you are aiming for, go on Glassdoor, etc.",
            "This was always what I wanted to do, but honestly it's easier and pays better to do regular software engineering",
            "I've been learning unreal engine for 3 months approx. I would suggest use library Genesis, look up \"blueprints visual scripting for unreal engine 5\". Go through the book chapter by chapter. It is amazing as a tool and you'll feel so accomplished once you understand it.\n\n\nFor game dev tho, there are so many avenues to pursue. Like you can get a job, just doing materials, or animations, or story line, game idea. You can get crowd funding. I've seen one surprising game get 1 million in funding lol. I think game dev is an extremely versatile and growing avenue. \n\n\nYou just have to stray away from all these boring game modes, with single challenges. \"kill monster, level up, repeat\". Or \"pass level, upgrade, repeat forever\" . I really think there is more that could be done with games. To enhance the game play.\n\nOne tactic I've learned is \"not just one problem\". Any player interaction, fight, battle should have an additional problem going on besides just the monster they're fighting. Like growing shadows on the field that do damage to the player, or floating orbs that can connect with the monster and grant power ups to the monster, etc.\n\nOne series on YouTube I really enjoy is \"worst mmos ever\" by John Hayes strife. It's a really awesome way to see how different games were made. View old games and see unique gameplay aspects, or ideas. I think the most beneficial thing to making games is to see as many games as possible."

        "content": "Background:  20 years as a coder.  15 years at my 1st company, 5 years at my 2nd.\n\n\n\n1st company:  QA team is great.  Their job is primarily manual testing.  They knew the product inside and out.  They knew the company\u2019s domain knowledge better than the devs.  They catch things the devs never considered and are a tremendous asset to this company. Over the years they adopted automated testing.  I thought it was a useful but costly process to create and maintain automated tests.\n\n2nd company: Quarter of the revenue and employee size as 1st company.  QA is insistent on writing automated tests.  They\u2019re made up of people who have made it no secret that they want to transition into full-time coders.  The QA team misses things (of course, so did us coders, definitely not putting the blame on them).  They do not catch as many bugs as 1st company\u2019s QA team.  They do not take on learning company\u2019s domain knowledge. They\u2019re not as good as the QA team from my 1st company, which is frustrating.\n\n\n\n\nAn example of what we went through recently is a new QA hire named, let\u2019s say, Percy.  All Percy wanted to do is code and not do manual tests.  Percy wasn\u2019t good at either.  Percy kept bugging the dev team with programming questions.  Our Product Owner was fed up with Percy\u2019s performance that the PO even did manual testing since PO couldn\u2019t even trust Percy. Our Engineering Manager finally told Percy to focus more on manual testing and devote 10% of their time to writing automated tests.  Percy quit.\n\n\n\n\nMy question for this sub is:  are we hiring the wrong people or is my opinion of a company\u2019s QA department wrong/outdated?  1st company QA hires came from more of a tech support background.  2nd company QA hires come from more of a background in CS.  Our CTO has a big interest in automated testing, but I think it\u2019s a Sunk Cost Fallacy.  The automated tests are awesome when they catch things, but it\u2019s rare and IMHO not worth the cost so I do not share our CTO\u2019s opinion of them.\n\n=====================\n\nEDIT:  Thank you so much for all of the comments.  Definitely walking away from this post with a different, better understanding of things.  Some more context and conclusions:\n\n* Everyone's assumption that QA is junior is 100% correct, including the QA lead.\n* Devs write unit and integration tests.  QA write automated tests in the form of E2E and Selenium tests.\n* Automated tests are important.  So is doing new, exploratory manual testing, which is what I'm not seeing from QA, so the devs need to do more of that work.\n* Never thought about manual and automated testing as 2 separate jobs.  That makes so much sense!\n* I think my conclusion that automated tests are a Sunk Cost Fallacy **at this current company** is because we're a very small company.  We just don't have the budget to fund proper automated testing.\n* I need to not use QA as a crutch and think about how to improve the quality of my output.  I was spoiled at my 1st company.",

            "Industry trends have been to cut costs. This includes spending on QA and on training and on loyalty. As you noted, everyone in QA wants to be on the engineering team. Why is that? My guess is at your new and smaller company that engineering gets paid more and has better job security than QA. As far as I know there aren't QA boot camps or degrees aimed at QA.",
            "I think the challenge is the scope of work. I have automation engineers whose goals are getting us to cd. The role is not to be the only ones catching issues. Their job is to help automate validation that changes don\u2019t break finished features. I expect the developer, the developer reviewer, the ui/ux reviewer, the qa, the qa reviewer, and the po to each validate that the code does what it is supposed to. Qa is there as part of our cd process, not to be the catch everything so developers can sling shit code and see what sticks. They are great but your process and ownership of whom should be testing is off in my opinion.\n\nWe run 5 devs to 3 qa engineers. I find its harder to find automation engineers than devs. As for people like percy, just try to find people interested in helping reach the cd part of ci/cd. Qa may do regression tests if you arent at cd but that should be the goal.",
            "sounds like percy specifically didnt actually want to do QA.\n\nthis is definitley a hiring problem. they should hire people who actually want to do the job, not some other job.\n\nQA is actually a very important role. my company pays our QA people quite well specifically so that they dont feel bad about being QA.\n\nto be fair, if QA paid like crap I too would try very hard to transition out of QA.",
            "My perspective as a QA dude who probably does 80/20 automation/manual:\n\nThe automation isn't to catch bugs. It's to catch regressions. Not everything must be automated. Some things don't make sense to automate, but - so long as there's feature development on the product - the regression suite should be growing with it. \n\nI don't automate anything that I haven't manually tested first. They're part of the same process. How can I tell the automation what to expect if I don't know what to expect? While I do some exploratory testing, a lot of it just a consequence of being a curious person and prodding the product manager to be very clear about the behavior they want in the acceptance criteria. \n\nSide-note: I kind of hate the \"QA breaks the app\" trope. We don't break it. We just figure out what was already broken as often as we can and then bring it up. While I've got opinions, if the PM says \"it's a feature, not a bug\" and is willing it put it in writing so I can cover my ass, then it may not get kicked back to your TODO list.",
            "A lot of people, including developers, have a skewed and often inaccurate view of testing and automated testing.\n\nFor example, automated testing is not the same as testing. Automated testing is not likely to catch bugs. That's not really its job. It's job is to provide a safety net, a canary in the coalmine, and to provide confidence.\n\nTesting also isn't really about catching defects, though it does that quite well. Testing is about articulating the state of the product/project so that someone can make informed business decisions. Testing is about pulling all the various testing activities together and articulating the risk to the product/project/business. Testing is about identifying risk.\n\nRisk is highly contextual. So the approach to testing should be highly contextual.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpeaking generally, on most projects I would want to see a multi-pronged approach:\n\n* Developer testing at the unit level. Ideally augmented by mutation testing.\n* Code reviews or pair/mob programming.\n* Some manual \"checking\", done either by developers or QA personnel.\n* More exploratory testing.\n* Automated tests focusing on integration points, in sane amounts.\n* End to end automation of fundamental workflows, also in sane amounts.\n* Automated performance & load testing as necessary.\n* Security testing as necessary.\n* And then, to actually put the QA in QA, some sort of feedback loop to identify weaknesses and cover them.\n\nAnd, as stated, tune all of this to the product and business.\n\nNow, as to your examples, for sure automated testing now represents a back door into a developers role and you are going to encounter people who are using it as such. I think that comes with the territory.",
            "It's not a particularly popular opinion, but I think really good, really *effective* automated tests are harder to build than actual code half the time.\n\nHowever, this reality clashes with the tech class system. Developers are high up and QA is low on the totem pole. I've yet to hear of a single company, anywhere that pays QA as much as developers. Once or twice Ive heard of \"SDET\"s who are treated as equivalent, but it still feels like something more in the realm of myth than reality.\n\nThis also has the side effect that many developers look down on writing tests and wont do it (\"isnt this what interns are for???\").\n\nId bet pretty good money your company is hiring QA people and paying market. Youre not hiring SDET people and paying developer money. Then youre giving the really hard, technical work to the guy who is 40% cheaper than everybody else and wondering where it all went wrong.\n\nThe economics of automated testing are a bit complicated. Sometimes it's worth it, sometimes it's not and calculating if it'll be worth it is often *hard* so people usually go on gut instinct. It's complicated by the fact that you can often get really good manual QA for cheap (best manual QA I ever worked with was an ex hairdresser) but good automation expertise requires $$$.\n\nHowever, cheaping out on it (which most companies do) is a *guaranteed* false economy.",
            "If QA is missing a lot of bugs, then so are the developer-written tests. Sometimes that's unavoidable, the bugs are exclusively in the full stack or they're simply extreme edge cases that people are naturally going to miss.\n\nSometimes, it means there's a lack of proper code ownership from the developers.\n\nIdeally, QA should have enough time to automate everything they're testing, as they're doing their manual testing. Things are rarely ideal, but if a QA can only spend 10% of their time automating, then there's no point in automating at all. They're going to constantly be too far behind to ever catch up.\n\nI don't agree with you on automated testing no catching things - to me that sounds like an immature test suite with poor definitions. Could be QA's fault, could the the developers, but most likely it's the company supplying insufficient QA resources to the tasks at hand.\n\nA good automated test suite can verify a full regression in under an hour for a system that takes days to do full regression on manually. That's invaluable when dealing with complex systems with hundreds of screen variations and dozens of user types. If your app is extremely straight forward, automated tests might be largely unnecessary. Most apps as they mature benefit from them quite a bit.",
            "QA and finding bugs is a separate mindset from being a good coder. Good testers try to understand and break the code.  They think of scenarios that users can do based on how things work that coders don't even think of.\n\nIt's not code shall do X, so test if X is possible.  That's a basic test.  You think about how X interplays with the rest of the system and see if you can break it.",
            "Having done manual QA, automated QA, and now being a software engineer, I think devs should own quality. \n\nThere should be no dedicated automated QA and no to minimal dedicated manual QA, at least at small to medium sized companies.\n\nAt first, you'll spend a bit more time manually testing things yourself, but as time goes on, without the crutch, you'll start baking quality in from the get-go. You'll spend less time context shifting when they get back to you a week later about a bug.",
            "I don't think you are wrong. There should be a lot of manual testing along with automated testing.  There are so many things that require domain knowledge and manual testing that automated testing will never catch.\n\nPerhaps, as you partially state, the company's mandate for the QA team is wrong or is allowing them to deviate from what a normal QA team is responsible for.  IMO, that is the wrong direction and it will show when product ships/deploys.",
            "I think it\u2019s just really hard to hire good QA. The barrier to entry is much lower than it is for devs, but doing QA well is not easy. There are absolutely 10x QA out there and it makes a huge difference working with them.",
            "QA is an entirely different mindset from development, so any time someone's goal is to be a developer I pass on them for a QA role. I spent most of my career on the testing side of things myself (bailing only because a centralized testing group needing a manager is well on its way out). \n\nIf you don't have that fundamental underlying tester mentality, then you're not going to get good test coverage. If you automate things you'll get through the tests faster but you won't find any more problems. I've also even seen just shitty tests which someone went and automated which was painful because they just had faster shit rather than good testing. \n\nI have absolutely nothing against automation, but the kind of tester who actually enjoys manual testing is, in my opinion, more likely to be a better tester. and resource They should have an innate curiosity about how things work, how they fit together, how things can go sideways and be a very divergent thinker. I would 100% prefer hiring from a support background because they have experience with what customers do and spend a lot of their time troubleshooting. The same skills used in troubleshooting are invaluable in testing - seeing something weird and poking around it to figure it out. Those who want to be developers tend more to be builders. They see how things should be and build them. Testers go around shaking everything because they're curious what would happen if they did. \n\nA really good tester? They'll sit in on design discussions and will start breaking your design before anyone even writes a line of code - when it is the absolute cheapest to fix. That's not the sort of skill set one can replace with automation. That kind of tester is very hard to find and only harder and harder as time goes on as the role of tester is dying now (whole other rant)",
            "Basically I don't think you're wrong *as such* but your embedded assumption seems to be that software quality happens in the qa team.\n\nAlternatively, software quality can happen at the strategic, product, and engineering levels. In the case of your first company, I assume that the QA team where largely doing invisible work forcing product and engineering to sort themselves out so that manual testing could happen.\n\nSecondly manual exploratory testing + scripted manual testing by a clued in QA engineer will tend to expose the unconsidered edge cases.\n\nOne good solution is to give the QA team the same job titles and pay scales as the dev teams, then hire people who can explain how a QA team fits into a good organisation. Make clear to the recruiters that you are in fact interested in people whose current job title is some variant of \"QA Peon\" and current software engineers with a demonstrated interest in QA, and not just looking to hoover up some software engineers who have never done QA before.\n\nAnother solution is to basically have a small automated test team whose main function is to say \"This isn't sufficiently specified to write tests what do you mean\" and have them ask the devs what tests they've already written to compensate for the difficulty of automated testing.\n\nAnother solution is to hire people with QA titles to be junior product managers so that testing resides with product, and have no separate QA function. Leave it to engineering to figure out how to catch mistakes.\n\nA fourth solution is to have a product function that doesn't test and leave testing up to engineering to figure out.",

X in this case would be regression.\n\nAutomation is not sentient AI that catches bugs, it's meant to speed up a manual process that someone knows. If no one knows what they're automating, how do they know they have a stable product (apart from users telling you, hey you broke this)?\n\nEssentially, I disagree that it's useless, but Company 2 is doing it wrong. As for the hiring part, if QA positions are lower-pay, lower-respect, you're-supposed-to-grow-out-of-it type of roles, no wonder people want to get away. Check how your company treats QA.",

            "TL;DR my preferences:\n\n* *Developers* write UAT tests against the app's top API.\n* A smoke test as a super integration test, written by DevOps.  Integration tests that just check external configuration, written by DevOps\n* Fewer QA.  QA activities should be more advanced, like exploratory and load testing.  QA may act as a BA.\n\nIMO, the industry is wrong-minded about QA and automated testing, including the two example companies.  I've worked at companies exactly like that.\n\nI'm **not a fan of E2E automated tests** (which usually means browser-driven tests, e.g. selenium/cypress).  They are **high effort, low impact**.  I think only a tiny few should exist as \"smoke\" tests, just to make sure everything is wired together correctly.  Smoke tests should be able to run against production.\n\nI think **developers should write UAT tests against a thin abstraction** over the top-level system API (i.e. service or controller classes), with a mocked or in-memory backend database.  (This thin layer directly matches the user story, and is easy for non-programmers to understand, similar to PageObjects.)  Most of these tests should be written by the developers, and should be reasonably fast.  They are **low effort, high impact**.  This is where most testing should occur.\n\n**QA automation testers should be** ***real*** **programmers** (not promoted QA), that write smoke tests (as above), and integration tests (just to make sure external APIs work).   Tbh, I think this should be a part of the DevOps role, not a specialized QA role.\n\nQA people should make sure that all of the above is happening well, and to do more advanced types of testing, like manual exploratory testing, load/stress/scalability testing, accessibility testing, penetration testing, etc.  QA might have BA responsibilities, such as listing out UAT use-cases in the user story/ticket.  Really, there should be very few QA personnel, but they should be highly skilled at detecting and preventing hard-to-find issues.",
            "A perfect QA should help automate the most boring parts of their job. Those happy path tests that they perform every single time? Those should be automated. They should also perform exploratory manual testing. This isn't just repeating the automated tests in a manual fashion. It's playing the role of a clueless user. \"What if I follow the steps out of order? What if I change my last name to Z\u00e6rch\u00f8r\u00fcnd? What if my password is a series of unicorn emojis?\".\n\nWhen helping define requirements, it's cool to include that perfect QA. Their mind is trained to ask questions we don't think of, and they can help identify predictable misuse of your features.\n\nI've only ever worked with one perfect QA. I've seen some very good, very creative QA's who had no coding skill and were only button pushers. They were great, and they only got better as we automated the boring parts of their jobs. \n\nIn short, I disagree with you on the value of automated tests. I think automating the most common test scenarios helps you get more out of a strong QA like the ones you had in company A.",
            ">I thought it was a useful but costly process to create and maintain automated tests.\n\nMy company has no QA at all, all testing is automated. Unit tests, integ tests, full CI/CD. We have way fewer bugs than my last company's products where every team had dedicated QA and all sorts of intensive manual testing efforts. I recall entire sprints spent dedicating everyone in the software department to nothing but QA before a new release. I guarantee you that was far more expensive than just making every dev write tests to go along with their code.",

            "Over the past 8 years or so the mantra has become \"Manual testing is bad/slow/not scalable, We must have 100% automation for reusable testing!\".   This has been adopted by many CTOs and pushed down to organizations.   IMHO of 27 years in the field, manual QAs are normally VERY good at knowing the system and finding edge cases.  Automation engineers are OK at coding (many of them are entry level and/or can not cut it as a full time DEV) and are not great at the skills needed to know a system to find good test uses cases.\n\nMy argument and what I have found to work in practice:  a 50/50ish split.  Manual testers that do what they are good at and identify edge cases in a system.  Feed the Automation engineers the specfic use cases so they can go off and script out the automation in Selenium (or whatever tool they choose).  \n\nThis is my stragety I try to deploy as a director of engineering in my organization.",

            "It seems like most of the industry misses the mark on what QA is; they confuse it with QC (quality control). QA is the whole process in which you make a quality product. QC is the random sampling of the assembly line to try understand your defect rate and perhaps catch the odd rat before it hits a customer. This is not your primary defence... you should have defence in layers.\n\nYou can't just add a ton of testers and expect your quality to go up. Even if they catch a ton of problems, that feedback loop is awful and you'll see it blow up like in the games industry all the time. This leads to death marches.\n\nYour team/company should have some expectations on what quality means and what they expect. Identify risks in the different areas (domain, your solution/product, implementation, etc.) and understand the impact of those risks happening.\n\nGood QA people will help you find or understand risks that you weren't aware of. Deep domain knowledge, context / history, understanding your specific users. They should help make these requirements more widely understood by the development team. It might touch upon security/privacy requirements, performance, accessibility, etc. They are the ambassador for your end-users or stakeholders.\n\nThey might also challenge you in how you'll test or prove confidence in your work. I've always thought the dev team should own the quality of the work, and use leverage that risk-aware mentality of QA to get there.  QA can help drive requirements, but you need to put the work in. You need to know how you'll test your work at a meaningful layer that gives you the confidence to ship it (and negotiate those lines as a team).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, in order to meet that quality bar, you have several tools at your disposal:\n\n\\- static analysis / linting to catch more obvious errors\n\n\\- unit tests to aid design and give developers a fast feedback loop\n\n\\- integration (or wider scoped tests) to ensure the system operates\n\n\\- end to end tests to simulate user behaviour\n\n\\- smoke tests to catch obviously bad deploys (or canary releases, same idea)\n\n\\- manual testing (exploratory)\n\n\\- code review / pair programming\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMany of these things are more technical and are to biased towards catching software defects. Based on the cost/runtime of these things, you may want to run them more or less frequently (on save, on commit, on push, pre-merge, post-merge, pre-release, post-deploy, etc.). Cost decision.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, most of these tools do not address the problem/solution space of what your product actually does.  Good QA people will help find these things and hopefully help you get better at finding these things to strengthen the team and deliverables so you can make better test cases.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you delegate \"QA\" your feedback loop becomes horribly broken.

A good SDET will prevent more bugs than 50 manual testers. Notice i said prevent, the bugs won't actually be committed given a solid CI system along with those tests. \n\nI started my career as an SDET, we were required to have domain and product knowledge on par with the devs, we did some manual exploratory testing, but the vast majority was writing tests and frameworks for testing an operating system. We had a team in India we contracted out most of the redundant push button/manual testing and the maintenance of existing tests.  I didn't have a very high opinion of their abilities. \n\nThe perpetual problem is that any good SDET doesn't stay an SDET for long, i jumped over to dev after a couple years, the other really good people left for dev roles at other companies. Whats left is generally not the best. This is why most modern companies are doing away with most QA, you just can't get the talent.",
            "First off you have to view QA as a profession. That means that you have to look for professional testers and be very wary of those who want to transition to development or product. They can be good, but they won't approach things the same way as a professional tester. Percy was the kind of guy you all should have made a junior developer or cut loose. People like him don't do well compared to those at your first company because their priorities don't align with the job they were hired for. A professional tester has the vandal mentality, wants to know the product inside out and is willing to grind execution of an edge case in the same way a developer may spend 4-8 hours straight on a bug. Most people don't have that in them. I was a tester for a few years and can tell you at no point did I have the in me. Hell I remember one lady who spent a solid week testing a POS system trying to reproduce a bug that made a volume slider keep moving automatically until the program finally crashed. \n\nI'm not going to say your CTO is wrong but automation is really hard to get correct, especially UI automation. Often you end up testing things that don't provide enough value when weighed against maintenance. I wouldn't call it sunk costs but having a mix of manual and automation testers who work together is IMO the sweet spot. That way the manual work takes priority but you still get automation around critical areas. \n\nFWIW if your automation isn't catching things then your team is automating the wrong stuff. Where I work now we have people whose sole focus is writing automated tests. That's cool and all but they tend to miss a lot because there's too many failures to evaluate or they don't focus on just automating critical paths. They also tend to work independently of the development team and their team's manual tester meaning that often by the time they finish some automation, the feature has changed.",

It's just software engineering with a specific flavor.  \nManual testers are experience experts, and will be a lot better at telling you how the software actually works, and not whether the tests you wrote say it *should* work.  \nThe concept of 'shift left' tries to approach this - using defect prevention (through automation and process efficiency) removes the need for defect *detection* (manual testing), which is more expensive and doesn't increase overall development speeds.

Working with legacy Java code is a total slog, it's a boilerplatey mess full of terrible abstraction and forced OOP. However in recent years with the addition of records, sealed interfaces, pattern matching and a few other niceties borrowed from functional languages it's gotten a lot better, and it seems to be improving at a much faster pace than it used to. I actually don't mind writing modern Java 21+. It's certainly not my favorite but it's not bad. It's also absolutely everywhere in backend development, I don't think I've ever interviewed for or worked at a company that didn't use either Java or C# (basically Java but better) in some capacity.\n\nGolang is the opposite. It has a great reputation, which astounds me because it's one of the most poorly designed languages I've ever used. It seemingly learned nothing from the past 40 years of software development.  Error handling alone leads to way more boilerplate and clutter than any Java code I've ever written. The type system is pathetically weak, even C has better enum support. Whoever thought nil pointers and default zero values were a good idea for a language made in the 21st century should be banned from designing programming languages from now on, that's been an endless source of stupid bugs that could've easily been caught ahead of time.

        "title": "Falling Back on Past Experience",
        "content": "I have worked in the IT field for over 25 years with the last 5 years being in a management role.  When I was presented with the opportunity to go into management I had a lot of unsettled concerns because I felt the change in my identity would make it difficult to fall back on the years of experience that I had gained getting hands-on technical skills.  Sure I could still list those years and skills on my resume, but with the speed at which technology and the industry trends change my skills would quickly become outdated or at least no longer cached in my memory and difficult to sell myself when interviewing.\n\nI eventually fell victim to the \u2018Oh so common, Power of the Mighty Dollar\u201d and went for the management position.  I have to admit, I loved working in that role.  I got energized with the leadership role\u2019s perspective and looking out into the future and coming up with strategic plans to keep the company competitive and a leader in the industry by having an innovative technical advantage.  I also got great satisfaction from working with my team and building loyalty and knew that I could always count on them coming through.  It was rewarding to see them to achieve performance levels that were once beyond our imagination.\n\nOne of the disadvantages of having this role is I could see that the cost advantages were taking us in a path that would mean we would start outsourcing services and move into the cloud and would no longer need the the technical staff that I was managing and even the need for my position would eventually be eliminated.  Feeling the commitment that I had to the company and even more so to my team, I stayed aboard until the ship had sunk and I was laid off after being with that company for 20 years.\n\nWhen I started to look for other management jobs, I had difficulty finding them and have ended up needed to fall back on my past experience.  The problem is, my greatest fears of taking that step away from being a person that keeps the ship a sail have come true.  I needed to get a refresher on those skills that I once knew inside out and I also needed to gain new current skills required in the industry.\n\nI am so excited to have come across Job Skill Share while searching on YouTube for training.  The mission of this site is exactly what someone like me needs in order to make my past relevant again.  Hopefully the community continues to grow and those that benefit from this training can one day Pay-It-Forward and offer their expertise to this community.\n\nMy advice to someone thinking about entering the IT industry.  IT is a great profession because it is exciting and always evolving.  So consider gaining skills that specialize in a technology that is trending but the skills remain viable.  Something comparable to an Accounting or Marketing career.  Even though the tax laws or marketing strategies change, you can alway use the core skills that you have obtained.  Good Luck and enjoy the ride!!!\n\nhttp://www.jobskillshare.org/falling-back-on-past-experience/",

        "content": "TLDR: 60yr old father got hurt at work and can no longer continue his career (mechanic).\n\nAdvice needed: What careers can 60yr old expect to get with no college education that will make around 50k a year.\n\nBackground Info: So my dad (60M) has been a mechanic for over 30 years now. He specializes in transmissions and has solely worked only on them for majority of this time. About 8 months ago, while handling a transmission it slipped and he got his left hand (dominant hand) caught. This incident has caused him to go on worker's comp and he has had multiple surgeries along with physical therapy. His hand has improved but not to the point of returning back to normal. Besides the lack of strength in his hand, he can't move it much either. This issue he is running in with now, is that his last surgeon has given up trying to help him and said that he can return to work. He is exercising his right to get a second opinion. Even though he can \"return\" to work during this time, as he waits for an appointment for the second opinion, he really cannot do the job and his boss is hesitant about bringing him back because mechanic shops aren't the best when it comes to workplace safety and the boss is cheap so doesn't want the possibility of another injury happening. Additionally, he wont be able to work as well as their new builder that they brought in, while my dad has been out. I honestly do not know what careers he can transition into. I have asked multiple technical schools about possible instructor positions because he has so much experience, but they all require some sort of secondary education for teaching. He isn't getting younger and is not very technologically literate. Any ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  \n\n\nFYSA: He has been working with a lawyer but from he has been told Florida is one of the worst states when it comes to compensation for a workplace injury and is not expecting to get much if anything through it.",

I know some personal experience that really fucks with your head and how you interact with the world, and how you perceive your interactions with the world.\n\nIn the early 1990s, I developed a repetitive strain injury that killed my career as a software developer. Long story short, I had to go through some significant reinvention and, more importantly, re-envisioning who I am and where my real value is. It was hard. There was a lot of denial, rage and depression about this disability.\n\nYour father can get through this. Listen to him. Don't be surprised if he seems completely lost at times. I highly recommend getting him into some sort of therapy to talk about this loss of health, work, and everything he may have felt defined him.\n\nOne caution, however, is that he will probably talk about not being a burden. Again, entirely expected and normal. However, if it progresses to pulling back from friends and social connections, and especially if he starts giving away personal items or tools, talk to him about if he's feeling suicidal. \n\nHere's some really helpful information what to look for and how to deal with it. https://ncoa.org/article/suicide-and-older-adults-what-you-should-know\n\nI cannot emphasize enough how important it is just ask. If my (ex)wife hadn't been paying attention at the time and hadn't asked what was going on, I probably would've attempted suicide. Simply asking broke the doom loop hallucination of \"I'm being a burden\", \"she doesn't need me\", \"I'm ruining her life\" On breaking the doom loop, I was able to get the mental health care needed to reframe and rebuild my life. \n\nWhile I haven't gone through with his exact situation.  If he wants to talk, I can listen. PM me.",

Her goal was to change her career every decade in life and live to age 100. She was super level headed and just an absolute joy to be around. That was more than 10 years ago and I am now changing my career for the sake of my joy in life. I didn't set out to be like her, but I fully understand this desire to change about every decade.

I don't really ever intend to stay in a particular job, I like switching every few years based on how the world and my interests are changing.\n\nI have never had a pay cut. Every time I switch I am more senior than before, in the new domain.\n\nI do this by just delivering projects that carry weight in the new domain before I switch. I meet people in that space, deliver value for with them until they are impressed enough to want me to work with them full time, and opportunistically take the best situation I can find or create.\n\nIf I wanted to switch to interior design from engineering, personally I wouldn't go to school, I would go do interior design, and I would try to lean into the advantages you have from your current skill set.\n\nI don't know you, but if you are from a mechanical/civil/etc background you are probably much better at 3d drafting than most interior designers. I would take advantage of that, maybe just start drawing designs, doing photorealistic renders, and posting them online as a way to practice and start a portfolio.\n\nPersonally, if it were me I would probably get a 360 3d camera like is used for matterport, do a 3d model of a real space, then show before and after. Basically, I would do virtual staging for houses like you see on Zillow, both realistically, and taken to a kind of artistic extreme, feel it out. Maybe document the process and thinking on YouTube as a kind of speed art, or tiktok summarizing the ideas. Once people like your work, maybe offer to do followers' houses first for free and then as commission, give them a matterport space they can walk through in VR. \n\nFrom there I would try to meet people in the space, find projects to work on with people in my spare time while keeping my eng job, create value for people first, and just see where it goes.\n\nThat's basically the formula of how I switch careers every time, applied to interior design based on my limited understanding of how that field works.",

Scary and exciting. Should have my degree in under 2 years.\n\nRegarding your position, I think that maybe an opportunity exists for intersectional work. You have experience in a desirable field.  There is lots of overlap between engineering and many other fields. Find a field you want to step into, and either apply for jobs in the alternate field with the engineering experience on the table and an offer of fresh eyes (learning as you go, in and of itself, can be a thrilling and exciting thing) , or definitely get right back into school. With an engineering degree already established, much of the busy-work will be done away with and you can hop right into your field-specific courses. You may even discover some intersectionality that may not have been available before.

The grass might appear greener on the other side because it's easy to acclimate to a a consistent job and life style. A switch to interior design might scratch a creative itch, but would probably take a long time to recover to a similar financial level.\n\nPerhaps instead of making a complete change from one to the other, you could do so gradually. Start by taking the interior design courses while still working, or try launching your business on a limited part time basis.\n\ntldr; you do you and it's never too late, but be intentional with it",
            "Hey! I did something similar at 35!\n\nFor some context, I got laid off during COVID and decided to enroll in community college for Architecture Design and Drafting. My program overlapped with the Interior Design program, so I often took ID courses too.\n\nDon't let your age hold you back. You have an advantage! First, you've been earning money and can support yourself through school. Second, your maturity and life experience will help keep you motivated and focused.\n\nIn my program, a lot of people were starting fresh, and their experiences only made things more interesting. Learning from each other is one of the best parts of being in a design field. Sometimes I thought the younger students would be competition, but the truth is, everyone has strengths and weaknesses. Just focus on being a good communicator, listener, proactive, persistent, and reliable \u2014 those qualities will take you far. The only thing you need to do is focus on your learning and your success so leave anything holding you back at the door.\n\nI was the oldest intern this summer, and even though the other interns could've been my kids, I had a great experience and never let any insecurities about my age hold me back! I stayed focused on my success, and it's paid off. Out of the few people in my program who have internships, nobody else in my program had an internship as cool as mine. I feel weird saying cool but honestly, it's been incredibly supportive and not one person has made me feel bad about my age and I also never brought it up because why should I?\n\nI\u2019m graduating in December and interning at an engineering firm. Most people in my program dont consider this path because they want to do residential design -- their perogative. But I found my path in a recession proof industry and I'm excited that my open mind and hard work got me here.\n\nI also want to add that many of my professors had high-paying jobs before they made the switch to Interior Design or Architecture. Now, they teach and run their own firms. Two of my favorite teachers were former students who started their own businesses, and I learned so much from them. They were truly inspiring \u2014 plus, being the same age made them even more relatable, which really helped. I personally dont think that everyone should start their own business right out of community college but it is possible. My point is that everyone's got a different path and you being in your 30's going back to school is not unique -- you will be in good company. \n\nFunny how our paths align! If I had let my age be a factor, I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today. Set your goals, stay open-minded, and don\u2019t compare yourself to others. It will only drain your joy and motivation.

            "Absolutely, making a career change after spending over a decade in higher education is a significant and brave step.

Highlight your skills, achievements, and the unique perspective you bring from your higher education background.\n\n**2. Networking:** Join LinkedIn groups relevant to your new career interest, connect with alumni from your MBA program, and don't hesitate to reach out to people in roles you're interested in. Informational interviews can also be invaluable.\n\n**3. Upgraded Job Alerts:** Tailor your job search by setting up customized alerts for roles you're interested in. This will help you keep track of opportunities that align with your career goals.\n\nChanging careers can be daunting, but it's also a chance to reinvent yourself.

        "content": "Hello everyone, I (24F) am an entrepreneur who has been active primarily in industrial manufacturing and gaming, and now I am trying to find a suitable career path without a degree.\n\nMy situation is quite complex, but I will break it down into simple steps. I studied mechanical engineering and double-majored in Innovation & Design at one of the most prestigious universities in Asia as an international student from Turkey. During the pandemic, I was back in my home country, and my education was online, so I started a mask-making business. I built the business and sold over 20 million masks to six different countries. Afterwards, I returned to Singapore to resume my studies, but things were never the same for me, and I struggled to focus on being a student again.\n\nI then built another business where I acted as the middleman between Turkish industrial manufacturers (mostly CNC machining, injection molding, and sheet metal work) and the U.S. I used my e-commerce skills and knowledge in the field to create a solid network that allowed the business to grow.\n\nOnce I grew my capital, I returned to Turkey, bought CNC machines, and invested in other industrial equipment. At the same time, I owned a Far East restaurant in Istanbul and was a board member at a hospital in my home city. After the machines arrived, we started manufacturing mostly mining equipment, and we currently hold two defense contracts. I also had consultant roles for two large Chinese companies, both state-owned.\n\nIt may be hard to believe, but I also have a gaming company with a few childhood friends. We are now in our second investment round, with a desired valuation of 1.5 million USD. I am the financial lead.\n\nWith all of this, I managed to drop out of two different universities\u2014one in law and one in international relations. These were Turkish universities, and I only enrolled out of curiosity about the fields.\n\nThroughout my career, I\u2019ve always been a problem solver, mostly focused on optimization and sales, and I was the person to establish networks and use them effectively.\n\nBut here is where it gets tricky: I need to leave Turkey due to some family issues. I sold my manufacturing and restaurant businesses, I am on the verge of selling my gaming company, and I want to move out of Turkey by finding a job. I have applied to various jobs, but I imagine that not having a degree is a problem for HR professionals. It\u2019s also very tough to find suitable roles when you have all this entrepreneurial experience but have never worked in a company. I know I would be a valuable addition to any company\u2019s workforce under the right terms, but I don\u2019t know how to express that.\n\nThe first time I prepared a CV was only 10 days ago because, before that, I had never applied anywhere\u2014not even for an internship.\n\nI need guidance and a roadmap. I desperately need to leave Turkey for the time being, and I would like to have a stable income while doing so and shift my career in that direction. What are your thoughts?\n\nP.S.: I don\u2019t want to build another business. I am very tired of my family issues. I need stability.",

My current position I\u2019ve been seeking to transition from is a buyer job for a company that buys and resales items on Amazon for profit. My job involves using apps to determine the sales and price history of items I find online or in stores to determine if they will be profitable for us to buy and resale and for what price. I\u2019ve done this since high school in a lower position and increased in responsibility over the years, including my post-college years.

I don\u2019t know somebody who knows somebody, so I\u2019m reliant upon responding to job posts or reaching out to people on LinkedIn. So far, based on job posts and response history, the vast majority of entry-level jobs in my area demand or want more precise experience that I don\u2019t have, so I don\u2019t get considered or am rejected by the ATS criteria. I\u2019ve tried staffing agencies, but I\u2019m told by them that they don\u2019t have a buyer position, so they can\u2019t help me. I\u2019ve gotten desperate for jobs, and the only jobs that have been willing to hire are jobs that later turned out to be pure commission sales jobs. So far, it seems all I have are transferable skills, and I\u2019m wondering what kinds of jobs would realistically hire someone with just this experience or do I need to skill up and get some kind of certification or another degree?

I started coding on Apple ][ when I was 10, roaming the BBS's in mid 80s, building PCs, networks, security systems, video systems, servers, domains, etc for over 30 years now. All of my colleagues already call me to help them. I think I would like to test the waters and start a tech support firm that would specialize in small medical practices - something I know well.  I've already been doing this for a long time so I don't think I'll be caught with my pants down. It's my passion as much as my primary career.  \n\nWhat am I looking at in terms of startup?

You better be on call 24/7 to fix some morons printer for the 17th time today.  Did you sell server config and maintenance?  You should be fine just working nights and weekends patching things.\n\n> Is it not as fun once you start getting paid for it?\n\nNothing is as fun once you are paid to do it.  Even on the absolute best days, there will be aspects you don't want to do that you wouldn't have to if you weren't getting paid.  Figure out what those aspects are that you don't like, and how they would change if you were doing it for a living.\n\nEdit: formatting",
            "> What am I looking at in terms of startup?\n\nAs a medical professional I'm sure you realize the importance of a good attorney.  They're just as important in IT.  You'll probably want someone to get you up and running with the business paperwork, assuming you're planning on starting above board.  Avoid services like LegalZoom like the plague.\n\nYou'll also want some liability insurance.  Aside from covering your ass (admittedly in 20 years I've never had to file a claim) some companies that outsource to me require me it.\n\nAll of that said.  I'd recommend instead of trying to jump straight in to the shady side of IT (because consulting is fucking shady, coming from a consultant), maybe take a part time gig as a support tech or tier 2 engineer.  Your passion doesn't translate to real work experience.  Source: I've made a living cleaning up for passionate people with zero business perspective."

My responsibilities include triaging bugs and troubleshooting ITSM software and web applications. Additionally, I resolve bugs and issues, which often involves making small changes to SQL queries or JavaScript in ETL processes. I also query data from databases to analyze workflows and troubleshoot processes. I collaborate with CMDB, Solution Architects, and Developers to devise solutions. While I have some exposure to GCP, GKE, and Linux, my primary tasks involve retrieving logs, restarting pods, and updating secrets.\n\nI secured this job last year, and although it's a contract position, they renewed my contract at the end of last year. About 70% of my team members are also on contracts. I find the work enjoyable, appreciate the company culture, the people, and the learning opportunities. Moreover, since the business is involved with the government, it seems stable. Our business unit didn't experience any layoffs during the recent downturn in the IT industry.\n\nNow, I have a couple of questions:\n\n1. I perceive it's quite challenging to transition into the software or web development engineering fields these days. Therefore, I'm considering a role in cloud engineering, DevOps, or SRE. Outside of work, I'm studying courses related to cloud and SRE. I understand these roles typically require mid to senior-level experience, but they align with my interests. Can anyone advise on how to transition from a support role and maximize my salary?\n2. Recently, I received an offer for a similar role/job title from a digital advertising platform SaaS company with over 1000 employees, operating for 10 years. The offer is tempting with a higher salary and additional perks. However, the role is more limited to application support without involvement in Linux and cloud technologies. I would leverage my SQL and JavaScript skills to troubleshoot issues. Should I accept this offer? While the salary increase is significant, I'm concerned about the stability of the advertising industry, which typically suffers during economic recessions. They assured me that they haven't had any layoffs since their establishment and are profitable.\n\nI've been feeling uncertain about my career path and future lately. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

My degree is in management information systems.  I started my career doing SAP consulting with one of the big IT firms, got married, did SAP for a large oil company for another couple of years (about 5 years doing SAP in total), and then got promoted to management and spent the rest of the time doing application management (ran a 2nd/3rd level IT support team, ITIL functions, change management, etc).\n\nI have a SCRUM Master certification, Six Sigma Green Belt, and ITIL Foundation, however, my jobs have only directly involved ITIL and a bit of six sigma.\n\nI've been unemployed for a year, and live in a fairly rural area.  I'd like to move to a large city/metropolitan area, no larger than Chicago.\n\nI am not sure where to go next. I've done applications for jobs for SAP work, where it seems like I don't have enough technical experience for anything other the 'entry level' application analysts.  I've also applied for application managers, but many teams are in a DevOps mode now, and my lack of development experience has been a negative, as well as only being a manager for a few years.  When I managed a team, I had about 8 line reports (support analysts), and 10 outsourced reports (developers).\n\nI'm also having trouble getting any responses from companies that are outside of my geography, even though I have no desire to live in rural Illinois any longer.\n\nI am currently unemployed and have been for about a year.  I went through a divorce, moved back in with my parents in a rural area and have struggled to find work.\n\nI would be happy going off to have training, but want to get training in something that has a high amount of job opportunities.\n\nI, in general, like working in a capacity of business facing IT work, not purely development/technical.  My degree is a business college degree in IT.\n\nI was thinking, MAYBE get some SAP training/certification as I really enjoy that work, but my lack of experience in the last 5 years might be holding me back from starting by getting a more advanced certification.\n\nI did really enjoy working with manufacturing/supply chain/purchasing/accounting parts of a business.\n\nI also was thinking maybe cybersecurity. In college, I worked as an administrator for a few years, doing basic routing, gateways, server management (Windows primarily), Exchange, SharePoint, SQL Server, etc.  I did enjoy that work a lot.\n\nPlease help!

It doesn't matter to me if you can memorize information and regurgitate it for an exam. I want to know that you have actually worked with the technologies and can think critically.\n\nAs for the Certs vs Degree debate, you get different answers because they are both correct...\n\nIf you are applying to an MSP or a small company where a technical person is handling the hiring process, they will likely care more about certifications.\n\nIf you are applying to a larger company/enterprise where HR is the first person to see your resume, they will likely care more about the degree.\n\nMy recommendation would be to pursue both the Certs and the degree, and to try to build a /r/homelab of your own and start working and learning the actual implementation of different technologies. Then, when you get into interviews, you can talk about when you *implemented* such-and-such rather than when you read about it.\n\nCheers"

We provided both retail PC repair/tune-up work, and business IT services. We closed the shop when he left and I started a new business on my own, working from home. I took over our existing IT contracts (which I had mostly served on my own), and still provide in-home support for some of our \"legacy\" customers.\n\nI really enjoy what I do, but the ratio of time spent doing marketing and accounting compared to actual IT work is way too high. I also have a lot of free time that's not exactly mine, that is, I need to be around. If I want to take a few days off, I have to warn a dozen different people, and they may have nobody else to call if something happens while I'm gone.\n\nThe problem is that I really don't know what type of jobs I should be applying for, or what sort of pay to ask for. I have experience with supporting small businesses, from 1-30 employees. I handle everything from planning new office buildouts; terminating voice and data cabling; setting up routers/switches/wifi; spec'ing and building servers and workstations; setting up and administering AD, Exchange, Office365, QuickBooks, etc; and providing desk-side assistance with hardware, applications, you name it.\n\nFrom what I've read, I'd be miserable stuck in a \"helpdesk\" role, as working directly with users is the most frustrating thing I do, but I'm fine if it's a small part of the job. I'm good at explaining things, and acting like I don't want to punch people.\n\nMost of the jobs that look like a good fit for me are \"system administrator\" or \"network systems specialist\", though there are usually one or two specific things I have little or no experience with, such as BizTalk and WebSphere. I'm good at picking things up quickly so I'm not worried about it in terms of doing the actual job, but I'm worried that a recruiter is going to be put off by that. I've always been highly adaptable.\n\nThe one nearby listing that actually offers up a salary range is $5000-$7000/mo. This is for a government (city hall) job. I could live with anywhere in there honestly, but I'd prefer more. Is this a reasonable range to apply to the private sector (assuming comparable benefits package)?\n\nAlso - would most recruiters value my experience similar to someone who's been in an IT department for the same kind of time? More/less?",

So you have a plus in that you have experience right up their ally.  The plus side is for a guy like you they would give you a job in the range you are looking for.  But to be honest you will probably hate it after a while.  Usually (not always)  management sucks in these companies, they are all about billing and you won't have a lot of downtime to catchup on learning new tech.  \n\nMy suggestion, get on LinkedIn.  I know a lot of people hate it but it is marketing and you are used to that.  Join a number of tech groups there.  Connect with all your customers and their subordinates.  You might think why?  How are they going to help me? It is not necessarily them who will help you but the people they know.  Connect with recruiters,  I have never had a problem working with a head hunter who speaks English.  They don't cost you anything and your willingness to work with them puts you ahead of the curve.  \n\nBased of the way you write I am guessing you are in the northeast?  New England area?

My responsibilities include triaging bugs and troubleshooting ITSM software and web applications. Additionally, I resolve bugs and issues, which often involves making small changes to SQL queries or JavaScript in ETL processes. I also query data from databases to analyze workflows and troubleshoot processes. I collaborate with CMDB, Solution Architects, and Developers to devise solutions. While I have some exposure to GCP, GKE, and Linux, my primary tasks involve retrieving logs, restarting pods, and updating secrets.\n\nI secured this job last year, and although it's a contract position, they renewed my contract at the end of last year. About 70% of my team members are also on contracts. I find the work enjoyable, appreciate the company culture, the people, and the learning opportunities. Moreover, since the business is involved with the government, it seems stable. Our business unit didn't experience any layoffs during the recent downturn in the IT industry.\n\nNow, I have a couple of questions:\n\n1. I perceive it's quite challenging to transition into the software or web development engineering fields these days. Therefore, I'm considering a role in cloud engineering, DevOps, or SRE. Outside of work, I'm studying courses related to cloud and SRE. I understand these roles typically require mid to senior-level experience, but they align with my interests. Can anyone advise on how to transition from a support role and maximize my salary?\n2. Recently, I received an offer for a similar role/job title from a digital advertising platform SaaS company with over 1000 employees, operating for 10 years. The offer is tempting with a higher salary and additional perks. However, the role is more limited to application support without involvement in Linux and cloud technologies. I would leverage my SQL and JavaScript skills to troubleshoot issues. Should I accept this offer? While the salary increase is significant, I'm concerned about the stability of the advertising industry, which typically suffers during economic recessions. They assured me that they haven't had any layoffs since their establishment and are profitable.\n\nI've been feeling uncertain about my career path and future lately.

Pace was super fast at first (on par with my MSP experience), and now is super slow now that I've fixed a lot of the common issues. I've since filled the time with research and operational tasks. Coming from an MSP background, my inclination was to work with the existing MSP as best as possible and preserve those relationships rather than the hostile approach I've seen internal Sysadmins take. \n\nThe stuff MSP sucks at (That you can do better), take off their plate and deliver this yourself. It can be difficult to make your work as an IT personnel \"visible\" to your laymen boss and peers, so use every opportunity like this that you can in order to build confidence and trust. The MSP is probably doing something right if they've maintained this relationship for so long. Allow them to continue to do those things right, but evaluate them and then deliver those evaluations to whom it most concerns.\n\nSomething else: The company brought me on as an IT Manager / Network Admin, but it's actually a wear as many hats as you want situation. That is to say, if you see an opportunity to generate value then do the footwork to see if it's feasible and makes sense ESPECIALLY if it's not a technical fix.\n\nI've calculated that the value I've generated here is about %50 Technical and %50 Process oriented, so be on the lookout for things you think can be improved.\n\nObviously I'm very new to this situation myself, but I hope this gives you some insight. Would love to hear the approach you plan to build out your department. I have Chief aspirations myself and have given myself a 10 year timeline. (7 years would be dope too though)",
            "So some things I would suggest before taking on this kind of role\n\n* Do you have management experience, if not will some one in upper management be there to mentor you?\n* Do you have sales/purchasing experience, have you ever negotiated large contracts with vendors or on behalf of vendors?\n* What kind of authority will you be given to run your department, will you be able to propose a budget and be given a free hand, or will you have to justify every expense, Do you know how to do a budget? do you know how to manage operation expenses or Capital expenses?\n* How does the company's upper management culture see IT, Is it purely a cost center, a profit center, a risk management and productivity engine, or something else?  How the business see's IT will determine how the department is treated.\n* How does the business's future strategy include tech and IT?\n* How will IT resources justify themselves, how will IT projects be measured for success or failure, how will IT priorities be weighted against business priorities.\n* Do you fall under a CTO, a COO, or a CFO.  If you fall under a CFO you are probably considered an expense by the business, if you fall under a COO you are probably considered critical to the operations of the business, if you fall under a CTO then the business is starting to consider tech as part of their business strategy.\n\nFinally, keep in mind a director is a management role, its going to have very little overlap with your sysadmin role - you will need the tech experience to help develop strategy and policy, but you will NOT be implementing your policy, instead you will be hiring the right sysadmins or MSP's to help enact that policy.  I've seen some Sysadmin roles where you had to negotiate software or partner contracts, but that will be a much bigger part of your role.  You might still be the key player in planning a major system upgrade, but especially as you learn to trust the people under you as Subject matter Experts, you should be less and less involved in the details, so you can focus on solving the next hair on fire problem for the business.  \n\nSome people really don't like that kind of mindset, and don't enjoy the accounting, the reports or the people management, and want to focus on the details of the big cool projects - but that way often leads towards micromanagement and a bad department so if you think this is you - its probably best to stay out of a manager role and instead ask for more responsibility as a System Architect or some elevated sysadmin role allowing you to advise the manager they eventually hire.",

You could greatly improve their IT landscape by just doing some common sense things, like making sure updates are happening, backups are happening, AV software is installed, etc.\n* Cleaning up a mess can actually be really good experience on how to get things done.

        "content": "I've been going back and forth on how I want my ticketing system to work and would like some feedback from others.\n\nMy helpdesk team is currently 3 people, next level is sysadmin along with netadmin.  My helpdesk guys have a bit more access and are able/allowed to handle a bit more technical tickets compared to other helpdesks I have worked at in my career.  I was using a free for all ticketing system, but found the newer people were naturally always afraid to pickup tickets.  So I went to round robin to fix that. \n\nI have noticed a disparity on the types of tickets people are receiving.  Some weeks one person will only get super easy tickets while others will get some heavy lifters which end up taking most of their time and their tickets back up.  For whatever reason they're struggling with sharing the load, I am still trying to decipher if it's laziness, or just lack of maturity.  However, I'm starting to feel like it's time to go back to free for all.  We average 10-15 tickets a day coming in from other departments and only have a handful of daily tasks which the current \"on-call\" person handles when they come in.  \n\nWe're currently fairly consistent with staying within +3/-3 for the day on total tickets a day opened/closed, so there isn't really an issue.  However, there is a disparity on the types of tickets some of the people receive and there are some gaps in the round robin where it does not automatically assign and those tickets get looked over 9 times out of 10 until I tell someone to pick them up 5+ hours after they've just been sitting unassigned in the queue. \n\nMy overall goal for this change is to create more unity within the 3 people to pickup tickets or assign them to their team members when they come in.  Really to create better cohesion within the team.  2 of the guys are fairly solid.  One of them is very hit or miss, but is showing improvement each month, just not up to the level I'd hope for.  Curious to hear everyone's thoughts.  \n\nFrom a people management perspective, I do 1on1 meetings bi-weekly with each team member and do give them objectives to work on over the 2 weeks such as \"I want you to be more prompt with XYZ\", or \"I'd like to see better documentation on your tickets\", etc. which all of them normally hit.

The group will help each other out but generally any ticket that comes up in your area, your'e the one held responsible for. I've found this helps with the distribution of weighted tickets and keeps the cherry pickers at bay somewhat. I wouldn't do this system in a bigger more traditional helpdesk. Previous places where I had 25+ techs we did round robin and I had a dedicated ticket manager who would distribute heavier weighted tickets evenly. In team meetings review your ticket numbers, don't just look at it surface level. If you want to discourage cherry pickers and stat buffers, call it out by looking at specific tickets etc. \n\nI do get the occasional ticket that sits untouched. I usually find these when I do ticket review Mondays and Friday. I will then manually assign those out based on who I think can handle it etc. \n\nTechs not actively taking on those weighted tickets I try to encourage in 1 on 1s.

But once they're caught up or just waiting for a response, they'd be in available status. Though this was a bigger team of technicians, maybe 10-12.\n\nFor a team that small, free for all should work.

How can I find out? Currently, I am making 135k which is what some of my developers are making also.\n\nTo give some background, I have been an IT manager for 2.5 years. I was working as a ERP Tech Lead for many years but when my manager left, I was asked if I was interested and I took the role of the app team manager. I have gone from a tech lead to overseeing 7 different applications and managing 20 people. Over the summer, I also managed 7 interns. I don't just manage people, I manage projects and am involved in the tech side making sure we are using the right technologies. I work overtime and try to stay on top of everything because this is all new to me.\n\nI got a 10k raise and went from 125k to 135k when I became a manager back in 2021 but then the company as a whole cut down on retirement and profit-sharing benefits so really my overall package didn't change.\n\nSo far in my career, I have never asked for a raise but when I become a manager I saw they all my team members ask for raises constantly.\n\nI appreciate any advice you can give!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

Try to think how you can take those 20 developers and create 3-5 sub-teams, create 3-5 team leads/manager, promote yourself to SR manager. \n\nThis will result you:\n\n* managing 3-5 teams,\n* more attention to projects,\n* ability to perform strategic review of projects and technology,\n* and most importantly allow team members to progress in their careers.\n\nAs a SR manager, you will be in higher salary band, you will be viewed as a strategic thinker/manager. Of course, this hinges on a very important fact that your company and your manager value their workforce.\n\nGood luck!!!!",

            "Normally, if you're managing 20 people (which is a lot of people to be managing directly), you should make substantially more than the people on your team.

So if people on your team are making $135k, I'd expect your salary to be at least something like $160k.\n\nHowever, nobody here can tell you what an appropriate salary is.  It depends on the company, industry, exactly what you do, and exactly what experience you have.\n\nMy general advice for asking for a raise is to go in with one of three arguments prepared:\n\n1. This is what I've already done that I think means I should have gotten a raise.\n2. This is what I'd like to do that I think would justify a raise.\n3. Here's market research that shows I'm simply underpaid altogether.\n4. I already have a job offer, and I'm giving you the opportunity to counter.\n\nThe risks of each:\n\n1. Some bosses might hear this and think, \"Well I've already gotten you to do that, so I don't need to give you a raise to motivate you to do it.\"\n2. This is probably the strongest argument, but it's possible they don't value what you're saying you want to do.\n3. Some bosses/HR already know they underpay, and they believe that the money they save from underpaying people will make up for the costs in turnover.  In that case, you might want to be prepared to find a new job.\n4. You almost never want to take the counter offer to stay where you are.  Even if it's a good counter-offer, if you take it, a lot of bosses/companies will then see you as disloyal, and may even look to fire you and replace you in the near future.",

I am at this company a minimum of another 11 months (May 2025) due to paying off a relocation fee. I promote collaboration, psychological safety,  and autonomy. I really like what I do and who I work with. \n\nI took a year off from IT Service Management (ITSM) to take a position as a Sr Data Specialist in ServeNow Performance Analytics at the same company and it did not go great, I was out of my element and it showed. I was the only person in my company who did what I did and had almost no one to bounce ideas off of in a newly formed part of the organization. My performance and work suffered and I eventually ended up back in the position I am in now. I have switched job roles plenty of times in my IT career but never had I felt that unable to grasp a concept. \n\nThe problem I am running into is I don't want my career to become stagnant by staying in one position too long but there is no room for upward mobility with the NOC unless the director leaves and I can't see that happening anytime soon. My fear is that I take a position outside of a ITSM Leadership position (Manager or higher) and I end up in the same position as I was before, overwhelmed and out of my element, either at my current company or at another company in this economy. \n\nSuggestions?

        "content": "Hey folk. I am a really passionate technologist as I like to say. That's one of the things I tell people when people ask what I do in a professional context. At it's true, my family got their first PC when I was in 3rd grade which was a 486sx 33 mhz if anyone's interested. Ever since then I know I was going to make technology my career. When I was 17 I walked into a mom and pop PC repair place and asked if they could use any help. He asked if I could look at a couple of machines he had in for repair, and I did and apparently I did well enough for him which kicked off my career. Worked for local companies until I was 22 and then I got on at a large data-center company which also provided Managed Services. This was before the massive influx of MSPs that we see today. Just turned 40 this year so this marks 18 years in the MSP world and I joke that I've done pretty much every job there is. Three 3 levels of engineering, Technical Operations Management,  Technology Advisor, and Solution Engineering and Architecture, and then back to Sr Management. \n\nDuring my time I've been in an industry where many folks in leadership and sales have done very well between bonus for bringing in large customers and things like that. I've always been adjacent to that success but always a day late and a dollar short of being able to be a part of that success myself. Now that's not to say I haven't been successful. I am, in some ways I'm lucky to be a guy who literally never went to college. I went from making minimum wage at that first mom and pop computer shop to approaching 180k combined salary and bonus. But some of these guys walked away with millions, and having been exposed that I can't help thinking that it's in my grasp. \n\nMy current company which I've been at for 4 years. quite frankly is a massive shit show. No amount of telling you that could prepare you for the amount of internal politics and dysfunction. I was in a TAM/Client Advisor type role, at a time when operations was be aggressively outsourced to India after we made a client commitment to reduce costs to out largest client which completely fell on it's face. In a short time I established myself really well with the client. I won't go into detail, but I took ownership with improving the quality of service by working directly with engineers and building the relationship with the client. Everyone in the company knows me all the way up to the CEO as the guy that has our largest client locked down. We haven't solved all of our problems mind you, but we improved  the relationship. Partly based on restructuring that I recommended, which was a hybrid between the original fully onshore model, and the intended fully offshore model. They completely redefined my role moved me into operations to have all the subject matter experts for each technology report to me. Which is 16 people onshore people. Then then India leaders also dotted line into me for a total of around 100 people who ultimately I set the pace for. During that period and since then my Sr Director, and VP basically stated to me that we wanted to restructure other clients to match what we had done for our largest and they wanted me to help scale the new organization we had built since it had been very successful. Expectations were also set that I would be my Directors clear successor. \n\nSome time passed and some progress had been made in this area, but then the large client had new leadership come in. Me and my Sr. Director did a really good job establishing relationships with the new leadership, but after some badly timed outages combined with politics my boss the Sr Director was asked to be removed and replaced. They also stated that while they were really happy with me they felt I was a single point of failure as well as members of my team because we have been struggling to get the offshore folks to really step up. It was an unnecessary change as the issues that were experienced were due to bad decisions made on the client side. But, we give the client what they want regardless of it makes sense. Instead of the original plan of my being moved up to take my bosses place, my VP brought a new person in. This is in the last few months. I'm not a fan of the new person. Instead of doing a better job then my boss, he is basically getting into the weeds of what I do which the client did not have a problem with. I almost feel like he's doing half my job. Meanwhile i've always been told that I need to delegate more, which I've been successful doing as part of my previous bosses plans to promote me  , but between me delegating down, and my new boss taking over other things it leaves me with little to do, except that when my boss excludes me things become a shit show that I am inevitable brought in to fix. I felt like this organization had turned into a dead end for me because my customer and my leadership felt I was too important in my current role.  \n\nSo I applied for a Director position in a different part of the company. I was literally a shoe in for the position and everyone I work with advocated for me to be put into the role. But, when I informed my current leadership of my plan which is required by HR things really went sideways. My VP, went to the COO of the company,  presented a case that I was both unqualified for the role I applied for, as well as so critical in my current role that I shouldn't be considered. We are owned by a private equity firm, and it was specifically said, that leadership's equity could be at risk if something bad happens to the large client which. I only know this because of a confidential informant. Meanwhile one of the reasons I was aggressively pursuing a Director role was the ability to build equity and actually really profit on the work I was putting in like an investor would.  To me  my VP stating to my COO that I was unqualified was the most egregious thing that anyone could have done, and it broke any sort of trust I had remaining. \n\nI'm at a point where I'm looking, but how many times and I gonna be so close and yet so far. I've started going down youtube rabbit holes on building my own business, or acquiring existing small businesses. I even looked at some smaller businesses for sale. A small MSP, a fire and flood restoration business, which is the type of business my fathers in, a local theater for sale in my town, even things like vending machine routes. I feel desperate to make changes to where I feel in more control. \n\nThis is really just a rant. But, curious on what feedback I would receive. \n\n&#x200B;",

You said you are well known up to the CEO; if that's true then take your case directly to them.\n\nYou want a promotion to director, if they really value you, then they'll make it happen, either to the new department or the current department. Losing good employees suck. Losing exceptional employees, especially in management and leadership, is even worse. Show them you're dissatisfied and what it takes to make you satisfy. They'll make it happen, if not, then you know you gave it a shot and you can start unwinding down your work and exploring other opportunities.",

Word it correctly, you will have your pick of other companies.\n\nMy rant companies for too long have taken a lend of really good tech personal holding back their potential. This seem to be the case here. However its easy for me to say move. Its your role your risk moving, prepare for a lean time aim for the progression you deserve. \n\nBest of luck.",
            "I find it hard to get a clear sense of what you want, what you really care about, and what you're concerned about.  So the idea is that you want to be a director because directors get equity, but they said you shouldn't be because you're so important in your current role that the company is in jeopardy if you leave that role?\n\nIf so, then maybe see if you can get equity by virtue of being so important and indispensable in your current role...?\n\nProbably not, but it's funny that they've kind of talked themselves into that corner.  I'd bet that as soon as you're asking for a raise of any kind, you'll suddenly become \"not that important\".\n\nBut in general, just as an FYI, a lot of companies these days avoid promoting from within, and when you want a promotion, you need to find a different job.  One of the reasons for that is that, if you're bad at your current job, then they don't want to promote you because you're bad, but if you're great at your current job, they don't want to promote you because then they'll need to find someone just as good to promote you.\n\nAlso, a lot of companies, especially if they're bigger or more serious companies, see a gulf between \"upper management\" the \"workers\", and they don't particularly like people crossing that chasm.  I think some of it's just ego and bias, that the upper management think of themselves as special humans who deserve more than normal people, and if a normal person can successfully make the jump to be one of them, it challenges that idea.\n\nSo again, if you want a good promotion, you might need to jump ship to another company."

            "Context: I\u2019m a director. I used to be \u201cthe guy\u201d that everyone came to for answers on tech problems. I did helpdesk, sysadmin, server admin, network admin, and cybersecurity roles before pivoting into leadership. \n\nI am no longer \u201cthe guy\u201d that people come to for tech answers, I\u2019m the person they come to when a decision needs to be made or something needs to be resolved. Instead of doing tickets and solving technical puzzles all day, I do (admittedly a small amount) of paperwork, and spend the rest of my days either doing project management, or keeping up with my team and their work. I listen to them, and seek opportunities to set them up for success, both at work and in their careers. I spend a lot of time listening to my team and giving recommendations on my experience, and if they bring up something I don\u2019t know about I take a note of it and make sure I learn about it before I leave the office that day. \n\nOverall, my job is investing in my team, setting them up for success both at our organization and for their next role wherever and whatever that may be. Beyond that, is the part that I believe anyone can do: it\u2019s just project management, vendor management, paperwork, planning, etc., all the stuff someone with a little bit of drive and organization skills can handle. The most difficult part of the whole job is actually investing on a full-send level into your team. If you\u2019re a people person, that might be beneficial to you for sure. \n\nPivoting into management after 1 year could be good for you if you weren\u2019t sure where you\u2019d want to specialize because you can just slowly work on building a base understanding about the things your team will be working on because as an IT manager it isn\u2019t your job to be doing the work, it\u2019s your job to be informed enough to be able to make decisions when the time comes, which is very different. \n\nIf you had hopes on developing a more technical career first before transitioning into leadership, I highly recommend that. Unless this management role comes with a really good bump in pay, and it\u2019s something you really want to do and the description of what my day looks like sounds like how you wouldn\u2019t mind spending your day, I would advise you politely decline the opportunity and ensure them that you may be interested down the line but you prefer to get more technical experience first. Nothing wrong with that. As you said, you\u2019re young, so you have time on your side.",

You're going to have to deal with or ignore some sexist rumor-mill stuff, especially if you are being promoted while highly technical and more experienced people are not (even if that's because they entirely lack soft skills). You love your job now - will these social issues make you hate it?\n\nThis will set a trajectory for you. You're already not highly technical, and taking a management role will hinder your ability to grow technically. Evaluate your career goals - your future growth will be limited if you are a non-technical technical manager. If you're content with your role, and feel good about opportunities for less technical managers in your specific subdomain, then this can be fine.

Many people have a deep-seeded beliefs about women in stem, and they make unfair assumptions about how you got into your position.  And the only way to handle these people is to shut them down with your superior knowledge and skillset. So the first few years, I worked 12 hour days and studied and learned every waking minute.   \nAll that hard work lead me to become an expert in my industry, and I've gone on to be the highest ranking IT leader at several other organizations before eventually finishing a Masters in Software Engineering and moving into Dev roles. I've been in this industry for 24 years, and I can tell you that it's an uphill battle the whole way. Your resume will get rejected by 90% of companies for just having a female name. You will have to take jobs no one else wants in companies and departments circling the drain, because you won't be considered for the prime picks. And you will have to accept salary offers that are 30% lower than what would be offered to a man with your same qualifications. \n\nAnd being able to put \"IT Manager\" on your resume is the first step in improving that outcome.

I've seen this time and time again where new people on the customer side come in and think they know how to solve problems, but don't truly want to take on the challenges that need to be taken in to really solve the problem.

Pace was super fast at first (on par with my MSP experience), and now is super slow now that I've fixed a lot of the common issues. I've since filled the time with research and operational tasks. Coming from an MSP background, my inclination was to work with the existing MSP as best as possible and preserve those relationships rather than the hostile approach I've seen internal Sysadmins take. \n\nThe stuff MSP sucks at (That you can do better), take off their plate and deliver this yourself. It can be difficult to make your work as an IT personnel \"visible\" to your laymen boss and peers, so use every opportunity like this that you can in order to build confidence and trust. The MSP is probably doing something right if they've maintained this relationship for so long.

            "So some things I would suggest before taking on this kind of role\n\n* Do you have management experience, if not will some one in upper management be there to mentor you?\n* Do you have sales/purchasing experience, have you ever negotiated large contracts with vendors or on behalf of vendors?\n* What kind of authority will you be given to run your department, will you be able to propose a budget and be given a free hand, or will you have to justify every expense, Do you know how to do a budget? do you know how to manage operation expenses or Capital expenses?\n* How does the company's upper management culture see IT, Is it purely a cost center, a profit center, a risk management and productivity engine, or something else?  How the business see's IT will determine how the department is treated.\n* How does the business's future strategy include tech and IT?\n* How will IT resources justify themselves, how will IT projects be measured for success or failure, how will IT priorities be weighted against business priorities.\n* Do you fall under a CTO, a COO, or a CFO.  If you fall under a CFO you are probably considered an expense by the business, if you fall under a COO you are probably considered critical to the operations of the business, if you fall under a CTO then the business is starting to consider tech as part of their business strategy.\n\nFinally, keep in mind a director is a management role, its going to have very little overlap with your sysadmin role - you will need the tech experience to help develop strategy and policy, but you will NOT be implementing your policy, instead you will be hiring the right sysadmins or MSP's to help enact that policy.  I've seen some Sysadmin roles where you had to negotiate software or partner contracts, but that will be a much bigger part of your role.  You might still be the key player in planning a major system upgrade, but especially as you learn to trust the people under you as Subject matter Experts, you should be less and less involved in the details, so you can focus on solving the next hair on fire problem for the business.  \n\nSome people really don't like that kind of mindset, and don't enjoy the accounting, the reports or the people management, and want to focus on the details of the big cool projects - but that way often leads towards micromanagement and a bad department so if you think this is you - its probably best to stay out of a manager role and instead ask for more responsibility as a System Architect or some elevated sysadmin role allowing you to advise the manager they eventually hire.",

        "content": "Hi everyone.\n\nI am a relatively new IT manager - actually hit my 1 year today! \n\nI'm an IT hobbyist and passionate about technology. My interest in the field is primarily helping end users and making decisions that I feel best increase security and productivity. In simple words, I make common sense decisions for a staff that isn't really technologically sound. In this position I've led and supervised a staff for the first time. I love it and enjoy bringing everyone up to the same level of proficiency. I've also got to utilize firewalls, network/VLAN, and budgets frequently. My past was tier 3 IT support for a couple of years. \n\nDue to events in both my personal life and work place, I am looking for new employment. I always thought I'd be an IT manager for a number of years before moving up to Senior or Director. It's clear that's not going to happen at my company. I feel that I haven't been in this position long enough for a new company to put their full trust in me (though I've been applying!) - so I was curious how you all felt about taking a lateral step, or perhaps a step back into a role that by chance pays MORE with a hybrid/WFH benefit.\n\nI've been on this sub for a year now and whenever those \"What do you make?\" questions pop up, it's apparent that I am underpaid at my position, approx. $88k/yr. And job searching in my area has revealed to me that I could make more as an IT Analyst, LAN Administrator, etc than I currently do as a manager. I am also concerned that by relinquishing my title, should I move up in the future, my manager experience on a resume might not carry as much weight.\n\nI am curious if anyone had made a similar transition. Thanks! ",

            "First, decide if not being technical anymore is what you really want to do. If you move to any company of size as a real director (and above), you'll be dealing with people, politics and numbers. You will likely not be hands on anymore. Jumping to a technical job just for the pay will not be a wise move IMO. Yes it's leaving money on the table but you need to look at long term goals. Assuming you are OK with not being technical, look for another management job that's a step up. (eg: more direct reports and users, some complexity, etc) I think you'll need some more time as a manager before trying to climb but you could get lucky. I also recommend you get management training.

            "Congrats on your first year! To address your question: there's nothing wrong with pursuing a new position that fulfills you/serves you more! Having a year of being a manager on your resume is something that potential employers will look favorably upon, so don't fret, be confident in your applications and interviews. I have heard that jumping every 2-3 years is the sweet spot, but that doesn't mean you won't be considered at other companies. It sounds like you truly enjoy leading by example and helping your org succeed. I would harp on that in your interviews.\n\nIf you want to keep moving up in the field, I would definitely recommend a lateral move instead of a step back/down. Unless that \"step down\" is at a Fortune 500 company or a company larger than your current one where you'll likely be responsible for more than you would be as a manager at a smaller company. I'm just curious, what makes it clear that you're not going to move up at your company?\n\nI made a semi-similar move 4.5 years ago when I was at an MSP. I was solid at the job, but it was clear that there was no room for growth since the company wasn't growing in a way that required a role that existed above mine. It was basically us grunts in the SOC/NOC and then the owners. So I went to work at one of my clients as their IT Manager when the role became available.\n\n  \nMaybe these specifics about my position/comp will help you in your job search. 9 years experience in IT, 4.5 years as a manager. Company of 75 users, and 1 direct report. I'm effectively their IT director since I set the strategy for cybersecurity, technology investments, implementation, networking, etc. and also report directly to #2 in the company. I also oversee IT support and jump into the helpdesk when needed. Lots of hats. I have my CISSP cert along with Network+. I get paid $110,000/yr, 95% remote other than the 5-8 times a year I'm traveling to one of our offices.\n\n  \nCould I make more money somewhere else? I'm sure I could, but I feel valued and feel that I'll continue to grow where I'm at. I'm confident about the growth, but if that outlook changes, I'll certainly be looking for something else like you are\n\n  \nTreat yourself like a business, and make the best business decision for yourself. It sounds like you genuinely care and are giving good work to the place you're at. It's time to do what's right for you.",

Prioritize yourself and family and see what is out there!",
            "I was a IT Director for about 6 years at my previous place and got hit by layoffs. The new job I landed was a step down from a director role and is just a manager role. Pay is less, I made less base pay as a director but got nice bonuses that pushed me to like 140k annual. This manager role I make base pay of 120k with no bonus. \n\nMy new role, the work life balance is 100x better. Also job security is 100x better which was an important factor in my search. I also went from full remote to hybrid. I dont mind being back in an office and my commute isnt bad. But the nice thing is I rarely look at my work phone out of standard 7-4 business hours. \n\nSo it's had its pluses and minuses but overall I'm fairly happy with the \"step back\" in a sense. There are parts of being a director I do miss, and some of the musles I used to flex as a director I dont get to use as much as a manager now.",

Of course this depends on a lot of factors like years of experience, education, region. You may want to do additional research in any case. Of course you're not going to make that kind of money with 1 year of experience, senior positions are usually 8-10 years in at minimum. AFAIK, Analysts and Administrators make less.",
            "It's a pretty common path to bounce between manager/team lead a couple times looking for the right fit. I think i was IC -> Team lead in 3 roles before going IC -> Manager -> Director.  \n\nI think you have a reasonable story to explain what you're doing to prospective employers. It's easy to frame your experience as someone with a solid hands on skillset with the drive and interest to move into more leadership.",
            "It's very interesting, as all roles. IT manager is incredibly general, I know IT managers who earn 300k+ and hold responsibility over 10,000+ devices/servers across the country. Where as I for example earn significantly less with a umbrella of about 350.\n\nOne thing to note, is that IT manager isn't always a more senior position than engineer/admin roles. and being an IT manager doesn't guarantee you access to senior engineering roles where the big money is.\n\n1 year is not a long time for companies to be throwing promotions at you either. You need to learn your craft first and demonstrate you are working at a Director level.",

Previously, I was a Project Manager for 4 years where I felt confident in my role. I took this new role for the challenge and growth opportunities, but I\u2019m currently feeling lost and regretting my decision.\n\nEven though I have a background in software engineering, I'm now tasked with responsibilities like creating infrastructure and architecture diagrams (without any architects or infrastructure team in the organization, just devs and QA), and reviewing source code (something I haven't done in years). These technical tasks are new to me, and they\u2019re taking a lot of time to learn and complete, which has left several of my other responsibilities unaddressed. Despite my efforts to solve these technical issues, I haven\u2019t been able to resolve anything.\n\nIn meetings, both technical and with users, I often feel out of my depth and it's been affecting my confidence. I feel like an idiot because I\u2019ve been asked technical questions in meetings that I couldn\u2019t answer. My boss has become distant and today didn\u2019t speak to me at all, even delegating a meeting With the staff to a developer who reports to me. I\u2019ve never faced such professional challenges before \u2013 I have 7 years of experience, have never quit from a job, and have never been fired. This situation has been affecting my sleep and overall well-being. (In this short time, I\u2019ve gained weight).\n\nI had definitely become accustomed to project management (I\u2019m PMP certified) and had forgotten to stay involved in the technical side of things. I started my career as a QA, then moved to a Agile team Lead, and spent the last 4 years as a Project Manager.\n\nI\u2019m seriously considering resigning now and returning to PM role where I felt more competent and secure. Has anyone else experienced something similar? Should I quit now?\n\nThanks for any advice or support.\n\nTL;DR: I know I'm partly to blame for accepting this role, as is my boss for offering it, but I never expected to be so heavily involved in technical tasks. I thought it would be more of a management role. These tasks are further complicated by the lack of documentation. Right now, I feel more outside the organization than inside; my mind no longer feels part of this. In conclusion, I only think about resigning. Should I do it now or not?\n",

I felt the need to learn to code to justify myself to my team. \n\nI\u2019m 3 and a bit years in and was since promoted to Director and also given a QA and architecture team.  I still don\u2019t know too much about the weeds of coding, but, I have to remind myself, that\u2019s not my job. \n\nYou say you\u2019ve been tasked to do code reviews? By who?

You\u2019re there manager, and good managers need those PM skills because those are often areas Devs and QA are less strong in. \n\nDo you have job families with career progression for your devs? Do you have a lead? Would anyone be able to have stretch goals to level up and help with code reviews or put diagrams together? Would someone be interested in devops and infrastructure? Could you motivate the team to want to do that because the vision and ideas you have? Do you have budget and opportunity to temporary contract for any gaps you\u2019re seeing? Is there an offset you can you find to afford that? \n\nIf I was your boss I wouldn\u2019t care so much on who does code reviews or drafts the diagrams, as long as the team is performing well and continuing to improve and deliver.  So focus on rapport, being a sponge, and putting some PM creativity into problem solving these gaps.

Then it might be a good fit.\n\nA couple of things I found difficult to get used to: Don't assume people will just do what you ask them to or translate expectations into the right outcomes easily, that can require a lot of work. And management can be quite lonely... this may depend on your situation, but I have a large team so I have to keep a professional distance, and my peers on the management level are doing very different things and are also quite a bit older than I am, so it is harder to find a group to hang with and vent (at least inside the company).",

            "I did this many years ago. It was hard because it was a catch 22. They want managerial experience but u don\u2019t have it. But in order to get it someone needs to give u a shot. So either rise through the ranks at ur current places or get lucky outside. I got lucky so it is possible. Life is short and do what motivates u and makes u happy. GL OP.",
            "I am going through the same thing and appreciate the discussion. Going from a large organization (3,500 users) to a small for-profit company with 150 users. I am going to be one of those technical managers with a part-time tech and an MSP that is currently running the show (and probably not thrilled that I am coming on board).\n\nWould love to hear how others have transitioned as it has been a while since I managed others full time. I appreciate the muscle memory comment already."

        "content": "Hello Everyone,\n\nI'm currently aiming to transition from a technical role to leading an IT department. My journey started on the service desk, and I worked my way up to lead a small IT support team. This role sparked my interest in business strategy and continuous improvement, but I left that role to enhance my technical skills and currently a Sys/Net Admin. Despite achieving this, I find that I am no longer challenged by purely technical work. Instead, I am drawn to the aspects of leading high-performing teams and spearheading process improvements.\n\nMy goal is to leverage my experience to lead business initiatives and build strong teams. I am updating my resume and cover letter to reflect this shift in focus from technical expertise to management capabilities, though I recognize the competition is formidable.\n\nTo better prepare myself, I have started listening to the \"Manager Tools\" podcast and am considering an MBA, although I typically prioritize practical skills over formal education. From a technical standpoint, I hold a BS in a technical field and certifications including CCNA, MCSA, ITIL, AWS, and CompTIA. I\u2019m contemplating the idea of getting a PMP and CISSP certifications as they frequently appear in job descriptions for managerial roles.\n\nI would appreciate any recommendations on training programs, books, or any resources that would aid my transition. Moreover, if you've made a similar move, what steps did you take? What advice would you offer based on your experience?\n\nThank you in advance for your guidance and insights!\n\nEdit: Thank you for such great feedback. I have started the book \"How to win friends and influence people\" and added others to my wish list. I seek mentorship from my favorite leader. I also understand that i will need to shift my paradigm from IC to Leader and learn to step away from technical to be a sucessful and leading a team of engineers. ",

            "I am in the same boat always been an IC and although led many projects and teams and initiatives am finding it hard to make it sound worthwhile to a prospective employer, the other negative is I never pursued a degree, which is a pain right now, and I'll be honest, I am too old to consider the cost vs benefit unless it is a total last resort, I'll be fair looking at the material some of my team are doing I doubt I would be able to complete it anyway!\n\nCurrently I am forging a path as a Sr engineer but really focusing on the admin and people side, which means being stuck in all the meetings amd 1:1s my manager doesn't want to attend lol.\n\nThe hardest thing for a tech person, and I have heard this from a number of mentors I have had, is letting go.\n\nYou are not the \"doer\" anymore, you utilise your teams strengths and trust them as SMEs, you are the one that removes the blocks and issues, and occasionally uses your experience (and hopefully better people skills) to guide them if they are struggling or losing direction, it's quite hard to let go, sometimes impossible for some.\n\nAs a leader, even an IC leader, you should be totally approachable for any issue and also have the ability to \"see around corners\" for any potential bumps along the way and prepare for them.\n\nIn many ways it is unenviable since you still have a direct manager, whom you may not agree with all the time, and sometimes you do have to have the upward direction \"difficult conversation\" with them.\n\nIf your manager is any good, and knows your goals they will be receptive, supportive and sometime appreciate the differences, other times it is just disagree and commit, you can deep dive and compile lessons learned after the immediate  issue/project is sorted (even if you disagree and are overruled if you stated your reasons correctly and politely, a decent manager will return to that and be more likely to listen if there is a next or similar situation, and most importantly your peers/team will give you a lot more respect and support if they know you were in their corner, that is currency you cannot buy anywhere for any price)\n\nThat's 2 cents! good luck",

            "I took a more technical path and focused on small businesses which gave me opportunities to grow and advance.  \n\nLooking back, I\u2019d say the best advice is to network.   I found a lot of networking happens at training classes (in person if possible), or conferences (especially if you can get to local ones).   But find local organizations to join or interact with, get an opportunity to speak at one if possible.  Develop some knowledge in a niche (I went cybersecurity) and publish articles, follow authors and speakers and help promote them.  Being in a niche (like, social engineering as a more specific subsection) allows you to keep up with trends and develop a network.\n\nWhen you get in a company you see as an opportunity, be respectful and helpful to everyone - especially those under your level as you move up.  These relationships will accomplish the work that you\u2019re no longer going to be doing yourself when you ascend.   If you don\u2019t treat them well when you\u2019re not above them, you can only expect pushback and trouble when you are.  For me, servant leadership was easy.  If it\u2019s not for you, make sure you\u2019re aware of how you\u2019re perceived by the people you rely on.   If you nurture these relationships well, you will be able to delegate accountability in addition to responsibility and sleep better.  \n\nAlso, the real trick to moving up is having someone capable and trustworthy of filling your role so you can focus on your new, more important, role.  Identify and mentee a good worker early on, and they\u2019ll push you up in the way you should be pushing your boss up and making their life easier as you rise.",
            "I think you are well on your way and shouldn't have any problems. You seem to know what you want and very focused on that.  I'd say just keep doing what you are doing, and I think it will be a great transition for you!! Best of luck!",

I've enjoyed reading other's experiences and the good/bad/funny stories that came along. I made my last post in this sub about a year ago and y'all we're nothing short of being helpful. Anyways, here comes another post. I mainly looking for a motivator and just want to vent a little. I am open to everyone's opinion. \n\nI recently hit my two year anniversary. The last two years hasn't really been good or bad for me. I am fully remote (very blessed to do that even to this day) but I do lack the human interaction element that makes me feel like I am a valuable member of the team. I told myself I need to ask for more to do and continue to learn but every time I ask my manager, I don't feel like he is trying to groom me to further my career. With that feeling inside, I told myself to take advantage of the \"free\" time I have and start studying. I contemplated between going either the cybersecurity or cloud computing route. We worked closely with the IT Security team and it made me realized I rather go into cloud instead.\n\nSo I am having a tough time trying to break down the wall to be trusted to do more things at work. My manager left a comment in my review saying he wants me to be more assertive. I thought asking for more to do and more to learn will fulfill that but somehow I ended up getting the thumbs down when I ask for more access to the main tools we use. We do have a guy that work on the backend but I'm not sure why these guys don't want to teach. Maybe it's for job security?\n\nWhat other methods should I take at this point in hopes to get more responsibilities? My goal ultimately is to learn more about things in the backend and hopefully transition into something else on another team. There are days when I am feeling a bit lost. Should I ask for more or should I just lay low, study and get out? It kinda sucks how the job market is going at the moment. So picking up and leave w/ a family to support isn't really an option.\n\nAnyways, thank you for reading.",

            "Generally speaking, lack of upward mobility is a big red flag. You're not given opportunities to take on more responsibilities, you're not being taught how to be better, you don't have a mentor, and you're not being supported in your educational pursuits.\n\nThis is usually a sign that they don't value you and or they don't have the money to develop their team. Either of these is a sign to plan your exit strategy.\n\nBUT. You need to do some self assessment. What you're asking for from your manager; is it in alignment with your team's vision? Forget the other teams, they have no vested reason to see you grow. Focus on who you report to, and what his vision is. If you're activities aren't helping him achieve that goal, that maybe that's why he has no motivation to help you. Whatever request you're making, you need to frame it as a win-win. If you've done that and you're still not getting anywhere, there's a few possibilities: he genuinely doesn't feel you're an asset, or he has no authority to authorize what you're asking for (and is reluctant to ask for permission). In the latter case, you might want to consider going above him but you want to be careful about the approach and not leave your manager out of the loop. If you succeed in getting what you want, you need to show gratitude and give credit to him as well.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind that in a larger organization, there's a lot more compartmentalization and you're expected to stay in your wheelhouse. Asking for greater influence and control over things outside your wheelhouse will get you no where, probably go against the culture, and annoy people. If that's not your thing you might be better off in a smaller shop where you have more freedom and control.",

It would benefit you to start in a an analyst role so you can actually see what it\u2019s like doing the job and what your team would go through and work your way toward a management role you will have greater empathy and ability to understand the pain points for your team. \n\nMy best advice to someone coming out of the military is don\u2019t be a hard ass, ass hole, or extremely strict to the point of where you can only see things in black and white. The worst managers I\u2019ve worked with as a manager myself seemed to have all come out of some branch of the military and they all have super black and white views of the world and problem solving. Are hard nosed and tend to make employees underneath them miserable while sitting in their ivory tower proclaiming how much everyone below them loves them with delusions of grandeur. I\u2019m telling you this bluntly because I can. \n\nBe empathetic and listen to your people. Most civilians do not have military mindsets. The new generation wants to clock and and clock off when the day is over. Appreciate your achievers, but don\u2019t expect your entire team to care as much as your top performers do. Help develop them. Don\u2019t talk at them listen to them and talk with them. Be willing to admit your wrong. Be willing to admit your management approach is wrong and accept feedback and be willing to be flexible and change for the better. Don\u2019t bend over to your managers just because they are the authority. fight for your team when it makes sense. \n\nI really really dislike the \u201cit\u2019s my way or the highway\u201d Attitude so many leaders in the civilian world coming from the military have and it tends to create incredibly toxic work cultures. It\u2019s not all military leaders that I see this with but it is a vast majority and I\u2019m fairly certain the reason is that they try to translate the toxic work culture that they\u2019ve been raised in the military into civilian life.

You will learn what it's like as a non-manager. If you truly have leadership skills, you will excel and move up the ladder quickly to increase that paycheck. \n\nIf you didn't \"retire\" and need a really good paycheck to maintain your current lifestyle, look for Project Manager roles with tech. Specifically around cybersecurity due to your internship background.  Cybersecurity is hot and pays well too. As a PM, you can get an idea if you want to go the technical route to become analyst or engineer. Or you can decide if you want to go the leadership route. You could also just stick with being a PM. PMs make really good money too in large enterprises. \n\nKnock that PMP cert out as that plus your education and current experience is the key to opening doors right now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo specifically answer your questions:\n\n*Does my background/CV make sense for an immediate transition to IT Management?* Not really but it's possible. Just depends on what the company is looking for. If they need a leader that isn't that technical, yes. If they need a technical manager, no. \r  \n \r  \n*Would it be beneficial to obtain my CCNA or PMP certifications?*  Yes, Increasing your education is always beneficial. As to how beneficial, it depends on the job you want. \r  \n\r  \n*Do I need to earn an MBA or M.S. in IT to break into this role?* No, you don't need it. If you want to become a senior leader in IT(Director/VP/CIO/CTO), it would be extremely helpful to have a higher level degree. Maybe wait until you get some civilian experience under your belt before you decide to do this. I believe you will have 15 years to use your Post 9/11 GI Bill. You have plenty of time to decide. BTW...That is IMO the best benefit of the military. You get housing allowance, book allowance, and tuition(to a limit) paid for. USE IT! \r  \n\r  \n*Is it a requirement to gain experience as a Help Desk / IT Analyst?* No, but it would be extremely helpful. You would have a better understanding of what your direct reports are dealing with*.* \n\nAlso, u/sonofalando is also right about the \"it's my way or the highway\" attitude. Non-military people don't respond well to this at all. Barking orders will actually have the opposite affect in the civilian world. I'm a veteran and always hated the military approach.

To them it\u2019s all \u201cmagic\u201d so they expect everything to be done immediately. You should spend most of your time communicating with your team and actually listening to them when they tell you that a project everyone else thinks is \u201csimple\u201d and \u201cshould be quick\u201d is actually a year-long project.\n\nThe idea that you can just yell louder to make things happen faster is completely wrong and will have the opposite effect.

Planning to shift to Exchange 2019 next.\n* **Current Setup:** All mailboxes are cloud-based except one used for SQL jobs and EDI software. We also use Mimecast for enhanced email security.\n* **Infrastructure:** No plans to keep Exchange on-prem long-term, but concerned about the impact on our domain. Our Forest Functional Level (FFL) is at 2012 R2. We primarily use internal domain controllers with Kerberos authentication. The remaining on-prem systems include LAN shares and AX2012.\n* **Device Management:** Moving towards hybrid joining all company devices. Currently, resolving conflicts between MDM and Group Policy.\n* **Remote Management:** Increasingly challenging as our user base grows (1,000+ users, 600 added in the last four years). I can manage nearly everything from my phone except for Active Directory tasks, which forces me to use RDP to a VM when mobile.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Has anyone upgraded from Exchange 2016 to 2019 recently? How did it go?\n2. Has anyone transitioned from a hybrid to a fully cloud-based environment? What were the key challenges and benefits?\n3. Any experiences upgrading AD FFL to 2016? What should I watch out for?\n4.

My boss (IT Director) was planning on leaving in January 2024 and was planning on having a replacement all figured out this August allowing for some overlap to properly hand off workload.\n\nI was being groomed for the position. Recently though he announced that he would be staying on for another 3 years. I'm happy for him, as he was retiring early (were fairly close) but I'm disappointed because this affects my professional growth plans.\n\nI'm 46 and after being in the same position for 6 years I think now is a good time to make a move. I'm starting to look at new job opportunities using the typical job boards (Linkedin, etc). I've never worked with a recruiter before, would a recruiter be able to help me find a good employer to work for? I've generally just heard horror.\n\nAs an IT Manager what are methods that worked for you to find potential employers?",
        "comments": [
            "Do you have your LinkedIn set to where only recruiters can see you\u2019re looking for jobs? I\u2019d definitely make sure that setting is on and configured right to your desired locations and titles.\n\nAlso make sure everything on your LinkedIn is cleaned up, nice pic, simple professional headline, jobs and descriptions, certs, degrees.\n\nIf you have both of that you should be getting regular messages from recruiters about positions. Usually they\u2019ll come to you, especially if you\u2019re at a company is name recognition unless you\u2019re just in a niche market",
            "I\u2019m not an IT manager, but I think the answer is similar for any industry so here\u2019s my two cents.\n\nCommenting on your situation first, it sounds like you\u2019re in a perfect spot to look to move on and your motivations for doing so will be v desirable to recruiters/hiring mangers. This will make your life much easier.\n\nAnswering your first question, broadly speaking, yes. Think of a good recruiter like a good estate agent. You can approach them with your situation, they should ask good questions to understand exactly what you want, then their job is to find a perfect match. They can use the connections they have, and their experience in the market, to filter through unsuitable roles on your behalf, which can help your job search feel much smoother.\n\nMost people have negative opinions on recruiters because they\u2019ve only worked with bad ones. My advice (and answer to your second question) would be to find a reputable recruiter to work with before you do anything else (updating CV, setting open to work, applying directly etc.). A conversation with a good recruiter will help nail down exactly what you\u2019re looking for and give you tons of ammunition for interviews and profile building later down the line.\n\nI\u2019d suggest an actionable first step of identifying 3 recruiters who would be worth talking to. You can find credible recruiters on LinkedIn. Some filter suggestions might be 4+ years experience, industry specific, location, time at current company, etc. \n\nOnce you\u2019ve found your 3 on paper, set an hour with each to talk, after which I\u2019m confident you\u2019ll have a strong plan for your next steps. Good luck!",
            "LinkedIn is the current standard. Updating everything and then making yourself available in the settings will open you up to searches by individuals and corporate recruiters. There was a time when headhunters were valuable, but I think they are mostly obsolete. Run your own searches and apply to interesting jobs, but you\u2019ll most likely be found by other people searching for you. Expect a minimum of three months and maximum of six. If you don\u2019t have anything within six months, the economy is terrible or you are doing something wrong with your presentation of yourself. Be picky. Don\u2019t select the first role unless it is amazing. With 20 years of IT experience and six years in management, you are valuable. Act like it. Good luck.",
            "The people management doesn't change. But the budget and state of the infrastructure can be a shock to your sense of what is acceptable. It never ceases to amaze me with what some IT professionals choose to ignore unless they are forced to address. As the IT Director, it's your job to make sure the technical infrastructure is secure and also appropriately supports the organization now and for future growth. \n\nIf you're serious, and this is you following the desires of your heart, then move forward as long as the family (wife) understands your motivation. Share the journey with your wife. She will help you to identify blindspots that you've never thought of.\n\nGet your money and get the title. Be ready to grow. It's painful but also very rewarding. \n\nBest of luck!",
            "Recruiters are often pretty useless, but if you somehow find a good one, they really can help find good positions, and also help coach you through the whole process.\n\nI don't really know how to find a good recruiter.  If you have a good LinkedIn page and set it to indicate that you're looking for work, a bunch of recruiters will contact you.\n\nI recommend talking to any recruiter that reaches out, and seeing how it goes.  If they seem awful and unhelpful, stop talking to them.  If they seem helpful, keep talking to them.",

Make sure your resume speaks to management value added (e.g., people and projects managed, budgets juggled, migrations, and SLAs).\n\nPerhaps take a class at a local college to gain access to their placement services.\n\nTake your boss out for drinks, cake, soda, tea, something to get off the reservation and ask about what he would do in your situation?  Explain how you are happy to keep him around, but concerned about your career and all.",

            "It is worth if it you love networking and enjoy it. \n\nThere are still plenty of roles and will be for a while, but I'd say there is a general downtrend in the \"traditional network engineer\" role, as businesses shift to cloud, SDN and network automation, which all leads to a drop in headcount of IT inhouse staff.\n\nI would say there is more opportunity \"in general\" for coding related roles as that is a skill set with a large cross-over. As you already are able to code that might be something to consider.\n\nYou could also combine the two and look towards becoming a network automation engineer.\n\nA lot of network roles now require some form of automation experience or ability to code as well, so your current skill set will be of good use to you in a networking field.",

Your current ability could get you a position in a tech high school, today, possibly. They are in need of science and math people also, and with electrical engineering you had Todo lots of that.\n\nMost Academies charge, but their is one I know of called CCNA ninja for serious people. \n\nhttps://www.ccna.ninja/\n\nCisco also has some free offerings.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/m/en_sg/partners/cisco-networking-academy/index.html",

            "Firstly, I'm sorry to hear about the loss of your parent, you're doing a great thing with stable employment so I can empathize that this wouldn't be an easy decision for you.\n\nWith that being said, the best way to progress in your technical role is to certify yourself in a skill with a main vendor - Cisco, Microsoft, AWS, Oracle, etc. These will always be attractive for large firms.\n\nI don't know your personal circumstances, but if you are the focal point for rent and bills, It may be less advantageous of you to drop down into an apprenticeship. My advise would be to keep the role you have now, seek a more senior member of staff and see if you can shadow them. If your role isn't what you want to do long term, spend some time in your down time doing Udemy courses, Networking courses on YouTube, Jeremys Lab is free and highly applauded, and study for the CCNA - This will always be something that gets your foot in the door.\n\nKeep on keeping on."

Know how to read wiring diagrams, Ive traced and repaired full harnesses, Ive installed and programmed modules, used diagnostic tools like scopes and multimeters to watch how various switches and sensors work...etc. the list goes on. Alot of schooling and trial an error has been had during this process. How well will all of this translate in the Resume/interview side? Is this something that will correlate in this field? Systems are different but the principles are the same. I know alot of people want to see experience with things so was curious if this would count towards that or will I have to start at a help desk?

Plus, it's more closely aligned with your skillset already, has the potential to pay better as it's a hotter field with a much larger deficit of qualified people.\n\nEither way, Linux, Python, and Bash/Powershell scripting will be a huge advantage for you going into either field. Neither Linux or Python were traditionally relevant or necessary to Networking a few years ago, but that's changing fast. SD-WAN, and automation/orchestration make Linux environment familiarity, python, and scripting absolutely crucial. \n\nNot knocking network engineering, I did it for most of my adult life. But more and more of every industry including secure gov systems are being rolled into public/private cloud environments, with cloud based virtual networks, and SD-WAN taking over more and more of the network configuration work once handled manually by a ton of Config monkeys like me.\n\nI don't know what particular system you're touching right now, but I'd imagine that like a lot of the systems I've worked on with various gov entities, it's still largely clinging to physical infrastructure. That's not the norm everywhere else, and although the gov is easily the slowest to migrate to cloud and SaaS/PaaS/XaaS environments, they absolutely will. One good VMware pitch about how they'll be able to retire entire floors of server rooms and data centers, and replace them with a few racks of elastic virtual platforms, or offload the hassle entirely to a secure private cloud management company, and they'll make the jump.\n\nWith the new environment, comes a WHOLE LOT of new security headaches though. Meaning fresh blood, more open to cloud security concepts, new compliance models and frameworks, etc.\n\nBe THAT guy!"

            "What is your bachelors in?",
            "If you have 5 years left on your service obligation, I would start with COMTIA Sec+, Net+, etc. You should be able to get vouchers for those exams through the military. After knocking those out, move up to CCENT / CCNA / MCP / MCSA / Linux cert depending what you find interesting as you gain more knowledge through study. Considering the military can pay for your degree through GI Bill / Tuition Assistance, its not going to hurt to start down that path. Many programs available online and provide plenty of hands on learning. My recommendation is to start with certs first, get a good base of knowledge, and then apply to grad school as you transition out of the military. \n\nAlso consider that many National Guard programs will pay tuition and fees for State schools if you decide you want to stay in part time after your service obligation as an officer is up (opportunity to switch to a Signal Corps / Communications field here).",

These days, ccna is generally taught at the associates level, not the masters level. \n\nIf you do federal contracting after your enlistment is up, the degree will carry more weight. Generally speaking, certs are more valuable earlier in your career while education is more important for advancement later in your career. \n\nPersonally, I would tell you to split the difference and get a ccnp. It's basically a masters in networking with more hands-on experience. Better prospects in the job market too. ",

Well I will start this off with a little story I have my MS in an unrelated field (Sociology) I was struggling with this same dilemma myself 20 some odd years ago. I decided to go into Network Engineering and pursued the Cisco route (pun intended) look 20 years to the future and I have a 6 figure job and I am studying for my CCIE Security (failed attempt 1 attempt 2 already scheduled). It was done with all Certs and Experience, also find a good recruiter and get them to help you do your Resume (they know what other recruiters and HR people are looking for). Get a LAB up and running to tinker and learn the technologies you are interested in. Get involved by joining meetup groups or Cisco users groups aka Network.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood Engineers are in high demand, on my Linkedin Page I have Happily Employed and DO NOT CONTACT ME working on CERTS. Yet I still get 1 - 2 calls a week/in-mails about jobs (without looking mind you). Also I have a recruiter who takes me out to lunch at least once a month. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor me Management isn't even an option. If you like that stuff go for it. However, that said I have a buddy who is a CIO and he has his CISSP as well. Why ? Because when the Axe swings who is the first to get it? Do they cut Engineers or Salespeople? No they are necessary if they want to keep their businesses afloat. Even PMs are a little more important. When the Ax swings they start looking to consolidate management. Managers are a dime a dozen. Sure you can be making a fat salary doing nothing for 5 - 10 years but when you are canned how do you prove you were a good manager ? I asked one of my recruiter friends and they told me stay near the tech and you are always safe. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would say if you want a raise and less stress work 10 years-ish as an Engineer and go into Sales Engineering etc. They are the necessary people who are the backbone of the company. They get paid well (Salary plus comission) and no outage windows or implementations. When I want to retire I think I may do that :)",

I've always enjoyed computers growing up I've built (assembled lol) computers troubleshoot the problems I caused.  At my last employer we would \"service\" laptops we sold/leased and part of my tenure there I was responsible for service of all products to include computers so there wasn't much but I did some troubleshooting and minor repair (swapped a HD, Power Supply, or RAM stick) re-imaged workstations etc. That wasn't my main job but it was part of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy concern is being a 40yo with a 5yo kid & bills most entry level IT jobs pay 10-15/hr in my market (moving is definitely a possibility for the right $) currently what approach would you recommend to find better paying job once I've obtained my CCNA as I see many many entry level positions with the cert still require experience of 2-3 years .",

            "CCNA is a fine 1st cert.  Comptia Net+ or A+ is not going to have the same \"street cred\" power as CCNA.  CCNA still holds more weight currently.  When we look at entry level resume's CCNA stands out.  The net+ and A+ still had some value in our minds, they are nice complimentary certs, but CCNA still carries the better rep.  Then you can couple CCNA with Security+ and you have a solid cert foundation.  Many companies like that Sec+ cert.  It opens the door of any DOD/Government type IT role as Sec+ is mandatory for those.  That all depends on you though.  It's not gospel.  To stay on topic though, the CCNA is great.\n\nI recommend you hop on ebay, get yourself a Catalyst 2960s switch (its gigabit, can find them for under 100)\n\nThe 2960s will have some basic ip routing capabilities.  Its a cheap way to get hands on working with VLANS, segregating VLAN traffic, inter-vlan routing using SVI's.  Put your home WIFI on one vlan, your LAN clients on another, servers on another.  Play, google, geek out.  Blow your network up, realize why you blew it up, start over.  Nothing more satisfying then those moments where you get something working and traffic flowing.  It's empowering and motivational.  I started 25yrs ago, and there is no better feeling correcting something that was fighting you tooth and nail.  You get to stand up, give a double middle finger salute to the inanimate object, curse at it, and then tell it that you WON!\n\nPacket Tracer is great, but actually USING this stuff in a live environment, that's the hands on stuff that gives you an edge versus others.  You do things and you see things.  You see how easy it can be to bring your network to its knees with a single bad command, and why you need to be careful in a production environment.  How to work under pressure because you killed your girlfriend or Wife's network access.

After 10 months, I took another role at a school district that was similar but more pay. While there I obtained by Network+ then the brutal but rewarding CCNA.

Which certification would be more valuable early on and help me transition toward networking and security faster?\n\nAlso, any tips on how to make the most out of a helpdesk role to build skills for networking/security would be amazing!\n\nThanks for your advice! \ud83d\ude0a",
        "comments": [
            "2 very different certifications. A+ is very entry level, Jack of all trades cert with a tiny bit of networking in it. Cisco's CCNA dives much deeper into networking, and does not cover general IT topics seen in A+. Also, CompTIA (A+) is vendor neutral, while Cisco focuses on....Cisco devices. With that being said, it doesn't mean that you won't understand networking if it involves hardware from other manufacturers. It still does a great job going over vendor neutral concepts like IP addressing, security, cloud and networking, and more.\n\nGenerally, the question people ask is whether they should pursue CompTIA Network+ or Cisco CCNA.\n\nYou said that networking is your long term goal. My advice is to focus on the now or your very next move. For most people who lack experience, that is usually help desk/entry level IT support. CCNA is not really a help desk cert. You are very, very unlikely to interact with Cisco command line interface, to set IP addresses and many other skills covered in the CCNA, while working help desk.\n\nSo, the recommendation is usually A+ but chances are you already know most of what is covered in the A+, due to your education. You have to research the job market for your geographic area. See what is in demand, requirements, reach out directly to IT professionals and employers, and ask your professors. \n\nKeep in mind these certs are valid for 3 years. The A+ consists of 2 cores and 2 exams. In my opinion, A+ is very overpriced for what it delivers and the chances of actually getting a job with this cert in today's market. \n\nFrom my personal experience (I'm in the USA), the A+ was almost completely useless. It got me a couple of interviews, as it helps in moving past the initial AI and HR screening, but this cert alone rarely gets candidates a job, considering how competitive the market has been post Covid. I don't know how it is in the UK and other countries, but I'd be surprised if it were significantly better. \n\nIf I were to do it again, I'd just go over the material for A+ (grab a book and watch Professor Messer's videos on YouTube), but I wouldn't pay for the exams!\n\nI got my job because I reached out directly to a local IT business owner at the right time. Now I'm focusing on more advanced topics and certs (networking, cloud, automation, security). For others, the A+ was worth it as it was a determining factor in securing an entry level role.\n\nCCNA is far more interesting, respected, and worth the investment, imo. But again, networking isn't really entry level (other than networking tech roles). A lot of people start at the help desk, then study for CCNA as they want to become network admin or similar roles.",
            "If you have a good basic understanding of networking and TCP/IP, I would go for the CCNA. Or you could do A+ followed by the CCNA.",
            "In certain corners of the internet and definitely some subs, the A+ is spoke about as if it's a bare-bones super basic certification that is hardly worth getting. This couldn't be less true. The A+ covers a huge breadth of information that an IT technician or system administrator could reasonably be expected to know. The A+ was by far the most impactful cert I have earned so far because it gave me important knowledge I use every single day.\n\nIf you have the A+ and the CCNA, you have the potential to be unstoppable. It's a very good combination. But the A+ should come first. The two will complement one another very nicely, but the A+ will give you a solid baseline knowledge of networking before moving to the CCNA. For the A+ you have to learn a lot of the basic concepts that any CCNA course will start out on, plus you will also have to learn to do some basic network troubleshooting plus Windows and UNIX networking commands. This all overlaps with the CCNA.",
            "I am pretty sure people want to get job offers, not interviews that lead nowhere because you're up against people who have experience. So yeah, if I had to do it again, I would simply go over the material and I will not pay for the exams. Like I said, A+ was not a determining factor in securing my job.\n\nWhen you're about to get a degree, like OP,  maybe your budget for certs and training would be better used if you were to save that money and invest in other certs."

        "content": "Basically, title. When I initially began my CCNA/Community College journey the year was 2013. At the time I was able to elect for an AA in Computer and Information Sciences. Life happened and I had to step away from education to focus on work full-time (I was doing so well; 3.5 GPA and knocked out like 30+ credits in a few semesters). When I realized I still had the itch to get into networks/IT/Help Desk it was Spring 2022. The AA in Comp and Info Sciences was done away during my time away from college. I re-enrolled as someone electing to pursue an A.A. in Mathematics. I figured it would look good on the resume (It's an AA, so the requirements for this degree are near identical to most other AA degree pathways with only slight variation. My highest level math course is College Algebra or Statistics).\n\n  \nFast forward to today. I am literally one elective course away from my A.A. and I saved CCNA III for last (I took CCNA I & II back in 2013-2014. Used to be 4 CCNA courses back then. They have since concatenated the curriculum down into three courses). My advisor was informing me how I could take CCNA III BUT it would not count as an elective towards my AA as its not a qualified elective for an AA degree pathway (bummer). It would qualify as an elective for the A.S. or B.S. degrees in IT/Cyber/Info Management Systems though.\n\nThat got me thinking, because as of now the goal is to get the AA and CCNA cert under my belt and then begin applying for jobs (so close), will an AA in a random field be restrictive when I go to apply for jobs? If I continue pursuing the AA, I would only be one elective course away from completion. I would take the elective course this upcoming spring, brush up on my CCNA 1 & 2 materials on the side, and sit in on CCNA 3 in the fall. Boom. Done.\n\nIf I choose to instead shift my election over to the A.S. degree I would be, about, six courses away from completion (of which, one of would be an elective course of my choosing i.e., CCNA 3).\n\nIf I elect to finish up my A.A. I would still be eligible to transition right into the B.S. in IT Management/Cyber pathway as I have satisfied all pre-reqs. I do not want to begin a bachelor program without first securing a help desk/entry-level-tech role though, as I want experience more than anything. As of now, I am leaning towards just finishing up the AA and CCNA to begin applying for jobs.\n\nNote: I know this question may be better suited for r/ITCareerQuestions , but I hangout on r/ccna almost exclusively :p THX for reading!",

        "content": "Hello Everyone,\n\nI\u2019m 19 years old and currently in my first year of the Computer Programming program at Durham College. While I enjoy programming, my true passion lies in the field of Networking. I\u2019m fascinated by the intricacies of how networks operate, their role in driving modern technology, and the exciting career opportunities the field offers. With this in mind, I\u2019m planning to switch to the Computer Systems program at Durham College, as it offers more specialized courses in Networking and Data Communications\u2014areas not covered in my current program.\n\nI\u2019m seeking advice on how to best prepare for a career in Networking and ensure I meet the industry\u2019s expectations. I\u2019m currently evaluating several options to determine the most effective path:\n\n1. **Certifications vs. Formal Education**: I plan to pursue key industry certifications like CCNA, CCNP, and eventually CCIE. These certifications seem highly regarded and demonstrate hands-on knowledge in Networking. However, I\u2019ve heard mixed opinions on whether certifications alone are enough. I\u2019m wondering if employers\u2014particularly in Canada\u2014value certifications more than a degree or diploma, or if a formal degree is becoming a necessity in the field.\n2. **Switching Programs**: I\u2019m seriously considering transitioning to the Computer Systems program at Durham College, as it focuses more heavily on Networking and Data Communications. This would allow me to stay in college while gaining foundational knowledge in Networking and pursuing certifications simultaneously.\n3. **Considering the Degree Route**: If a degree is a significant requirement for entering and advancing in the Networking field, I would also be open to leaving college and pursuing a university degree in Networking, Computer Science, or a related field. While this would be a big decision, I\u2019m willing to take this step if it provides a more secure and advantageous position in the industry.\n4. **Roadmap for Success**: For professionals currently working in Networking, I\u2019d love to know what the ideal path looks like based on your experience. Do employers focus more on certifications, degrees, or practical hands-on experience? How important are internships or co-op opportunities in securing that first Networking job?\n\nI\u2019m trying to ensure I make the right decisions now to build a strong and competitive career in Networking. Since I live in Canada, I\u2019m also curious about any region-specific advice regarding certifications, education, or job market trends.\n\nThank you for taking the time to share your insights\u2014I truly appreciate your guidance and advice!",

        "content": "Hi community. It's a lot of material. Like a lot a lot. You all know. And here's the thing: with each lecture and lab, I get it and I'm almost always able to complete the lab without watching the video. On the weekends I build larger labs in PT that bring together multiple knowledge domains. I also lab with other technologies like Proxmox by building virtual networks with virtual switches, Pfsense, networks in Azure, etc. I would by no means say I'm super competent, but definitely learning and tinkering.\n\nBut, I also feel like I'm forgetting a huge amount as well. My strategy is:\n\n1. Listen to the lecture, follow along in the notes.  \n2. Re-read the lecture notes carefully  \n3. Do the Ankie deck  \n4. Do the lab  \n5. Continue doing the Ankie cards\n\nSome times I mix up the order a bit. But it's been working out well, but at 70% of the way in I feel like I'm forgetting a lot as well. At this point I don't have time to do every Ankie deck every day, so some are going on the backburner. I also don't have time to build big labs every day because I work full time.\n\nWhen it comes to the exam, I'm not all that concerned about passing with a high score. I'm way more concerned about learning as much as I can that will actually allow me to have the practical skills needed to start taking on more networking responsibility in my job and/or transition to a networking role in another company. I'm less interested in remembering every detail or memorizing every IEEE 802 standard or every multicast address for this or that protocol, etc.\n\nSo my question is, notwithstanding the desire to actually pass the exam, what are the subject areas and skill sets that are most important to practice and really learn very well for an IT Technician to move to a network administrator, system administrator or engineering role? What are the areas that can be safely glossed over?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

I had zero experience and a Psychology degree. I ended up being good enough at that job that within about a year and a half they moved me up to Networking System Support despite me having no actual networking knowledge at the time. The stipulation was that I was going to be learning from the Network Systems Engineer, but shockingly a couple weeks later he got a new job and left. So I was basically the lone networking guy for the entire school district for a while. We had a CDW consultant visiting us a couple times a week and he was a major resource, but otherwise I was alone. During this period I studied my ASS off for the CCENT, and managed to get the certification in roughly two months. I was killing it in the role and loved networking in general, but the pay was pretty pathetic. About 6 months into that role the same Systems Engineer that left me out to dry texted me saying he wanted to bring me on to the very small MSP that he had moved on to. I was going to be only the third employee at the company, but they were going to give me a $10,000 raise. I accepted the position and got the title of Jr. Network Engineer and I was loving it there. Worked for them from October 2019-May 2020...and lost the job because COVID ran the company out of money. So during the unemployment scramble I applied all over the place and ended up getting a job with a local credit union as a Helpdesk Specialist. It was the best opportunity I was able to find quickly and the pay was reasonable. But unfortunately my job title went straight back down. From Tech Specialist->System Support->Jr. Network Enginner->Helpdesk Specialist. \n\nSo my questions are...what should my next move be? Will this drop in job title hurt me in the future? What certification should I work towards next? I only have CCENT currently, and my rapid job movement has led me to starting and stopping multiple study paths. I was working towards CCNA but stopped when I moved to the MSP because none of our clients used Cisco and I thought it would be better to work towards something like Security+....but now I've stopped studying Security+ because I don't see how it helps me here. The Helpdesk job I'm at now is very boring but I think many people around the department can already tell I'm skilled and overqualified.

I've stumped about everybody with a simple DNS questions.\n\nAnyway, I let all my certs expire like 12yrs ago.

        "content": "Hello fellow techies,\n\n   I would like some two cents on my quasi-unique situation. Initially, I started with JavaScript, React, SQL, Python, and I messed about with Linux to boot. Basically, I've had a couple of contractual gigs working with CRM & SEO. The two jobs were short-lived (seven and a half months total) but they are tech-adjacent roles that I believe helped me tremendously. Anyway, after many failed attempts at getting a developer role, I got a Software tester position, QA. The role is comparable to what an entry level help desk associate would make: $22. The role is a steppingstone, but I am not that sure that I can see the next level anytime to soon. The lion's share of developer roles at my company are all outsourced to countries that most have never even heard of. Of course, I know that one should test the market and see what is out there, but it does leave a sour taste in your mouth that there aren't many advancement opportunities within your company.\n\nMoreover, about a month ago I started to look into certifications and the various avenues I can take. After a bit of research, I decided to go for a CCNA. My thing is I don't want to cast a wide net and make more lateral career moves than necessary. With my current job I have had administrative, backend, api testing, and have been a part of many of releases. Pretty neat. My thing is if I get my CCNA, would I be able to transition into something higher than entry level? I hear a lot of people say the CCNA is a door opener but at the same time you have to start at the bottom sometimes. I am totally fine with that but I kind of already am doing that. In a nutshell what would be the fastest avenue (in your opinion) to get out of financial purgatory? Should I stick with software because I am already in it or make an attempt at networking and its neighboring fields? I have taught myself a lot to get to this position which got me out of the service industry, but I would say I am not a passionate techie. I see a field that is scalable and lucrative. Working to live and eventually financial freedom is my overall goal out of this. Lastly, any tips from the vets or people who have been in a similar situation, please, your advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading this long & drawn-out post.",

            "The thing about getting a CCNA is that without real world hands on experience, it\u2019s all concepts in your head. There\u2019s only so much labbing you can do. If I were in your shoes, I\u2019d apply to a small MSP with a decent client base in your area. A small MSP lets you jump around department to department ( service desk, onsite tech, sys engineering, project work, NOC, security etc) and you can wear many hats, as long as you are willing to learn.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn interviews, ask about the stack they offer clients and if it fits the criteria, jump on it.\u00a0 I started my CCNA journey and I was solely focused on being a network engineer.\u00a0\n\nWhile i did get the cert which may have opened the door for me, starting at the service desk, I quickly realized i knew a whole lot less than I originally thought. It exposed me to a whole new world of sys administration that I would not have experienced if I just worked at a large company maintaining network equipment.\u00a0"

Mention the desire that you're interested in an IT role, but you're willing to work in customer service so that you can laterally move within the company to an IT related role.  Why customer service you may ask?  Because it's a skill that takes time to train from scratch, and most companies don't want to invest time and resources to train people.  If you're already familiar wit those skills, it's easier for the company to bring you up to speed about their industry.    \n  \nI used to work for a call center, and that experience got me my last three roles, including my current one.  I sold them on the customer service skills first, and the IT skills second.  I was able to laterally move to IT related positions within all three of those companies.\n\nThe mistake that people make is that they think (and this is mostly from 'educational institutions' selling this idea) that they can do a career change into an IT role with a few certifications or going back to school.  Earning the certifications and/or degree(s) is part of the challenge.  You can earn every certification and degree that exists, but if you don't have the practical experience and knowledge to perform in the role a company would hire you for, you're not going to get hired.\n\nOne of the best bosses I had told me that the mistakes that people make when pursuing an IT related role is that they think the IT role is primary and the industry that IT will support is secondary.  It's the other way around.  Find an industry that you're interested in, get a position within that industry, and laterally move to an IT role related to that industry.  This way, shared skills within a variety of industries can translate, and you can switch to a different industry if the first one doesn't work out."
