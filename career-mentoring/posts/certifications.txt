85% of those hiring developers (in the US) say that certifications are not important

Source: http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/developer-staffing-survey-needs-outstrip/240006708?pgno=4

This probably won't come as a surprise to folks that have hung around here for a while, but I thought it was nice to find some evidence to back it up.

**Comments:**
- It's from a survey of people who read Dr. Dobb's; I don't think I've ever met anyone in person who reads that particular publication. But nonetheless, it seems to be fairly accurate of the field as a whole.
- Cool article, other than it being structured in a ridiculous way for reading, 7 pages with 1-2 paragraphs each
- I find when looking at a candidate's resume that the more "certifications" they have the worse the interview is going to go. Number of Certifications v. How well the interview goes has a correlation of at least -.8.
- My boss said the other day, "Certifications are useless, except for maybe saving the company you're going to some money; they don't have to pay for it." I never looked at it that way.
- A senior staffing person at a very large agency recently told me (during the interview) that certifications were crucial to gaining entry into IT fields. Obviously we have all heard otherwise. Now I'm curious, does anybody share this opinion? Have you heard this before? If so, which ones are actually worth getting?
- I think the most daunting thing since I've seen looking around is where do people with no experience but have a AA, AS, BS get started without having certifications to help decorate their resume? I honestly don't think I've seen more than one place willing to take people without experience in my local area on the career websites.
- That's because just knowing a programming language is meaningless.. You need to understand how software development works. A good analogy would be someone that can read/write/speak English well.. Just because you can read/write/speak English, that doesn't make you a good writer.  It's the same thing when it comes to programming, just because you can read and write statement in a particular language, that doesn't make you a good developer. When companies hire a developer, they want ppl that can write code, not just read them.
- Certifications can be useful in terms of the skills behind them, but there kinda meaningless in themselves simply due to the fact you can get most of them without ever really needing to have much beyond a passing knowledge of the subject. Some certification's aren't even fail-able :p
- It was more useful before the web came along.
- http://www.drdobbs.com/article/print?articleId=240006708&siteSectionName=architecture-and-design
- But it maximizes ad profits and pageviews!
- There is clearly something about Java certifications that make people worse at Java.
- I think it's fair to say that it's different in "IT fields" as a whole than in software development specifically.  I understand that if you want to work with Cisco networks, Cisco certifications make a big difference.
- In lieu of any other experience, it's the only way to get past HR drones at Very Large Agencies.  Keep in mind that Very Large Agencies and their customers are primarily interested in placing people that can already do the job and have no need to learn new skils - you don't hire a temp/contractor for 6 months to spend 2 of them training him. People that are actually interested in having long-term employees & developing their skills take an entirely different approach.
- Consulting agency?  They want certifications so they can say "See, we have 100 SCJP or MCSE on staff" so they can bill even higher rates. For a full time gig, certifications have been frowned on in my experience, and those with certifications typically suck at their job.  This is for software certs only, not CCNA or the like.
- But the pictures :( !!
- You are correct.  If you are a sysadmin, A+ might help.  CCNA is mandatory almost in the networking field.
- Depends on the sort of sysadmin.
- Sure, everything is relative and there is no panacea certification for limited experience.  From what I've seen an A+ doesn't hurt, unlike most of the software development certifications.

Certification

[removed]

**Comments:**
- Certifications are useless. Just for the hell of it, I got certified as a Sun Certified Java Programmer (now it's Oracle something) to see what the process was like. You take a computer-based test with ~20 questions. You get certified if you pass with 55% or higher. The questions were tough, but the process/certification didn't help me in the long run. I leave it off my resume because experience matters much more than certification. My advice? If you want to grow, write code. Build a web app/site. Contribute to an open source project. Create a new project and put it on Github. Any of these things will help more than certification.
- Certifications are useless to software developers, with the sole exception of Microsoft's certifications, because they can make your company eligible for partnership.
- I really don't see why you would. If you want to show that you are willing to work hard and grow in the process, learn something new. Just for fun, I'm learning Arduino and, whenever I get around to it, writing code for car computers. So the best way to grow is to do something completely new. You don't need a certification for that.
- The real value of certification is the process of studying to get it - the cert itself is almost always useless.
- If you want to get into management, you could look into stuff like PMP and ITIL
- Texas is doing a PE for Software Engineering starting in 2013.  I'm not sure how much value it will have.  If it something you are interested in you might consider taking the FE if you haven't already. http://engineers.texas.gov/software.html

- Thanks im a freshman majoring in CS, and my dad says im wasting my time, saying a certification is better than a degree, but your making it sound like a waste of $
- "DBA admin" ...? Database administrator admin?
- That's a good way to put it. It cost me $60 to get certified, and so far no employers interviewing me have asked if I had any. Experience is a lot more valuable, and there are plenty of ways to get that for free.
- Somebody has to manage those DBAs.
- Care to share those ways, ill need all the options i can get. he keeps goin on and on on how a black man has to be be 200% better -sigh-
- Sure, here are a few: * Build up an online presence as a coder using github. Find an open source project you like and find an area where you can contribute code. * Get an internship. As a freshman it may be tough finding an employer (although local companies may be better about this), but job experience means a lot in software. If you have a good rapport with a professor, they may be able to connect you with a potential employer. * Do research. Some professors do in fact hire undergraduates as research assistants. This is great experience if you write code, since you get to learn quickly what code can be used for. Again, talk to a professor. * Build an Android app and release it. This is a valuable skill to have, since many companies want to build mobile versions of their existing software. * Create a new project: game/app/whatever. Put it in Github. Even if you're not contributing to someone else's work, you're letting people know what your programming skills are.

Certifications/Licenses to get for programming internships/jobs (x-post from /r/programming)

I'm going to be attending my freshman year within a computer science program at a university this fall. My program does not offer a co-operative education program nor an internship base, so I'll have to scout and apply for programming internships by myself during the next 4 summers. I was wondering what certifications/licenses you guys would suggest I get for the purpose of applying to jobs for that boost I would need by then. I'm interesting in programming business-wise (enterprise applications) with C/C++/Java/Python, but obviously having no industry experience, I wouldn't exactly know where to start in terms of a license.

**Comments:**
- Don't waste your money, most businesses don't take these seriously. Instead actually program something, post it somewhere with your name, and show it off later. Companies want to hire interns who can formulate algorithms to solutions, solve problems with code, and aren't scared of writing code on their own. You need to be able to talk about your experience writing code in an interview. Save projects that you do in school. I have showed multiple employers code that I have written for school projects, its not uncommon. Save it in like dropbox for easy access whenever you need it. -> I am interning at Intel, and this is my 3rd internship in college as a cs major. EDIT: I have been asked many times for my github account. Apparently this is a new thing going on with some companies. So try to maintain your stuff on github. Although I never caught on to this, I was always able to show through other means code that I have written. Once you get your account going with some stuff on it, put your profile url on your resume. If employers don't ask for it, then mention it. This really shows initiative.
- There is no point in getting certifications without real experience... Gain experience, then think about getting something like a certificate... they're not worthless, but they will be if you only have basic knowledge to back it up) good luck!)
- This, exactly. I came here to write nearly the exact same thing. In addition, once you get experienced enough, contribute to open source projects. ~~ Bitches~~ Companies love open source projects. -> Developer for 3 years

How important is it to get certifications for the different languages that I'm working with if I want to be a professional programmer?

How important is it to get certifications for the different languages that I'm working with if I want to be a professional programmer?

**Comments:**
- I give them literally zero consideration when hiring
- I wouldn't consider Certifications to be important as a programmer. Network admin maybe - They have stuff like A+, Network+, Cisco certs, etc... - but not as a programmer. As a programmer, it's education, experience, domain and known paradigms. College degree for education. Completed projects for experience. What domain you work in (Web, health care, insurance, etc). Finally, the different [programming paradigms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm) you have experience in. Once you learn shell scripting, it's not that hard to do the same in Bash or Powershell... once you learn OOP in Java, it's not that hard to pick up C#. I've yet to hear of a good certificate that has any weight behind it for programmers. The only reason I'd consider certs, personally, as a programmer would be for college credits. A+, Linux+, etc translate into certain classes. Kinda like testing out of a class.
- I didn't even know you could be certified for a programming language, so there's that.
- It is actually a negative - most certifications do not say anything about whether you can program in them at all.  Putting them on your resume is like putting on a reference from a guy everyone knows is an idiot and an asshole. There are a few subindustries where certs are important, and a few certs that are actually hard to get and prove you know something, but in general, no.
- Certs are great if you're going into government/government contracting since they have specific requirements for each level. Other than that, nobody gives a damn.
- At best, I disregard any vendor certificates a candidate has. In the past, I tended to look poorly on them as we had a lot of 90 day 'get your MCSD' programs years ago and anyone coming in with one of them had a crappy understanding of programming, of the language, and of the ecosystem.
- Please read whole post. Some certs are legitimate, but by and large real programming languages don't have or need certifications, and as a programmer you are expected to know that. The exceptions start popping up when there is, in fact, a single company that is known for maintaining and developing a particular language or technology subset.  Microsoft and SQL spring to mind; Oracle DB certification, CISCO network certification etc. If you have no experience with a technology, these certifications would be useful on a resume or during an interview, because you can use them as proof that you're studying new technologies. The only _absolute_ case where this doesn't apply is consulting.  Consulting firms always want to provide the customer, inevitably a client that knows nothing about technology, with proof that the random programmer they're getting is "the very best."  In order to do that, the consulting firm may well want you to get every certification under the sun, and as such, having certifications may be helpful in getting said jobs, but I can only speak from within the consulting world of devs working on the microsoft stack.  Even here though, it'd just be a plus, no one actually working in tech would actually think the certifications would be a good indicator of your level of knowledge, and the desired certs would almost certainly be for specific products (SharePoint, CRM, MVP, etc), not thinks like programming languages, components, frameworks or libraries.
- I tend to differ with most people here. I agree that they should not be an important consideration when deciding who to hire. But as someone who has done certifications (LPI level 1 and some Java certs) I can assure, that they helped me learn a lot of new stuff. Stuff I probably still wouldn't know otherwise. And not just esoteric stuff, but stuff that is useful to know. That helps me to be faster and to be more efficient. All in all, of course, your general experience as well as practise with a similar kind of projects are much more important. Also knowledge of the domaoin you are developing in often is more important. It just that certs are not useless as many here - and on other developer sites or dev blogs - state.
- > putting on a reference from a guy everyone knows is an idiot and an asshole. Literally LOL'ed at that.  Now the whole office thinks I'm crazy.  Thanks ಠ_ಠ
- Thanks for your post.  Whew, I was honestly worried I'd have to start studying for tests instead of build applications.  Time spent coding > time spent studying.
- You'll do fine : ) Remember to push the stuff you think is well written to a public github account haha

JAVA certifications - helpful in getting a job?

Hello all,  I'm a teacher currently but really want to get out of the profession.  My local community college offers a JAVA certification.  My four year degree is in Geology/Secondary Education.  Could a certification in JAVA open a door for me to a new career?

**Comments:**
- NO. Certifications are worse than useless. I have known managers that threw away resumes that came with certifications because the kind of people that had certifications were so bad they weren't worth interviewing. Certifications are a waste of money and time. If you really want to get into programming, develop a portfolio to show off on that resume.
- Certifications are useless. Start contributing to the open source projects instead.
- It really depends on you and the program. As a general rule of thumb programming certifications are all but useless. Many IT certs have their role but developer ones just aren't seen the same way. However, if you learn much better with a specific goal and format then I'd look into the certification program anyway. Even if being able to say you have it doesn't do you much good the structure might.
- Thank you everyone for your responses!
- A certification will get you something...but it will stop short of going all the way. I think it could help you get in the door in most small/mid level companies. From there you could grow and look somewhere else. Eventually you will hit a point when you should stop mentioning that certification on your resume. Most super serious CS places (Google, Amazon, Facebook, MS) don't like to see certifications on a resume. They feel this way for several reasons, but generally that certifications fall below a quality bar that they need, and those being certified should know this. Ultimately, do a real project and use that to get hired. It will go further and be more valuable to you and your employer.
- Since you are coming from a non CS education background then I would say the certificate will be a good place to start. Unfortunately, though, for all certificate nowadays there is an answers dumb, so beside being certified you also need to work hard on your skills. The programmer certificate will be a good place to open your eyes on what the basic Java programming is about.
- The site below offers reasonable online classes and is affiliated with University of Illinois - a top 5 CS school. I don't have personal experience with them but it looks legit. [O'Reilly School of Technology] (http://www.oreillyschool.com/why/illinois.php)
- Alright here's my thought process. I have very little experience with Java.  I get the certification so I can learn some things. What would a portfolio look like? Stand alone programs or work on something else? How do you show that off during an interview? Or can I learn what I need from a few classes?
- NO!  - Only if you fall under certain developer levels, (i.e. Jr. Developer, app developer, sr. developer, principal developer). Yes?... - If you fall under these roles (Team Lead, Software Architect, CTO, CS book author). If you are in a higher-level role, certs aren't required in many places except some software shops.  Here's the whole point of certs, (it makes clients/customers 'trust' the businesses they are working with), and that's HIGHLY valued at the executive level.  Knowing a software shop has a certified developer for the technology being used laying out the "blueprint" of the software.  What helps you personally are three things by having a cert: 1. You are valuably sought out by companies that 'promised' a certified developer leading a project, (happens a lot with Microsoft certs).  Again, at the architect, team-lead level. 2. Certain certs, give you access to "members-only" previews of upcoming versions of software and training, as well as online-access to other certified developers, (should you need to staff). =) 3. It's a good refresher on current tech, (even in your current field).  If your a C# god/ninja/guru at your current job, and take a well credited test and pass, you'll see where your strong and where your weakest, and if you fail it will be a good reminder on where you stand. Final advice if your thinking about a cert: Don't invest too much money or at all if you want to be certified, unless your boss or bosses boss would like you to have one, but once you have one it's nice to have.
- Thanks for your reply.  I think I'll have to get my foot in somewhere to get some experience before moving into something bigger and better.  But I'm desperate to get out of where I'm at, so small/ mid level company sounds awesome!
- Certifications do not really teach you things that are useful to the craft of programming. I mean, sure you will know the ins and outs of the volatile keyword, but I have been programming professionally for years in Java and I have never used that keyword. Neither have any of my coworkers. (Maybe one used it. Once. Years ago). But certs don't teach you things like program architecture or planning or what design patterns to use. Stand alone programs would be good - I usually recommend implemented your favorite board game or three as a multiplayer project. Those are easy to understand but complex enough that you show off a lot. Open source contributions can be good also but that can be hard to get into. In the interview you'll usually be doing whiteboard coding. The portfolios and so forth are for the resume. A few class and some programming book (do ALL the exercises, even if you already think you know the material) will be far more useful than any cert.
- Well, I have to disagree with this. The kind of people with certs are the kind of people I never want anywhere near code. Honestly, if a 'certified developer' is a company's selling point, I expect that company to be failing soon. Certs are a waste of time and money, no matter who is paying for them.
- White board coding...writing lines of code out on a white board? Sorry one more question...then how can I get the attention from a company without a CS degree or something on my resume so they look at it?
- I agree with the hesitation, you don't want a fresh out of school developer with 20 certs.  Those are the kinds of devs that ruin certifications. Also having a certified developer on staff is a 'nice to have' for most clients I work with. More so when your project's budget is 2.3mil +
- For the first question: yes, that is exactly what whiteboard coding is. Easy to do in an interview. For the second question: I've already answered this. You put the projects from your portfolio on your resume.
- thank you!

Is it true that IT certifications are not respected?

[deleted]

**Comments:**
- I answered your other post - you're confusing IT with the much broader CS. CS can encompass things like IT work, but also software development and other things. For IT, you don't necessarily need a degree to get into it (same with CS, really), but starting off, you will be at a disadvantage if you haven't already been doing it for a while. Your competition will be people with degrees in related fields (like CS or information systems), and that implies something that not having a degree and not having relevant experience can't. Certifications are useful for furthering your progression and advancement in actual IT roles (like CCNP, RHCE), but you don't get them as someone with zero experience, they take a while to build up to. For CS jobs like software development/software engineering, certs are not useful at all, unless they are something like Project Management Professional. Actual programming certs like Java certs and what not aren't really favored because they don't imply much other than you can pass a multiple choice test.
- CS covers a really broad spectrum of work, which IT is a small part of. Someone with a CS degree could go into IT. Many do. But CS also covers software development, and software development is very different from IT. IT is concerned with the operations of a company -- IT professionals manage servers and databases, performance tune things, requisition hardware, handle networking and security, and often provide desktop and application support to people in a company. It is definitely possible to get into IT without a degree, although chances are you will be competing with candidates who have degrees, or relevant experience. Software developers write code. They write lots of code, and rarely concern themselves with IT infrastructure stuff. Software development can also be done without a CS degree, but a degree does give you a huge boost in that it assures your employer that you've been exposed to certain basic programming concepts and theories which are good to know. I say this because in *software development*, certs are pretty useless. Education, experience, and a demonstrated track record of being good are what get you jobs and promotions in software development. For *IT*, it's a little different. Certs can matter, but the ones that generally matter are the harder-to-get ones like Cisco, Microsoft or Red Hat. Certs that require prior experience, recommendations, or for you to perform the test on a live system are the serious ones. Most serious certs require re-certification every year or two. Cert tests that have no prerequisites and that are merely multiple choice questions are somewhat of junk.
- My understanding of it is: If you're trying to impress the HR folks at a non-tech company looking for someone "in IT", then get all the certifications you can because they will eat that shit up. If you're trying to impress the Senior Dev folks at a tech company, your certifications will mean nothing, your CS degree will mean something, and your work experience/demonstrated ability to code will mean everything.
- A few years ago I was looking to go into networking and did the A+/Network+/Security+ and was working towards a CCNA. One thing I noticed is that a number of the positions wanted a cs degree. I assume this is part of what's confusing you. Let's be clear, a degree in CS has little/nothing to do with IT/network admin jobs BUT quite a few jobs require it because the HR people are idiots. I ended up back in school to get a cs degree originally to go into network jobs, but then learned more about the field and have completely left the idea of IT/network admin idea behind. Getting into an entry level network admin job seemed overly difficult considering the hours/pay (it also helps that I enjoy programming).
- It depends completely on the type of job you're applying for. Many people have successful careers in IT or software development with no certificates or degrees of any kind. As long as you  can demonstrate that you know your shit that will suffice for most companies.
- They are good for motivation if you want to learn a new product and get a nice certificate. Not very useful for jobs because it is very easy to cheat.
- That makes a lot of sense. I only got into reddit a few months ago, and it still amazes me that there are people out there willing to spend time/effort helping people like me, so thank you.
- Thanks, that's kinda how I felt about it but was really experiencing the self doubt. Especially the post reddit self doubt lol. Glad to have the reassurance I'm not crazy, or at least not for these thoughts. :)
- This. Lately, I've interviewed people for development positions directly and try to bypass our HR department as much as possible.  Those people are morons and have no idea how to screen candidates.  I've been sent people who couldn't code fizzbuzz but sounded AWESOME to the HR reps.  And I've talked to people who were turned away by our HR department who were actually quite talented and friendly.  It's very frustrating. I've made it clear to HR that they are not to talk to candidates for the engineering group anymore.  :) For us, the criteria for hiring is a) know how to program, b) have some understanding of good design principles (read The Pragmatic Programmer if you haven't already), and c) don't be a jerk.  If you can do that, you'll be fine - it just takes finding the right opportunity. We don't care about particular skills or what languages are known as much as we care about passion for development.  A competent engineer can learn a new language quickly while retaining the good ideas they've learned from the technologies they already understand.

Are certifications a sufficient substitute for an IS/CS degree?

My education is in finance and technically I work in the field, but the reality of my job is that I spend the majority of my time doing IT focused work: SharePoint administration, architecture, and basic development, database development (SSAS-business intelligence), etc.  I've spent the last 8 months absorbing as much information as I can via books, the internet, IT staff, and hands on experience in order to be successful and frankly, because IT related topics are very interesting to me.  Everything I do is on the Microsoft stack.

I've begun studying for the MSCA SQL Server certification and will likely take others after the fact, but am curious whether or not these certifications will suffice as a substitute for a degree in IS or CS.  The ultimate intent would be to position myself to work in IT full time as an "official" member of the IT department rather than my current ambiguous position.

Any provided advice would be appreciated, or if I can provide more information I would be happy to do so.  I'm a bit rushed because I'm on lunch, but this was at the front of my mind so I thought it could be beneficial to ask.  Thanks!

- No. To be honest spending any of your own money on certifications is essentially a waste. Unless you currently have a job that is telling you to get them you'd be better spending your time doing something else. Speaking of something else, start doing everything you can to engrain yourself in what you want to be doing. If you want to become an "official" member of your current IT staff let your IT staff know. See what tips they can offer you, see if they would be willing to train you, or even have  you come in during your off days to see how things in their department run.
- To answer your main question, no. A bunch of certs will never be a sufficient replacement for a degree in cs. However, that's not to say that you can't make a career out of experience + certifications.
- Other than the actual knowledge there are plenty of jobs that require a degree to be eligible and without one you may be missing out on those positions.
- The certs represent practical or applied experience.  The degree will give you the underlying theory.
- It seems that the consensus is no.  I suppose the next logical question is which degree: CS or IS?
- I'll probably get certified on the MS stack regardless, but I'd like to understand the theory/fundamentals behind everything as well.  Thanks for the input.
- > But it will certainly not hurt I dunno. I had a couple of manager that threw away resumes with certs on them, on the logic of "if they were stupid enough to think certs were useful, then I don't want them on my team". Good boss too.
- CS will open more doors and teach you more
- That seems unusual to me, at a minimum at least it shows that you're competent with a particular software/skill.  I'm a CPA and people glorify that certification.  I suppose every profession is different.
- I honestly wouldn't want to work with someone with that shitty atitude. Only people after entry level positions would list a certificate on their CV and those people don't know better yet. That's just silly gatekeeping from someone with self-confidence issues. But at the end of the day it's good. He doesn't want to work with them and I'm sure those candidates wouldn't want to work with him either so everyone's happy.
- CPA  is totally different. That's legally required for a job. Accounting and programming are very different.

What can I expect once I'm certified?

I'm planning on taking the Network+ exam later this month and plan on taking more (likely moving on to Security+) after that. What can I expect to open up for me with these? Additionally, which certifications should I work for afterwards?

A little bit about my current position: I work Help Desk at a family-owned business where there is absolutely no chance for advancement. I have worked here for a year and a half and a lot of my responsibilities are what a Junior Systems Administrator would be doing. I have a Bachelor's from a less-than-reputable school (I wish younger me did more research!) in Information Security. While several of the teachers there were amazing and I feel like I learned a lot from my time there, I feel the school's reputation is holding me back so I'm buckling down and want to get some certs under my belt so I feel like I have more legitimate experience in the eyes of recruiters and the like.

**Comments:**
- I currently have the A+ and Network+. They never really came in handy until just the other day. Had an interview and a few days later I was offered the job, which I accepted. They have a base pay rate plus $1/hour each certification (A+, Net+, Sec+). It's an extra $2/hour which is about an extra $80/week which I think is pretty good. I'm sure this isn't typical and honestly, I had a hard time finding a job. I think I just got lucky this time around.
- Don't expect much. Decent companies don't pay attention to certifications. Not only is it easy to get certified, it's also not an indicator of any sort of knowledge or potential to perform a specific job.
- No one is going to throw a bunch of money at you just because you got certified. Its good that your getting them but you need experience to backup that piece of paper. You'll likely have to take a low end job and get experience and move your way up the ladder.
- Certifications mostly help in getting past HR and as tie breakers, so to speak. A lot of people seem to be underestimating how much they factor in, though. Sure, no one is going to hire you just because you have a certification but it will make them more likely to talk to you to begin with and that's an important step. As a sort of informal study, my brother sent out 2 different versions of his resume -- one with certifications on it and one without. His call back rate for the ones that listed certifications was about 50% higher (8 of 25 versus 5 of 25). Literally the only difference between them was listing the certs.
- [deleted]
- That's not really true. Some things certainly indicate potential, like "years of job experience" indicates at least that you weren't terrible enough to get fired. Certs on the other hand just seem to indicate that you can get a cert, not any skills that translate into job performance.
- I spent about 8 years doing Help Desk stuff. I've only recently started getting certifications to back that experience up. My resume looks like crap because I've been doing this for so long, but my "Education" section is bare bones... That tells the employers that I've occupied a chair for the last 8 years and not much else (which isn't far from the truth, to be honest). Now that I'm looking for another job, I'm having to bust my butt to get certifications so I can beef up my resume and compete with folks with half the experience. Certifications aren't going to necessarily impress employers, but they're good to have because they show that you are improving on your skill set. It looks a lot better when applying for jobs that require or even prefer you to have the certifications. OP, you should find out what kind of job you want, search job postings, check the requirements and "preferred" section, then see what else you should get. If you're going the SysAdmin route, you might want to consider CCNA next. If you're sticking with Help Desk, you should get your A+ and maybe even ITIL Foundations. TL;DR: Certifications aren't always useless.

- Honestly, I was just responding to Lupa-Zalupa's statement: >Decent companies don't pay attention to certifications. Not only is it easy to get certified, it's also not an indicator of any sort of knowledge or potential to perform a specific job. I could say the same about education and experience. I just wanted to point out that his logic was flawed.
- That logic is flawed only if you think the employers treat education/experience/certifications as the same thing. They do not. That's a simple fact of life. My logic is not flawed, your understanding of the corporate world is.
- lawl ok dude. so every company treats those criteria the same? gotcha bro.
- >>That logic is flawed only if you think the employers treat education/experience/certifications as the same thing. **They do not.** >so every company treats those criteria the same? gotcha bro. Nice reading comprehension bro.
- /s that was my original point idiot.
- Was your original point that they **are** the same? Then you're wrong and have no idea how the real world operates. Was your original point that they are **not** the same? Then you incorrectly generalized my statement about certifications to everything else and are still wrong. Or maybe you don't have any point, seeing how it requires a reading comprehension and deductive reasoning, both of which you seem to be lacking.
- lol man, you're all over the place. You just really want to be right, so I'll let you have it.
