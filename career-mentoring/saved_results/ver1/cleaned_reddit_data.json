    "title": "All my IT friends discourage me (40M) from a career change to IT.",
    "content": "So, several times in my career over the years, I have contemplated a switch to an IT career. My focus would be networks and/or security. My father in an IT lifer and have several good friends in the IT field. I myself am an industry biologist. While I absolutely love science and am passionate about my work, some toxic work environments I have found myself in have pushed me to go in a different direction.  IT has always one of those things I think I could be really happy doing. I have always had a knack for understanding computers and how to troubleshoot them, I have never ventured beyond the hobbyist sort of computer nerd. I have always wanted to step up my credentials in my desired path and become a professional.\n\nEach time I try, my IT buddies are always a bit pessimistic. Before now, say about 10 years ago, the reaction was \"You will not make a lot of money starting out in IT\" and various other arguments about starting IT from the bottom. BTW, the money in biology isn't great either. But if your a science nerd like me, biological lab and field work can be rewarding. \n\nSo now, at 40, and again in a toxic environment and industry job, I am looking to make an exit and find another passion to pursue professionally. Now, my friends say that I have no chance to beat out a recent college grad with no experience for a job. The idea is that put a recent college grad with little to no xp vs a motivated 40 year old with little to no xp, HR will always go with the college grad, hands down. So it seems they are telling me that I missed the boat and stick to biology.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Would it be a waste of time to seek out some certifications and head for the nearest help desk wanted ad?\n\nEdit: Some great advice and feeling the reddit love. But want to clear up one topic. I know the money won't be anywhere near what I make now. I have an established career and some serious credentials backing up my experience currently. I am not looking for a change to make the money. I want the change to reinvigorate me. I want a job that I can learn and growth with in something new and exciting (for me). I also know that toxic work environments are everywhere. I just am just stuck in one right now and that is what is spurring the change.",

      "I'm 38, went back to school at 35 and got my associates degree in CIS/MIS. Graduated a year ago. I'm finishing up my second contracted project this month and starting my first direct hire IT role next month in desktop support. Ill be enrolling in the fall to pursue my bachelor's as well. I also have a wife and 3 kids, one of them being just 3 weeks old. \n\nThe point of that is...fuck your friends. \n\nGo for it. \n\nIf I can do it then so can you.",
      "Why do you care what your friends think? If they're not ambitious, that's their problem. You can make plenty of money as a 40 year old just starting in IT. Go for it.",
      "You have a STEM degree, you have a good story to tell, you (presumably) have a work ethic that will enable you to be successful.  Go for it.",
      "Dude what? You clearly don't like your current job much, what do you have to lose? Just do it. Also, your pay will scale very quickly with some experience.",
      "Ill play devils advocate here. I think your friends have some valid but misdirected points.\n\n1. While its not like this everywhere, there is absolutely toxic work environments/cultures in IT. Especially when I first stared in IT I had a few jobs that were based off of favoritism, there was a lot of gatekeeping by upper management, they expected us to do unpaid on-call, work holidays, stay late, etc. \n\nNot all companies are like that. Id wager most arent, but they do exist and you probably wont know until your already in it. It tends to happen in more jr roles but can happen nonetheless. Read about burnout at FAANG companies as well.\n\n2. You could leverage your experience in some ways to go into IT, but without any verifiable skills/background you could be taking a cut from where your at pay and title wise. Not always the case, but its a possibility.\n\n3. There are parts of IT that are boring. If you like doing field work, you may not like sitting in an office doing routine work.\n\n4. Understand IT, especially in the entry level area, is very oversaturated and competitive right now. Thats not to say there is no chance to break in, but there is a industry around funneling people into IT and there has been a drastic spike of people trying to get into the field especially since Covid started. Look at r/Comptia, this sub, and some other IT related subs growth over the past few years and youll see. The downside is employers see this. Youll be competing with people half your age and x2 your level of experience which can be frustrating. Being older though, you can bring a unique perspective to things. It can just take time to get in the door.\n\n5. Adding a bit to points 1 & 2. The pay can be a let down in those entry level roles. Your best bet is to get some experience then job hop to get a better salary. With that said, you could easily be in a position where you have to take a drastic pay cut just to get experience and depending on things outside of work (family, kids, living situation) this can be a downside. Very few come right into the industry and get 6 figure salaries. The majority have to climb there way up to that despite what YouTubers and tech articles will make you think.\n\nIm not saying that IT is a bad route. You can and should look at it, but be aware of what was mentioned above. Id say maybe get some certifications while you continue to work and see if you really like it. There is a huge difference between being a computer nerd and the workings of an enterprise environment. Certs can give you a brief taste of what youll be doing and what to learn.\n\nWhatever you do, best of luck! IT can be very rewarding, but I try not to see it with rose colored glasses. There are plenty of 40 year olds that switch and do okay, you can too if you put in the work. I may be biased but I think you should give it a try if youre really passionate about it. I wish you nothing but success!",
      "Sounds like you should make the move, but you left out some key information.  A career change will likely result in a salary reduction.  Entry level help desk gigs don't pay that much typically (depending on location).  Will you be able to make ends meet if your salary gets significantly reduced (at least for the first couple of years)?",
      "I think the biggest challenge is going to be convincing HR or a hiring manager that you're really looking for a career change and aren't expecting big bucks. \n\nMore often than not -- and regardless of the candidate's age -- when I've taken a chance on interviewing someone for an entry-level IT position, we hit a \"But that's less than I make now\" stumbling block that's discouraging for everyone.\n\n(Incidentally, I'm very up front about what different roles pay, but that rarely stops people from thinking that the top of the range is the floor for negotiation.)",
      "Have you considered merging your experience in Industrial Biology and Technology? The emerging field of Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning requires a high level of math, and other science backgrounds to develop, deploy, and innovate in the field of research and more. It's a combination of IT, CS, and Hard Science which you may be able to find space within and leverage your industry experience especially since it's not well established.\n\nRoles like Bioinformatics Scientist, Machine Learning, Machine Learning Scientist, Biostatistician, AI Engineer. Even if it's not in the Industrial Biology space, your understanding of hard science is a valuable tool that could potentially help you move into another role in similar salary that combines your knowledge and experience and passion, with a chance to innovate. \n\n**Some references:**\n\n* What is Machine Learning? https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/overview-what-is-azure-machine-learning\n* AWS How I Started a Career in Machine Learning - No PHD Required https://youtu.be/cC8A5VmEVtg\n* Life as an AI Researcher & Machine Learning Engineer - J.P.

      "Say you start at the bottom, learn all you can and surely you can move up. Everyone starts somewhere. You're still going to be working for another 20-25 years; that's a lot of time to be doing something you enjoy. Go get it!!",
      "So listen, if youre unhappy you have 2 choices; make a change or remain unhappy. Its that easy. Yeah, if you get into IT at helpdesk or junior admin level youll make probably around 40k give or take depending on your city/country. Not amazing but not end of the world awful. There are still bad work environments in IT and I have been part of them, but there are good ones too. If you believe IT is something youll enjoy, then go for it. :)\n\nEdit: my fat thumbs cant type on this Little Rock we tricked into thinking.",

      "I'm 30 years old. Never went to a university. However, at this age I finally found out what I want my occupation to be for the rest of my life. I want to be an archaeologist. I messed up my life. I barely finished high-school as a mechatronics technician because of physical diseases and a poor spirit I had at the time.. I've been told by a good friend of mine that I don't have a moral fortitude to make it to a university, much less to finish it. He is right.\n\nBut I don't care. I want this. I already made certain steps towards reaching that goal. Moved to a city where there is such an university. Found a job and am renting an apartment. It is a city I wanted to live in. I didn't know whether I would make it this far. I believed in the Lord that He would provide as He wishes, and today, here I am. I won't back down simply because the task seems impossible given the lack of my character and whatnot. I'll fight for it. \n\nThe point of the story, just as it was mentioned: if you really want to change your career, your life, for the better, don't listen to those who would discourage you from doing it. Hear their counsel, pick the flowers, leave the weeds; recognize your errors, evaluate your strengths, and keep pressing on! :)\n\nI wish you a successful journey. :D",
      "I live in rural Illinois, and part of what I do is teach at a small tech college. This year I had students with an AAS degree get jobs starting at $45,000 or more, and included benefits. This is not the Chicago area either, nor the best students. \n\nIf you have a passion for IT, do it.",
      "Your friends are giving you shit advice... You can easily beat out a college grad with no experience because you do have decades of real work experience. Shifting to IT isn't some magical mystery subject, it's just another professional field and learning it is just like learning anything else. Given the choice between hiring a guy with 15-20 years professional experience and no IT experience vs a 20 year old with no professional experience and no IT experience, I'm hiring the guy with professional experience every time.",
      "I career changed from Marketing to IT at the age of 38, so pretty close to you.\n\nI didn't ask for anyone's permission.\n\nNow granted I was already starting from zero (laid of in the 2008 bloodbath) stringing together multiple part-time jobs including working swing shift at Walmart, when I made the jump to IT.\n\nAre you applying for jobs and your friends are the hiring managers? Your buddies will be interviewing you? No?\n\nThen you owe it to yourself to make an effort at least. It doesn't sound like you can drop everything and start bootcamping certs, blogging your github homelab on youtube while volunteering to fix the \"IT\" at your local church like is always suggested around here. You'll have to get things dones within the context of your current career. \n\nNow, I'm not saying you should not listen to your friends. In fact, I'm curious as to why ALL of them (?) are telling you not to do it. What's left unsaid by all of them? Do they know you pretty well? Honestly that could be a bad sign, when all of them are telling you not to. Do you have a blind spot? Are they being \"nice\" and not telling you about some glaring thing they see that means IT is not in the cards for you? All of them say don't do it?\n\nCurious.\n\nAlso, you've mentioned toxic environments twice now. What are the componenets of these toxic environments that you're experiencing? It's possible that there are toxic environments in every career field. \n\nAt 40 you'll need to explore EVERY facet at hand. You, current state of your present career, current state of IT, You, future state of your present career, You, future state of IT, and mostly You....getting the picture?\n\nYou can do it. Apparently a lot of people are telling you not you, you might want to listen...and more importantly you might want to ask them some pointed questions.\n\nLike I always tell my boys, wherever you go  there *you* are. Ask tough questions, explore, plan, and I think you can do it.\n\nGood luck!",

      "My father in an IT lifer and have several good friends in the IT field. - yes change now. They can help at least provide a career plan what to learn, what jobs are best, maybe a reference or refferal etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou will not make a lot of money starting out in IT\" - yes true. Read it again if you dont believe. Do some market research and consult salaries with your biology. As I said above, consult with your contacts on possible career maps and realistic times to advance and approximate your salary earnings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n have always had a knack for understanding computers and how to troubleshoot them, - honestly a knack for googling is way more useful than whatever that \\^ implies. Im serious, googling as a netowrk engineer/noc, googling as a devops, googling as a software dev. Lots of googling and being good at it is extremely useful. So patience will be needed. YOu may have to do 10 things at once and you are tired and its been going on like this for 6 hours non stop seriously lol. You should take notes of everything so you can be on point and advance without going back or forgetting stuff. At the same time, while googling you should maintain the clearhead and focus to read in detail everything on the page because often its the random that dont seem to have the answer that may be the key to solve your query, be it they hold the answer in weird non obvious wording, or they give you an idea where to look at next. \n\nyou dont need passion. what psychopath has passion for searching cisco bugs, or kubernetes and azure. computer passionate people are probably people who build PCs and play world of warcraft and instagram. IT job is different. \n\nSometimes your ability to asses a situation logically and properly, may be asssessed while on the phone.",
      "If you love and are passionate about the work that you are currently doing then maybe a change in workplace is necessary if you feel its toxic.\n\nI wouldn't encourage you to get into IT at 40 if you still love the work that you currently do.\n\nYou may come into the field and find a different kind of toxicity. From what I've noticed, IT professionals work behind the scenes and non-IT staff don't understand or consider the challenges that IT professionals experience so we end up having to learn conflict resolution when dealing with other people, because essentially they are all having a problem if they are asking for help. People get frustrated when things don't work correctly and often times IT professionals take the brunt of that.\n\nBut if you really want to make the switch because its time for a change, then absolutely go for it. Its just fundamental knowledge that you need to get into the field. However experience & knowledge advances you so if you want to move up, you will need to learn the technical stuff. I would expect that you have picked up on some essential soft skills already that will help you move up faster.",

      "I went from doing physical security to IT. I was working a security gig and had nothing but time on my hands. I could show up to work and watch Netflix all day for 8 hours if I wanted. Right at the beginning of the pandemic, I knew I wanted to get into IT. I followed Kevtech and Jobskillshare on YouTube and followed their playlist. I mean I binged and watched it like a Netflix series. Once I felt confident, I then posted on the Nextdoor app throughout my local neighborhood Offering free IT services. I knew I was onto something big. Within minutes I had 50+ requests for various IT-related tasks. I went to Freshdesk and built out a domain so anytime I would get an email - a ticket would automatically be created and I could streamline it to the customer. In the beginning, Ive done everything from network deployments to malware removal and everything in between. I now work at a local hospital as a level 2 desktop support technician- which is my first IT job at age 31. You can do anything you put your mind to. If I can do it then quite literally anyone can. Best of luck",
      "I'd like to ask you to elaborate on your toxic work environments. What is it that's so toxic? Do you have difficulty dealing with toxic people? That may be why your friends are pushing you away from IT, dealing with toxic people is a cornerstone of this profession. You will deal with assholes having a bad day that expect you to make everything better every day. \n\nI have a friend who has social anxiety and issues and does not deal w people. He asks me if he should get into IT and I tell him no because of his inability to deal with hostile people he will match their energy and cuss people out he dgaf so he isn't cut out for this.\n\nYou don't make it sound like you are passionate about IT, it sounds like you just want to work somewhere that isn't toxic, IT will likely be MORE toxic and if that is your primary drive I'd say your friends are right and this is not a career change worth making.",

      "Better to be 40 and switching careers to one you love than 50 and burnt out and wanting to switch careers with little left in you to one that you'll enjoy but lost the passion for everything...\n\nI say do it. It's a great career, and although the entry level pay and responsibilities can be crap, you can easily move up. Just don't get in that rut to where if you do the job you'll move up. You have to be very proactive. Learn new things outside of your job description, ask the next level tier stuff and take on some of their work if possible. Just keep trying to move forward and it comes pretty quickly. \n\nIf you get into IT and don't like it, you still have a good background in biology. If you still enjoy biology and IT, there's some parts of the field that intersect (different then The Intersect, which Chuck used).",

Good luck if you do make a change.",
      "Im 39. No IT degree just criminal justice. Just got an entry lvl network admin job. \n\nIt can be done bro. If you want it go for it. Yea the pay might suck for 2 years but so what.",
      "First off, eveyone has a shot of making it in any given position. The only thing that matters is professionalism and experience. If you're looking to get into the industry then an entry level help desk position or entry level tech position is a good place to start. If you're going to try any IT job then you gotta stay hungry. Don't get comfortable. You're there to learn on the job while continuing your education for about a year or two. If you don't have it then the A+ cert is a good place to start. The cert will give you more weight during the application process, it also tells employers that you understands the fundamentals of how a computer works and how to troubleshoot issues. If you're set on getting into networking then you can get your Network + cert and then the CCNA cert. Some may say to just go straight to the CNNA but that depends on your knowledge of how networking works. You can think of the Network + cert as a per-algebra class, it lays the ground work and fundamentals of networking.",
      "I'm 43.  Went back to school at 38 and graduated at 41 with an Associate's in Information Technology.  I worked for an ISP for 14 years and developed some good foundational knowledge of networks and troubleshooting.  I landed my first MSP job a year ago last March then left for a Systems Admin position this past December.  \n\nYou can do this.  You're not too old.  Depending on what you make, it may be a cut at first, but a solid 5 years plan of learning and obtaining certifications could out you in the 6 figure range no problem.  If it makes you happy, nothing anyone says should make a damn bit of difference.  Go for it.",
      "It's never a waste of time to try to better yourself and your situation.\n\nYou are in a difficult position in terms of having a certain salary level to maintain, the flood of recent IT graduates and blue-collar workers who've been convinced IT is an easy upgrade. \n\nMy suggestion to someone who already has a college degree and a career is to leverage that.  Find a way to work some practical IT experience into your current job and/or explore your field/industry for IT opportunities.  If it doesn't develop into a position, it can at least put some practical experience on your resume. \n\nCan't speak to biology as I'm unfamiliar with the field, but I might advise a sales guy to put together business analytics projects and build that into an IT analytics specialty.  Sometimes there's specialized equipment that has an IT component that you can build expertise in, or maybe you can build web based applications for your department that could lead toward a web dev position. \n\nI know I'm being a bit vague, but to me that's the best path for someone who already has a degree and familiarity with an industry.",
      "I'm 38 and am going back to school for an IT-related degree after several interviews for entry-level positions went disastrously because they were looking at my (unrelated to IT) degrees and laser-focusing on that instead of seeing that I used to teach what was basically A+ material as part of a job assistance program. I'm totally okay with the inevitable pay cut but I totally get what you mean. I'll be over 40 once I finish and female on top of that. \n\nI'm still going to give it a shot with some certs and a bachelor's degeee. At least I'll have my current career to fall back on if it doesn't work out but I'm kicking myself for not pursuing it the first time around like I'd wanted to.",

But those new grads can lose out to experienced people, and those experienced people lose to those with a degree AND experience.\n\nJob offers are usually contingent upon you being the best candidate who interviewed. But there's more to it than credentials, and there IS an appeal to having mature people in your office rather than all kids. \n\nYou CAN get into IT. You CAN make good money. There will always be better candidates out there. But they won't always be in the same place at the same time. Sometimes, you'll be the best pick.",

Diversity maintains the success and creativity in any field",

Took Core 1 (twice) passed on my second try in October 2021. Passed Core 2 and got my A+ certification February 2022.  Now, I'm about to start my entry level job at Amazon as an IT Support Associate II. I went full circle in a way.\n\nI belong to the hotel service industry field for 25 years. My IT experience in the business is good enough for me to be categorized as \"my IT experience\" where 25% of daily operations I deal with IT related issues.  I realized the demands of the job working as a Hotel General Manager moving-on will be too much for me (the stress oh my!), as the job itself is going from bad to worst. So I decided to get into IT and I am fortunate to be given a job offer by Amazon.  It is an entry level position, but I am confident and motivated that in about 1-2 years IT experience and the more certs achieved I'll be able to move up and level-up. \n\nDon't listen to your friends.

      "I think you should chance it. Build the life you want. I started selling real estate in 2015, prior to that I was a wanna-be because of all sorts of reasons. Plainly I just didn't have the cajones. Everyone told me, \"No, don't do it,\" and I also had my own fear of failure. So I started part-time. All I cared about was to cover my costs, and making money was a bonus! \n\nNow, I make enought to cover costs AND go on trips AND put away a few bucks for a rainy day. In hindsight it was the best decision. I still have the day job, but it is just a job. Yes it provides PTO, insurance, and all those other benefits, but it still is just a job. When my peers get negative around me I tell them about real estate. Lol, kills the coversation every time. \n\nAnother childhood dream was to be an IT guy too. In 2019 I started down that rabbit hole too. It has been slower because I didn't stay forcused and I like plinking on tryhackme and watching Network Chuck and Health Adams. In February I got my Net+, and working on my Sec+ now. \n\nMy goal is to combine my sales skills with IT as a sales engineer - that is my sweet spot imo.

People calling about their problems. Network Admin? people on your network calling about their problems. Cyber Security? People calling about problems you made and now you have to fix them. Developers? Executives giving you more problems.\n\nDon't get me wrong though. I'm a problem solving type of guy and I don't mind it. But again, most people with a problem are not having a good day. IT can get toxic, really fast.\n\nIf you decide to go with it, get some certs and do it while keeping your current job. Build a home lab to get familiar with things.

You will go further faster given you have understanding of the field and how to best support their objectives from an IT perspective.  When I used to run a small team of field service techs for researchers, I would have loved to have someone with your background, even perhaps being 15 years older than other starters.\n\nAnother gambit is if you know if your current workplace orders software/hardware from certain IT vendors.  They sometimes are interested in taking on entry level IT sales roles to people who know how the org operates and what the business needs are vs. some 20 year IT guy who knows more Cisco commands than how to get a researcher to buy products.\n\nOverall I just think its good to find value/use in your current experience, even if you are moving to IT, instead of just starting from scratch.",

Then to show that you have some knowledge or proficiency in a more specialized area.  Generalist types can find jobs - but specialization in IT is what gets you paid.  \n\nDepending on the organization - moving up can be easy or impossible (at least with actual titles and pay raises).  Smaller orgs you can \"cap out\".  Lots of places are looking to underpay.

For sure, no way around that. Especially at your age. 40 is still young, but it doesn't matter what the crowd says lol. What does your body tell you when you get up in the morning and your bones are literally talking out loud to you. Sounding like a bowl of rice crispies just walking to the bathroom lol.\n\nIn your 20's, all-nighters and studying for 18+ hours a day wasn't a big deal. But try doing that NOW. I'm only 32, and if I miss just an hour of sleep I'm basically a zombie the next day. I know everybody wants to sound tough and say it's not that hard but lets be real here. Then on top of all that you have to account for family time and other life responsibilities. \n\nYES - There is a lot of money in IT IF you're willing to put in that kind of work, and not give up.\n\nYES - it can be rewarding if you like tech (only in certain fields though).\n\nYES - IT jobs can be pretty secure depending on what you pursue. \n\nBut again it really comes down to what you're capable, and willing to do in order to get there. \n\nThe only times I'd actively discourage it is if: \n\n1: You're not a driven person, you'll get nowhere in IT as it's heavily driven by the workers work ethics. If you're lazy, you're not gonna go anywhere unless you know someone. Tech isn't really something you can \"fall\" into. You have to search it out, make yourself competitive, and apply yourself on some level. \n\n2: If you're not wiling to learn with the evolving industry. Tech is one of the most evolving fields in the world, what you learn today has a chance to be completely irrelevant tomorrow. So if you want one of those \"sit in my chair and watch YouTube all day\" kind of jobs, either become a network engineer, or stay away. Even low end entry level Help Desk jobs do more work then that and deal with evolving tech.\n\n\\--------------------------\n\nTLDR; \n\nIf you're doing it for personal reasons, then go for it!

      "Man, and here I am sitting at 40-years-old in IT and think about making a switch to something else like being a groundskeeper!",
      "Theyre probably (mostly) concerned about the pay cut you would take.\n\nYoure in your 40s, and presumably, well into your career.  If one of my friends (were upper 30s) said they were going to jump from their career paths and get into ITwell, Id hope they have all their ducks in a row.  \n\nIm upper 30s and six figures.  Some of the guys that have entered our company are under $25 an hour, entry level.  \n\nJust be prepared.  And, I wouldnt fault your friends much.  Im guessing (again) that theyd be concerned about the money aspect more than anything.",
      "I got in at 25 an earned shit for about 4 years, jumped to a \"good\" salary at that point, and now 7 years in I'm on a well above average salary.\n\nThe main things you need are:\n\n- Ambition\n- A willingness to learn and actually do the hard work. You will need to play around with tech at home, work likely won't train you into a high earning role so it's up to you to obtain those skills independently\n- A smart and strategic view of your career map. Lots of people are good at tech, but to really be successful you can't rely on luck alone. You need to view your career strategically - if you take X job you can learn skills Y and Z which are in demand for the job youd like to have in 2 years time, etc. For your first job it won't matter so much but for every subsequent job you should be looking at this",
      "Why not just get another job in your field, do you have a college degree?",
      "I studied microbiology in university and wound up working for a genetics research complex, you make no money in the field if you dont pursue medicine typically.\n\nMade the change to IT, got my bachelors, did help desk for 6 months, then landed a cybersecurity analyst position. Had my 2nd interview for hopefully my first ever pentration testing job today.\n\nYou can go far in this field in short tine. Your friends are right, the money in entry level IT sucks. The key is to minimize your time in entry IT through hard work and continued education.",
      "You can change, and its your life, do what you want.  However changing careers at 40 can and will be difficult because you have to learn a whole bunch of info that may not be applicable everyday.\n\nMoney will come back and if you can tolerate the temporary financial set back, then youll be fine.",
      "Unless you got solid skills already just know youre starting from the bottom rungs of the ladder - which dont pay well and can be pretty hellish. \n\nGet some certs before diving in. \n\nAge doesnt mean jack in IT - competency does.",
      "I mean they're right about the money starting out, help desk isn't great pay. Tbh though, I'm 6 months in and enjoying it a lot more than I thought.\n\nThere's upsides and downsides, and like every industry, everyone in it likes to talk shit about it lol. Don't think it'll be the answer to all your problems, but you can definitely do it if you want. There's some ageism, but it's kinda reversed if you want to get in the management side lol\n\nIn short: entry level pay bad, but entry level job is definitely attainable at your age, do what you wanna do",
      "Money isn't the problem, the problem people have in IT is they have no passion for it. If money is the main goal of a career then you'll be miserable. That should never be the focus. Entry level IT jobs are decent around like 40 - 60k. Past that it can go up to 100k in some jobs, there are also a minority of jobs in IT that make at least 150k. But again, money should never be the goal at all. You can make a lot but end up hating the job. If you have no passion for IT and just want to do it cause every fucking person is doing IT (pun intended) then don't enter the field. This field is saturated because everyone is greedy and just wants to earn a lot of money and not learn shit in the field then they'll eventually fail and whine and complain that IT is bad. Its a field not for everyone. You have to have a desire to learn and keep learning till the day you retire. If you don't have that ability then don't enter the field because this is a field that is constantly evolving and growing till the end of this universe. Take several IT courses and learn stuff.\n\n If it doesn't interest you and something that bores you then forget IT you won't thrive in the field. Plan ahead, don't plan while you're doing something in IT. I think more than half of the people in IT are miserable and failing at their jobs because they have no interest in the field and are disappointed they aren't becoming a millionaire or something. This field is also a field that weeds people out very easily. If you don't know your shit and don't prepare enough, you won't get anywhere. If you have the dedication, passion and interest for IT then you'll be fine, if not then don't bother.",
      "If you are good at it could be rewarding, otherwise you're gonna be setting up computers for chump change. You know yourself better than reddit so what do you think?",
      "How important is a degree? Is there ever a point where experience trumps a degree?",
      "Your friend is speaking in absolutes that are not absolutely true. Yes its possible you could hit some speed bumps but it doesnt have to mean theres no hope. 2 of my last 3 hires were older than me at 40, 1 of them having left a different career and knowing he would take a pay cut. Oh and he has since gotten his sec+ and promoted into a junior cyber analyst role. \n\nThat guys experience? A little equivalent to geek squad 20 years prior and he a new online degree focused on database while working his other job.",
      "Wowsie, I guess the grass is always greener. I'd love a science job!!\n\nIT, IMO, feels kinda dead end to be honest - I always feel that I yearn for more, i'd love to be in something bigger. In my experience IT is obviously service based, the hidden backbone that's taken for granted until it fails.. It does sometimes just feel like groundhog day \"same shit, different day\", not actually creating something. Obviously this is all my experience, take with a pinch of salt, still valid nonetheless, regardless of what anyone says - We all have our own experience and opinions on working in this field.\n\nIt has its moments where you do a great job and remember why you chose IT, as some wizard...",
      "What do your friends know about what you have achieved and what knowledge you have?  Just go for it and give it a shot. With your science background, you will do fine.",
      "I think this is a perfect opportunity to prove your friends wrong. If your really passionate about this I say go for it and try your best. \n\nIf your passionate enough, you will surpass them in no time.",
      "All of my IT friends have said go for it! Most of my online 'research says go for it. Just on reddit there are so many stories about savvy folks changing from a totally non-IT field and getting in the mix at noob positions or pivoting from the experience they have.\n\n\nI am on my 2nd short term help desk gig this year after selling cell phones for years. I started studying for Network+ last fall but I haven't gotten any cert so I tell interviewers I'm a noob but my studying let's me not sound like a poser, just a novice. I positioned my customer contact and previous call center time to get my foot in the door. I'm 55.",
      "Youre never too old to make a career switch. If you want to do it and you think it will bring a lot of positive change in your life then do it. \n\nBut I will say, if you feel like you are in a toxic work environment. Then apply for other positions in your field first! It may be possible that you find a fulfilling job with great coworkers, AND good pay within your field. A career change is a big step so definitely think it through. \n\nBest of luck.",
      "Yes you should switch to IT.  Long ago honestly.  Yes you should follow your passion and get in IT.  Even at 40yrs old you can grow exponentially.  If the world of IT is a hotel - IT people are on different floors such is there perspective shaped relative to the floor they are on.  Take a few classes and get a cert.  start off doing contracting work since youre not too concerned about the money.  The fastest way to grow is contract work W2 or 1099.  Turn that fear into your power and get out there.  Start living."

I was at 32k to start.\n\nWas promoted a year and a half later to an Analyst doing setups for them at 33.5k.\n\nLeft that job after a year and went to work an entry level helpdesk role at a MSP for 35k.\n\nMoved up over the next 4.5 years to 70k. Was doing a mix of remote and on-site support for a helpdesk and as an engineer.\n\nJust accepted an offer for 100k on a fully remote role doing Windows product support.\n\nI don't have a degree and only had my CompTIA trifecta(A+, Network+,and Security+).\n\nI just took everything that I could learn and wasn't scared to take new things. \n\nIf you have technical aptitude and the desire to learn, you will go far with the right company. \n\nHope this helps!",
      "1. Yes, it is possible.\n\n2. I work as a cloud engineer for a CSP (cloud service provider). I started out working in-person, and then the job transitioned to a fully remote role during the pandemic. I am now 100% remote. I started working as a help desk technician (though my work was more akin to remote desktop support) at 26, with no certifications or prior experience in IT. (I studied for the A+ and went through most of the Google IT Support professional certification prior to my interview, but I did not have these certifications when I got the job.) Ive since been promoted multiple times and have escaped the dreaded phone/chat queues.\n\n3. I work 40 hours per week, Monday through Friday. I have occasional on-call work (one week every 3-4 months).\n\nI agree with one of the other commenters that working remote full-time in IT will be difficult to do if youre also trying to juggle childcare at the same time. Although you would be working from home, you would still be working a full-time job. There is no way to perform both roles well simultaneously. Your work will suffer, and you wont be able to give full-attention to your child.\n\nYou would be half-assing both roles.\n\nI dont think IT is the career youre looking for if youre hoping to find a remote job that you can juggle with caring for your daughter. Something else in tech, like a freelance dev job (where you set your own hours and/or work a contract for a finished product vs. working on a team with set full-time hours) might allow you to work a more flexible schedule. It would be very hard to break in to that kind of job without any experience though. \n\nGood luck with finding a job that allows you to live the dream.",
      "It is definitely doable but it will be difficult. 29 years old really isnt that late to the game, its more the issue of trying to break into the industry in a full remote capacity without any degree or relevant experience. \n\nTo succeed what I would recommend is skippping the generic IT route (systems administrator style positions) and trying to get straight into a specialized junior position like DevOps or Security. \n\nI would start with some AWS certifications. Study and learn and see if it interests you. Certs are a great way to get something on your resume when you have no experience or degree. They absolutely will not guarantee you a job but they can definitely help and theyre a great learning opportunity.",
      "Started my IT career at 59 after a 40 career in the restaurant business.  Took a certificate program at My Computer Career and landed a tier 1 position with the FDA.  Work from home, great benefits and a security clearance!  You can do it",
      "Honest Question - Do you like IT, and do you consider yourself technically savvy in your personal life ?  If not, I wouldn't pursue it.  The good thing about IT is that you can jump into it at any age if you start and keep up with training because it changes so fast.  The bad thing about IT is that it changes fast and requires a lot of upkeep.\n\nThe key to working from home is finding the right culture.  There are other positions directly and indirectly with IT that can support working from home \\*IF\\* the company culture allows it.\n\nProject Management / Business Analyst - These roles work from home as they mostly involve meeting with people to understand and get updates.  (PM Role could be tricky, but if it's an IT based PM Role, working from home is doable)\n\nCorporate Procurement  / Supply Chain - Again, easy to work from home, somewhat lower barrier to entry if making a carrier change.  Again, can be focused on IT if you want as well.  My organization has IT Procurement people within the larger procurement org because IT procurement can be complicated especially when it comes to licensing.\n\nThe key to the above, in my opinion, is finding a large, preferably multi-national, organization that has figured out work from home during covid so you're not pressured to come back because of lack of bodies in the building.  (Smaller companies)",
      "I think you will find that most if not all jobs start on-site before allowing remote. Even more so if you have no IT Background nor degree, nor certificates (which would be a good thing to have before starting IT; at least some basic cert).\n\nI think you have the same or better chances working remote for an architecture office, than IT without any background or experience, honestly.",
      "Yesssss!!\n\nI am 34 and while I was on unemployment from covid (formerly in the events industry, so those all shut down last year) I passed the 2 tests it takes to get the CompTIA A+ certification, one of the best foundational certificates you can get.\n\nI am now about 6 months into my first IT help desk job. I work in southern California, was offered a $50,000/yr salary. I have no former IT experience and no college degree.\n\nIt's 9:32am and I'm working from my bed right now.\n\nI'm not fully remote, but my boss said as long as there isn't stuff to do in the office physically, I can work from home whenever I want.\n\nWeekends and holidays off is something I've never experienced before... it's amazing to have a weekly routine as I am about to be 35 years old next week.\n\nFeel free to ask me anything! Honestly it was the best decision I ever made and I wouldn't say it was a difficult thing to do at all. Definitely check out r/CompTIA",
      "You totally can, most people start on the help desk or come with a heavily defined skillset backed up by certs/a defined github project page. It depends how quickly you need a job and how much foolishness you can tolerate (you'll probably start on a helpdesk).  Certs will help you climb your way up the ladder, as would being able to code (but you have to reinforce whatever you learn, daily preferably). Unless you want to work for the government College isn't a giant help to actually getting a job in IT.

      "Never tell any employer that you want to take care of your daughter while working. That means you want to work, but you also have a bigger priority 100% of the time. \n\nPersonally I don't advise don't this at all. Your job might not even let you, and if you get caught trying to care for a child during your work day you could be fired. \n\nAs a mother I'm sure you already know this but childcare is a full time job.",
      "I'm a dev and work remote full time. Different work, obviously.\n\nHowever, since I got the remote job, it's become abundantly clear to me that there really isn't any way you can work from home and take care of your daughter. One of your responsibilities is going to suffer.\n\nI can tolerate the occasional interruption to answer the door, or take a personal phone call, but anymore than that and my productivity hits the floor.\n\nThis applies to the whole \"digital nomad\" lifestyle as well. Sure, I can go to Bali and work, but now I'm in paradise, stuck staring at a laptop screen, indoors, for 8 hours of the day. I'm also on a different time zone than the rest of my team so I'd be getting up at 2am for meetings.\n\nIf your job is to write news articles or some other social media type job(traditional nomad jobs), then I imagine you can make it work. For it/dev jobs that require critical thought, focus, a comfortable workstation etc, it's just not feasible\n\nIt's not just the time off task either, it's the time it takes to get back on task.\n\nIf you're not disciplined enough or not able to work undistracted, working from home will be detremental to your career and ruin remote work for the rest of us.\n\nTons of remote people aren't half as productive as they think they are because they are constantly interrupted.",
      "I have a degree in IT related field, but I want to chip in still.  \n\n\nNone of my job interviews even mentioned my studies or what I actually learned there. So this is not important at all. All employers cared about is what am I doing now and what do I know. This, in first interview can be tested by asking simple related questions to the job, and of course on second interview it's tested by some sort of assignment. So this is what determines if you get a job or not.  \n\n\nI was working full time at the office, but as pandemic hit, March 2020, our company went remote, and still haven't returned.   \nhowever, I recently had some talks, because I am switching jobs. Most of them now offer fully remote or semi-remote roles, with 1/2 days in the office if you are needed.   \nNow I got an offer from company with ability to work fully remote. They have office which is quite far for me and not feasible to commute. So this was quite big point in my talking to company.  \n\n\nI seen some HR on YouTube mentioning that you should not ask this question on the interview, but you most definitely should do and set your lines. If company doesn't want you because you want to work remote, do you really want to join that company?  \n\n\nAbout working hours, my country is 40h/week 8-17, with 1h lunch (some companies have less restrictive guidelines as the one I work now is 8-17 / 9-18 etc., as long as you do the work)   \nBut if you plan to be unavailable in certain times, I think it's worth mentioning too, and talk it out with employer, but this is not that important in my eyes, as you can do your job more flexible and in other hours.",
      "I started at 28, no degree. Just signed up to a company that helps you move into IT. They dumped a bunch of courses on me, I studied, they partnered with recruitment agencies and now I'm a systems administrator for a mid sized company.\n\nLoving it!!!!\n\nI started remote in February and only now going back into studio.\nI work around the school runs which is great, the companies I've been with were flexible which is great. I start at 9 and finish at 5:30\n\nYou should do it if you like computers, but it is a lot of work!",

Pick up a programming language. Get good at it. That'll be the fastest and most effective route. You can pivot programming skills into A LOT of fields. A javascript or PHP developer can earn some good money and work remotely. The downside is being a developer requires focus and being in an environment where you can think without being disturbed. You will need to juggle paying attention to your daughter and committing large chunks of time to being away from her and focusing on other things.\n\nIf there is one thing I wish I knew what to do before getting start is get some programming chops. It goes a LONG ways.",
      "Yes, it is very possible. I started in my late twenties in service desk with having just the A+ cert, and have since moved to infrastructure. I work 37.5h/week (UK based). \n\nI think you might find it a little difficult to find entry level jobs that are fully remote.

I applied for over 76 jobs, and netted one interview which got one of my life goals down, getting out of retail. \n\nMy advice would be to pursue the Comp TIA A+ Certification. You'd be ahead of the bunch to be netted an interview, and if you have transferrable skills, apply that too!\n\n40 hours a week, 10-7.

That will allow you to skip helpdesk and tier 2 roles and go straight into devops/network engineering/security/Linux or whatever you like that pays well. If you took general credits during your time studying architecture they will most likely transfer to other schools.

I found my current job and change my role from helpdesk-based to project-based.\n\nI think it may be easier to find remote-based jobs now due to COVID, a lot of companies haven't kept their offices.\n\nHaving your first IT job remote-based may be a bit trickier. We are currently trying to hire some junior second-line roles and are struggling as they need to be able to hit the ground running with very little training, as it's quite hard to train remotely, so not sure if many fully remote first-line jobs exist.\n\nIn terms of the working week, I start at 09:30 am and finish at 6 pm with an hour lunch break at some point 5 days a week, I never do any work out of those hours and my company never contracts anyone, not in work hours. But it's quite flexible I am able to help my wife throughout the day with the dog and baby, as long as I don't have too many meetings, which I just couldn't do in an office.\n\nI really don't think I could go back to working fully in the office at all.",

      ">Does anyone have a remote IT job without a degree and/or with a late start (e.g. career change)?\n\nMany do.  E.g. since COVID-19 my job is thus far been almost entirely remote ... only been to the office two times over that entire period ... that might change, ... but thus far for most in tents and purposes it's \"remote only\" ... though that may change ... and some of my peers have gone officially and totally remote only - notably moving so far away that remote only is required.\n\nI also know someone who, in their 50s, a B.S. degree and in a hard science from decades earlier, but not at all IT/Engineering/Computer/Information related - they switched careers - also from something not at all IT - and are now 100% remote, and are in fact in the process of moving where they'll have to be 100% remote only.\n\n>best option if I want to work remotely\n\nMaybe ... maybe not.  Communication costs are cheap.  Consequently there's potentially always risk of who will do it for the cheapest anywhere on the planet.  But legal and other considerations may often limit that ... at least somewhat - but not entirely ... and even within a single country that might matter, as cost of living and compensation may vary greatly within a single country.  Will employer pay same regardless of employee's location ... or not at all.  Practices vary a lot by employer.  It may be a few years before that mostly settles out and we see what becomes \"the norm\".  I think in the meantime a lot of employers - and employees - are still figuring it out and \"experimenting\" with it.  Time will tell.  Likewise with the remote/not/mix ... who knows how that settles out, and may vary a lot by employer, position, nature of work, etc. ... and maybe even down to individual employees - who works better more efficiently remote vs. not ... or even based on what their tasks of the day may be.\n\n>earn money while taking care of my daughter at home\n\nWell, work is work - don't expect you'll necessarily be taking care of your daughter *and* working at the same time ... but in a lot of cases remote work may offer more flexibility on timing and such, and might be able to more-or-less keep an eye on your daughter, take breaks with her ... lunch ... way shorter commutes, etc.  But you probably won't be full time watching her *and* working *at the same time*.\n\n>BUT I know the reality is often far from what you imagine\n\nYeah, thoroughly research it before you dive in.  Many just think naive stuff like, \"Oooh, bit 'o training with some certs or code camp or whatever, maybe few months to half a year's experience ... easy 6 figure or more, just sit by computer, look at screen, type some stuff in once in a while - count me in!\".  And many will be highly disappointed that it ain't that easy.  The body of knowledge one will need to know and master to get compensation in/around that range is quite non-trivial - can easily be compared to getting a strong B.S. degree from a good school in a solid IT program.  'Bout the damn fastest I've ever seen someone make such a change took them about 1 to 1.5 years of vigorous solid full-time self-study to break into IT - going without job that whole time so they could focus on learning the skills they needed to learn to get into IT ... and then from there took 'em about 1.5 years to be solidly into 6 figure range ... but this was not your typical individual, this was someone not only highly motivated, but damn smart and fast on the uptake.  So ... that person would probably be about your top 2% or higher of typical career change folks jumping into IT.  Most take more like about 4 to 6 or more years on average to do what that person did in around 3.  And many will never make it.  Many will get into entry level positions in IT that are close to minimum wage ... and 4 ... 5 ... 6 or more years later, they'll be griping her on r/ITCareerQuestions about how they can't get ahead and are still where they started ... not everyone is up for the challenges.\n\n>Is it possible to have a remote IT job without a degree and/or with a late start?\n\nAbsolutely.  E.g. see example cited further above ... and implied caveats.\n\n>If you are one of them, what career do you have and how do you achieve it?\n\nThere's example person I cited above.  Their position is approximately - functional description - DevOps / Linux sysadmin / \"Engineer\\*\".\n\nThere's also myself ... career, I think I'd describe it as DevOps / Linux sysadmin - how I achieved it - much longer path ... basically had fair bit of electronics/engineering background ... but no degree.  After a while got my foot in the door with IT.  Always continued to *also* learn a lot on my own.  So, between my own stuff, and work experience, over time progressed to role that was primarily UNIX sysadmin, and continued to grow and progress from there ... Linux, DevOps, etc. - with lots of relevant skills along the way, e.g. out-program and out-automate most of my typical peers - but definitely not all of all of the time on everything.  Also, most of the time I've got much deeper and more thorough knowledge of Linux and most networking matters than most of my peers most of the time - again not all of them on everything all of the time.  So, anyway, I'm well able to use and leverage those skills - and they're quite valuable to my employers ... and I continue to grow and develop my skills.  It's not like you just learn it and you're done.\n\n>How many hours do you work / week? And what is your day like?\n\nBasically full time - hours usually approximately reasonably close to 40 ... as a general rule I try to keep it fairly sane - like under 45 hrs./wk. - it's not like you can get that time back later - life and other stuff continues to move right along - with or without you.  I've sometimes worked weeks in excess of 100 hours ... but those were rather extreme and mostly pretty short-term exceptions.  Have had some jobs that got too out-of-hand-too regularly.  One such job, they wouldn't back down - I gave notice and left ... and in that case rather than the customary 2 weeks notice, I gave 'em 80 working hours notice - seemed most highly fitting and appropriate under the circumstances.\n\nAlso, most IT positions will involve some on-call.  Depending mostly upon and employer and mangers and such, that can be quite reasonable and not at all too burdensome.  Or it can be totally out-of-control time to find another job.  I've turned down at least one job that had on-call requirements that were pretty much nuts - oncall half of all time, with a 10 minute leash - f\\*ck that - not living my life like that.\n\nDay like ... well, alas, this got too long, so ... splitting it ... remainder will be in [my reply comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/pfr85q/does_anyone_have_a_remote_it_job_without_a_degree/hb751k3/) to this.\n\nEdit - and edited to link the reply comment",

And what is your day like?\n\nOof, extremely varied. I'd say it is usually pretty chill if I need to go to an appointment I go, if I want to get lunch I go, etc. however if shit hits the fan I've had points where I was working pretty much 24 hours per day for quite a few days in a row with sleep breaks. Not sure how this schedule would work with kids being in the picture if that is what you're asking. Also you will almost certainly be expected to be on-call unless you're working in a LCOL country that doesn't allow it and get your work via an MSP.",
      "How is your English? Please dont take this the wrong way trying to give you an honest answer. If its not 110% clear you are going to have a difficult time finding anything in remote support, Ive seen native English speakers turned away from over the phone jobs like remote IT support just because they had a thick accent and they were pretty desperate for help. These remote IT support jobs are all basically customer service over the phone so its imperative that you are easily understandable to frustrated people. Sadly because so many jobs like this are outsourced companies in the US want people with clear US accents so not to be misconstrued for an overseas support line. \n\nNow as for starting your IT career go get the A+ to show that you know something about computers, that is all I had with my first job and its really not hard especially if you user Professor Messors free videos.\n\nGood luck to you!",

I'm worried that I made the wrong choice. I've been working in the kitchen for 10+ years, and during the pandemic I realized that I needed to find a more stable career. I've been in school as a computer information systems major/ minor statistics  because I initially wanted to pursue a field related to data. I've never even heard of data science befofe 2020 lol. But I found about cybersecurity, and from all the youtubers/dept of labor statistics, it seemed like this is a field that will grow tremendously and would be a stable career choice.It also seemed more accessible to older 2nd career adults. I took some elective classes for cybersecurity(networking/ aws) and I've been studying to get certifications. But now Im just seeing way too many people getting laid off and unable to get back in. I just don't want to waste my time.. im about to hit my mid 30s and I don't want to invest all this time and money to later be unemployed and still in the kitchen. So, for those working in the field, do you think this field will continue to stay like this...will it get worse or better?Also, Im kind of tired of hearing people say do it if it's your passion..don't do it for the money. I was watching an interview with one of the popular cybersec youtuber and even he was talking about how he personally know talented people who have been laid off and unemployed for months! \nHe said something along the lines of how they're able stay positive because it's their passion or whatever. But I've realized after trying to pursue my passion in pastry, in the end I chose stability over passion. And yes, I know I won't be making bank in this field, but having been paid shit money for the past 10 years and seeing the financial limits in the culinary field, simple livable income and room for growth is enough for me. Any input is appreciated and thank you for reading if you read all of this!",

      "I'm in the same boat as you. Over 50, this is my second career after 20 years bartending, after 12 years of freelance web design.\n\nCurrently working a pretty decent, remote help desk position (with no certs or previosu help desk experience). Just passed my Sec+, and looking to move into Security.\n\nHere's what I know so far...\n\n* When I look on Linked In, there are MANY security related jobs including SOC L1 and above.\n* Security is a general term with dozens of not hundreds of positions that cover anywhere from SOC, Pentesting, Governance-Risk-Compliance, Budgeting and economics, OSINT investigation...I mean the sky is literally the limit. So many ways to go. Personally love OSINT and want to see what I can do with it.\n* Just getting a Sec+ (or any cert) doesn't mean recruiters will be knocking down your door. You have to put the fundamentals on top of it to get a decent SOC job. TryHackMe and HackTheBox have some pretty good SOC related courses.\n* When I started my web design business, it was 2008. Everyone and their mother was trying to be a web designer back then. It was saturated. On top of that,  the world economy was shit. But I knew there were still people out there with money, and I was specializing in a specific thing and there was a need. Starting a business is hard, and there's NEVER a perfect time or perfect economy.   I made it work by becoming a better option and marketing myself well. I feel the same way about this. I need to become a better candidate than the average applicant with nothing but certs.\n\nAbout all that \"passion\" shit. I HATE that word now. If I wanted to follow my passion, I'd be a house music DJ and professional bourbon sampler at a beachside bikini and buffalo wing bar.\n\nI like IT and technology  in general. I like learning about it. Many things about it fascinates me and it seems I have a pretty good aptitude for it and learning new things. I've spent hours watching keynotes just because I find the shit interesting. I watch tech shows and podcasts more than streaming shows and movies. As far as things I would do for money, I think this is pretty awesome and it has opportunity.\n\nIf I wasn't doing this for a living, I'd still probably dabble with my home lab, and learn how to do stuff out of curiosity, but is it my passion? As in would I do it for someone else for free just because I love it so much? F\\*ck no. I'm here to make money. I will do and learn and become what I need to be to make that money..same as when I was a bartender. I loved tending bar. It was fun, I was living in Vegas and living like a true degenerate. It was great. But the money is part of what made it great.  I became the bartender I needed to be, and moved to where I needed to move, to make maximum money and have maximum fun.\n\nI see this (any job) the same way.  What do I need to do to be that guy that employers are looking for, and beat out the competition for that job, and then be able to kick ass and back it up?  Great, I'll do that.\n\nCould I do that for any job? Nope. I like this one.",
      "Infosec is not a 9 - 5 job.\n\nIt typically takes a tremendous amount of work and dedication to get into it in the first place and a lot of effort to progress because the stakes are so high.\n\nFirst read this:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/zrd5c7/roadmap\\_to\\_careers\\_in\\_cybersecurity\\_and\\_cloud/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/zrd5c7/roadmap_to_careers_in_cybersecurity_and_cloud/)\n\nThen this:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/12fwatv/comment/jfia9le/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/12fwatv/comment/jfia9le/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)",
      "**edit for perspective**  30 year veteran of systems engineering (OS2--> Windows --> Linux) and now Solutions Architect \n\nIt's not that the money isn't important, but the primary question everyone who considers Infosec FAILS to ask themselves is \"What do I love to do\"? \n\nIn my experience (non-infosec by CHOICE) there are two primary roles for Infosec experts at most enterprisees.\n\n1.  Triage - Fighting fires\n2.  Audit and Nag (God this is a thankless job where you're setup to fight ALL DAY)\n\nNEITHER of these is why I joined IT.  I have a passion for creating solutions for a business using technology.  New solutions doing amazing things.  I'll NEVER consider an infosec carrer, but applaud those for whom it's their passion.  \n\nSo OP.... What's your passion?\n\nG~",
      ">Also, Im kind of tired of hearing people say do it if it's your passion..don't do it for the money. I was watching an interview with one of the popular cybersec youtuber and even he was talking about how he personally know talented people who have been laid off and unemployed for months! He said something along the lines of how they're able stay positive because it's their passion or whatever. But I've realized after trying to pursue my passion in pastry, in the end I chose stability over passion.\n\nI respect this and I think you *can* make it with this attitude, BUT a big piece of cyber security is trying to solve a problem and thinking outside the box to get there. It has been my experience that those who are there for the money tend to lack in this skill. You might find yourself being passed up if you don't take this part seriously. \n\nAs for the stability of the career field, it's growing in every country I've heard of and there is a global shortage. I know people are being laid off, but honestly I just recently changed jobs and did not have issues doing so. There are rumblings that the US intends to make cyber security a national focus, which will grow the field even more and possibly prompt other countries to follow suit.",
      "> I've been seeing alot of youtube videos of layoffs in the tech field, and how hard it is for these people with years of experience to find a job.\n\nYour concern isn't about any specific field of but rather the exploitation of labor which capitalism demands.\n\nThe truth is that every single person with IT skills on the planet could be put to work today and there still would not be enough skilled workers to meet the actual demand for IT labor in the current market.\n\n> im about to hit my mid 30s and I don't want to invest all this time and money to later be unemployed and still in the kitchen\n\nThe difference between gaining IT skills and working physical labor is that if you treat your body well, in general if you don't develop some issue that hurts your mental faculties your mind will continue to function and even develop and thrive resulting in more skill thus more valued IT labor over time. This is not true for physical labor roles where your labor value tends to deteriorate over time.\n\n> I was watching an interview with one of the popular cybersec youtuber and even he was talking about how he personally know talented people who have been laid off and unemployed for months!\n\nThe problem with this is it is anecdotal. I'd question this data point along the lines of what niche roles these people hold, what actual employment opportunities they have attempted to seek and what market they are looking in. Cybersecurity is an incredibly vast field that is constantly developing and for which there are many, many open roles. I've personally seen very talented people be let go because they were unwilling to work within the business goals of a company.\n\nSomething you need to understand about publicly traded companies is that when \"the market\"/\"the street\" (Wall Street analysts) make a call about what they expect, and each company doesn't respond in kind, the value of the company stock is put at risk. For so many IT companies regarded as \"high growth\" the stock price directly reflects compensation rates for their highest paid employees due to the stock grants that are part of the employees' total compensation. So if Wall Street says they expect a company to justify their hiring over the last 8 quarters int he fact of the forecast of the next 4 quarters, depending on how aggressively they were hiring some companies may need to do a round of lay offs if they don't want their stock price to tank for the next 6-12 months. Here's the thing: just because the company is a \"tech company\" doesn't mean their layoffs are in their IT or engineering staff. For example, a tech company whose main revenue is around cyber security can't afford to let go of cyber security talent, because that's where their revenue comes from. However a company whose primary revenue comes from their CRM software business may be able to shed some of the roles within their security team without impacting their revenue.\n\nTalk to anyone who was mid-career during the 2008-2009 layoffs and ask them how long it took to start hiring back people they laid off. The similarities between the 2008-2009 and 2022-2023 labor downturns are uncanny for those of us who were there. The difference this time is that it was the tech sector rather than the financial sector who got hit the worst.\n\nThe point is that focussing on the current labor situation and social media personalities farming clicks isn't the best source for informing your own career. You should probably look in to the roles you are interested and get a better understanding of how they fit in to a business. This can help you understand which companies you should be seeking out, for example, highly regulated companies who sell services to the federal government or to medical or financial firms will have a huge requirement for meeting regulatory requirements mandated by law and when it comes to selling services to the federal government in particular these contracts tend to last a very long time, basically printing money *provided the firm can maintain their regulatory certification*. In these companies the cyber security domains of compliance and vulnerability management are critical for the business to maintain revenue. By contrast if you are a red-teamer/pen-tester at an e-commerce startup, if times get tough it's no skin off their back to let you go because they can always just rent the same skill set from a cyber security consulting firm (who will probably hire you for that contract after you're let go from the company).",
      "The amount of delusion people think of what it takes to get a cybersecurity job is truly amazing and I have to take my hat off to all these influencer ads that are being pushed to make it seem easy.\n\nNot only does it take grinding and learning multiple disciplines to become proficient in its also an extremely niche field so the amount of jobs will be even more competitive.\n\nMy advice would be to look into IT as a whole instead of a specific field. Work on your skillset and let your career take you where your true interest lie.",
      "Hey,\n\nUK Perspective here,\n\nSo I just landed a fully remote cyber sec analyst role, post about it is over here: (I detail my exp) [https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/15hjdb1/comment/juqluj3/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/15hjdb1/comment/juqluj3/)\n\nFor me to get noticed, I had to sacrifice a hell of a lot - I've loved every minute of the learning process and its fantastic that it's all finally paid off. The reason people want passion is because ultimately, this isn't a field where you can do 1 cert then walk through, especially for the more technical branched roles. You can go GRC/Auditing route which isn't technical, but... it's the least fun, but a foot in the door to then pivot.\n\nYou have to sacrifice a lot of evenings, time with friends, family to get to a level where you can sit at a desk and know exactly what you're looking at (or at least minimal training to get you up to speed). Theres a lot of competition right now from very talented indivuals who have worked in IT for a lot longer than I have who can't break in. I was carried completely by my passion for everything technological & my dedication to self-development - Which was all self funded & done during my lunchbreaks & evenings every day.\n\nIf you're only in it for the money, you won't go far in Cyber (if you get into at all) - Which there isn't anything wrong with, some people prefer to stay at the lower level jobs because less responsibility... Although in cyber you'll already have quite a high level of responsibility anyway.\n\nI'm all for people switching careers into IT, but if that spark ain't there; then guinely... I even wouldn't bother. For most people it's the helpdesk for a few years, which is already a painful process for a lot of people. Then over to network engineer/sysadmin role who then pivot with a small paycut over to Cyber because the higher level roles are more lucrative.\n\nBut hey if you're willing to spend time studying after work, grinding away & letting cyber be on the front of your mind most days whilst working the helpdesk, then Cyber is for you. As others have said, Cyber is just one small branch  of many on the tree that is Information Technology, don't fixate on this niche, who knows you might like Networking more.\n\nHope that helps!",
      "Geez, all these great advices and I've been wasting my time on YouTube! I'm going to be saving a lot of these comments  for me to read over again. Thank you to everyone!",
      "If there was a sure thing when it comes to a stable job we all would be going for it.  Its not the way to think about your future IMO because you are going to setup yourself for failure.  Find something you like and do it.  When you like something else go do it instead. Quit worrying about stuff you cant control",
      "The biggest challenge is to get past the catch-22.",
      "I'm still planning on getting into Security Engineering instead of Education (which I am currently in school for). Sadly it means a big pay cut because education pays a lot better than cybersec in my country, but it's more interesting.",
      "This showed on my suggested feed and since I'm in IT as well, here's my opinion.\n\nHaving cybersecurity as it's own field is disingenuous and damages the IT field and maybe even downgrades someone's real skill because they don't have some piece of paper that says they're good enough. They are one the same, where cybersecurity is an enhancement, or specialty that builds upon the foundation of IT.\n\nThink between nurses, doctors, and surgeons. They're all built upon the same field, same education, same degrees, but an enhancement of the previous.\n\nTidbit, we have a dedicated cybersecurity guy, cert and degrees, but he's worthless compared to our networking and systems guys that know the work, do the work, the full resposne stack. He's a glorified position that at best triages like a sudo manager.\n\nMy opinion, go for IT, but study and emphasize networking as the end goal. Get systems level experience in. Get it all. Then you'll be an effective cybersecurity.",
      "Hello all,\n\nSimilar question if someone is able to help :) \n\n  \nAs the title suggests I am keen on a career change into Cybersecurity and would like some advice on what roles I should begin applying for. \n\n  \nUp until recently I was working as Graduate Lawyer. I've had probably about 1.5yrs experience working in legal practice across a broad range of areas. Working in law I was faced with the realities of the profession and I realised I wasn't happy. In my experience, law is oversaturated with a poor ROI. No matter how hard one tries, personal and professional success isn't guaranteed. However, it's shown me how increasingly reliant we are on tech and sparked an interest/desire to up-skill in Cybersecurity. \n\n  \nIn saying that I hold the following:   \n1. Bachelor of Business (International Business) - also was awarded a Cert IV in International Trade and Dip in International Business during my first year  \n2. Bachelor of Laws  \n3. Graduate Diploma in Legal Practice; and   \n4. Security Clearance Neg Vetting 1\n\n  \nWork Experience was gained in diverse work environments and includes legal practice, the Army Reserves and luxury retail. \n\n  \nMy skillset is unique and easily transferable. Based on my experience I've got a strong customer service ethic, ability to learn fast, strong communication skills with an emphasis on translating tech info to non tech audiences, navigating high-pressure environments, managing competing deadlines and strong prioritisation skills - just to name a few. I am aware I lack the \"tech skills\", however,  I am enrolled in a Cert IV in Cybersecurity (100% Aus Government funded) to hone the technical and practical aspects.\n\n  \nMy question to the community is the following:  \n**1. What roles should I be applying for based on my experience?**   \n**2. If applying for an entry level position like a Service Desk Analyst, what steps should I be undertaking to go from that role to a role in Cybersecurity?**\n\n  \nAnyone who is in the same position, has done something similar, regardless of law or not, please share some advice as it would be appreciated! :)",

I've been trying to tell people.. there's people OLDER than you that freshly start in IT and quickly make 80-100k/yr.. personally I landed my first job making 55k in Sept and now at 72k/yr, in a lower COL area. In this climate there's so many mid-level positions open, our only set-back is how hungry you are\n\nAlthough I will say, even though certs aren't that important, I'm surprised you make that much with what you have.

    "content": "Hi guys! This is my dramatic job transition, tried to make it clean, it's a long read/rant, enjoy!  \nI've been a single sysadmin for 2 years in this company, did it all. When I came, there was nothing but switches and one router on a shelf (35 people), now there are almost 2 full racks, procedures, documentation, segmented departments etc (130 people). They are ISO 27001:2013 certified almost entirely my doing.   \nI've been asking for someone to help since the end of my year 1 there. They agreed to hire someone and put on a Senior sysadmin job ad. 9 months later, still my manager's 30th excuse was that the candidates aren't as qualified as me. Naturally, a few months after they posted the job, I asked why don't they just hire an IT support guy for the small problems and give me the Senior position since I was getting to the burnout state - no answer, even after I pushed for it, just promises.  \nFast forward, a lot of people started to leave at the beginning of the year since there were no bonuses for anyone except management and everyone can see that the company is doing exceptionally well finance wise. The last straw was at the end of this April, when they actually decided to give bonuses to every single employee (10-20% of the full 2018 year's salary + 20% raise). My bonus was a 15 USD raise in salary without any bonus. \n\nAfter such a slap in the face I obviously decided to leave and started my job search, found a great job in a small local data center with around 60 full racks that was expanding fast. Handed my resignation and one week later, I get notified by my manager that a new senior sysadmin is coming next week. In his words \"He's not as good as you, but you left us no choice\". I met the guy, he's actually coming to this position from a management position, suddenly realizing that he has to deal with \"my outlook doesn't work\" types of tickets on a weekly basis (hilarious). I told him what needs to be done by the end of the year. The usual: expand x and y subnets for department a and b, Win7 machines are a priority to upgrade or decommission, install new switch there and there (obviously has to be off hours, which I'm absolutely not doing any more (never got paid for it, just 1 to 1 days off after). I even showed him how to do everything CLICK BY CLICK. This is where I started to get that big fat grin on my face since he had never seen FortiOS, has no experience with clustering or DNS et cetera. Fast forward to my last day I'm sitting on a lobby waiting on the COO to hand me over something completely off-topic and just go home, when this guy comes with my manager.   \n*I'll pause for a moment to describe this guy, he has no backbone, it's not criticism, I've been in that state, but he's completely spineless. I saw this fast and felt a bit for his sorry a55 and stayed one night to do a few of the tasks that he needed to do, like replace and configure some network devices on one of the new floors. Re-showed him for the 4th time how to configure an IP phone et cetera.*  \nSo, here are they and my manager in a micro-panic asks me all the same questions for the 5th time (did you give him that and that and that, did you show him that and that and that). And here's when his voice suddenly emerged (no surprise he has the voice of a 5th grade girl), and started to complain rapidly. \"I wanted to subnet the networks but he didn't have time for me, I wanted him to show me how the redundant VPN works (which obviously I've shown him at least 2 times (it's automatic but sometimes some services do not work as well on the auxiliary ISP and have to be routed manually with a pre-made static routes by just right clicking ENABLE). Side note, I have a cold in that moment.\n\nAnd here is when my face just went 180 degrees (I'll admit, I almost snapped), \"you little sissy, I haven't even left and you're already using me as an excuse ?!\" Got up, bursted into the COO's office, got my stuf and left. \n\nI'm extremely happy at my new job, wouldn't usually take the time to write this (as you can obviously see by my karma), but yesterday I got the last paycheck from that same cheap-a55 IL company - and it was 1/3rd of the money they owed me. I called my boss, who immediately said that this is what he got from accounting. Called accounting - \"this is all we owe you mister\". Called a friend that's a lawyer, he asked me the usual things (how much per months, days off per year etc), who told me to callback accounting and tell them to check a few specific paragraphs from ... the law book (lol... yea, I'm bad at legal stuff). After which they called me back apologizing and assuring me I'll get all my money by the end of the day (yesterday). Here we are, I still haven't gotten 2/3rds of it. Really wanna leave this behind me already and relax.  \n\n\nDon't stay in a place that does not value you, value yourself first!  \nThanks for reading!",

Most 130 person orgs have a cheap admin, maybe two virtualization hosts, a few switches and a firewall. Many do a lot of their work in SaaS, so their on premise footprint is pretty small.

They get you the interview, and nothing beyond that. Experience is what truly matters. If you don't have relevant (or enough) experience, you won't get past the interviews. The entry field is the worst it's ever been. I can't emphasize that enough. I'm 30. I did a year at TCAT Memphis, got my A+, Net+, and Sec+ and I'm struggling to find a job. I applied for about 25 jobs. I got an interview in 4 of them. I got one of them. It's a at a construction site. We're building the literal building. Sure, it's IT related. But only in the sense I have to go to the roof to install 20 WAPs, or run the cables through the warehouse etc They were desperate, which is why I got it.\n\nMy honest advice would be if you're in it for the money, don't bother. My experience isn't unique. Look at this sub. You'll see PLENTY of people with the same experience. If you want high figures, go into another field. If you truly like the field and enjoy it, then stay, but know that you're going to struggle to find employment for quite a few years.\n\nedit: something I wanted to add, to be clear, this field is GROSSLY nepotistic. I read so many posts with people saying networking (i.e. someone you know) is the best way to land a job. It's like that in most fields, but the amount of nepotism that seems to run rampant in the IT is fucking incredible.",

Youll probably have to start at a helpdesk level. But theres pros and cons to that as well. Like getting some good ground up experience in how the whole machine works. Unfortunately the pay is not the greatest but its kind of just the way the industry works (in most cases). \n\nCertifications wont put you in a mid or upper level position so dont let anybody fool you with spending a lot of money on school. Certifications are good, but getting an IT degree is probably not a great idea at this point for you until youre already in some type of IT position. The best thing you can do is prove yourself in a lower position and then move up. Once you start moving up, things be will get better pretty quickly. Things move fast in IT.

I would support all 5 terminals they had and their trucking software along with training people in classes on MS Office when I had people in need. I would travel to LA, ND, CO & UT to train truckers and office personnel on the trucking software, also I trained IT people to take over the software.

      "I got my first IT job when I was 32.\n\nOf course I started when I was 29.\n\nMy advice for you is to keep it at an associates level at first, as actual work experience is a lot more valuable than anything higher than an AS (at first.)\n\nAlmost any entry level job will probably not require a college degree. Having one is good because it shows that you can learn new things. But from an entry level standpoint, an AS proves that as much as a BS, But one is twice as expensive. \n\nIf you master the art of online, nights and weekends School. You can always go back after a few months in your first job to finish your BS. \n\nIf you want a job while you're going back to school, try substitute teaching if you already have a 4-year degree.

    "title": "Got my first cybersecurity interview only 2.5 months into my career change",
    "content": "Background info on me: i am 23 years old, i went to college for a few semesters before dropping out, and worked in healthcare for 3.5 years, from 2020-2024 (i was a pharmacy technician, and then became a pediatric medical assistant). During this time i also was into web design, and i started freelancing on the side in my free time and making websites for friends, myself, and small businesses here and there (2021-2023). In December of 2023 i started an LLC for web design, and i had 2 overseas employees working for me on a contract basis, and i would serve as project manager. I expanded our services to include web hosting as well, and now we manage web hosting services for a handful of our clients.\n\nOk boom. In july of 2024, i saw a youtube video that was titled start your cybersecurity career in 7 days. While it did pique my initial interest snd curiosity, i was obviously skeptical because i had been hearing about how cybersecurity isnt entry level. That youtube video changed my life. After watchin that YouTube video, i go t the following certifications in a few days: qualys vulnerability management, detection, and response (VMDR), Qualys cybersecurity asset management (CSAM), and qualys vulnerability management scanning (VMS). From there i started getting into cybersecurity youtube, and started finding more free courses. I started the google cybersecurity professional certifcate program, and i loved it. It gave me hands on experience with linux, sql, and python, (3 things i had NEVER used or even seen before). I became obsessed. I started doing TONS of projects, labs, and activities that would help strengthen my skills and resume. Besides those 3 languages, the google course also gave me experience with tcpdump, wireshark, and google chronicle. While i was taking the google course i was also doing some free cybersecurity virtual experience programs on the forage. I completed the mastercard cybersecurity program, the datacom cybersecurity program, the PwC switzerland cybersecurity program, the commonwealth bank intro to cybersecurity program, and most recently the Telstra cybersecurity SOC program. From these i gained hands on skills in other things, like  splunk, cybersecurity engineering, SOC incident response, and more. While i was doing all of this, i was slowly creating and building up both my resume and portfolio, and adding cybersecurity recruiters on linkedin.\n\nAfter completing the google course (which took me exactly two months coincidentally; july 24- september 24th) i started applying to jobs. I was spamminggggg applications and sending messages to recruiters. I just started applying to jobs last friday (september 21st) and sent out probably 200 applications in total. Yesterday, i got my first invitation to an interview, and it was for a cybersecurity analyst position at a bank. I almost shed tears of happiness because of how happy i was that all of my hard work is paying off. Obviously i understand its only an interview, and i dont have the job yet, but still it was so rewarding to see that email, and feel as though my endless hard work for the past few months has been paying off. I am still going to apply for more jobs, and continue to further my education and skills.\n\nI am going to get my compTIA Security+ soon (now that i have the 30% discount voucher i received from the google cybersecurity course) and i also scheduled the free ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity exam for november 6th. I cant wait to keep adding onto my list of skills and certifications. Ive been obsessed with cybersecurity lately, and i hope to make this my new career. \n\nEdit: also, a few ppl have asked about my portfolio, so im going to link it here: [my cybersecurity journey](https://justingoncalves34.github.io/Cybersecurity_Journey/)\n\nEdit 2: didnt get the job ill keep studying though, completing courses, and adding projects and experience along my journey. Hopefully i get something soon!",

Theres no need to hurry; were not just looking for quick results, but for knowledgeable and skilled cyber experts.\n\nHands-on experience will definitely help, but if you dont land the job right away, set realistic expectations. You can always gain valuable experience through helpdesk roles or other IT work.\n\nIve learned that getting past HR is one thing, but during the interview, you really need to know your stuff.

Had a great recruiter who was able to get someone to fill my 2nd role for myself to move to a 3rd contract to hire role for $35 which I stayed for 6 months and moved on All positions were large corporate companies. The staffing companys relationships trumped my lack of experience, and almost no worries on \"interviews\" since they would pretty much take you on if you fit and were willing to keep learning. Depending on where you live, and what salary your targeting  you should be able to move up fairly quickly from let's say 50k-75k within 1 year. After 70k and up you will need more experience.

Here are some key points you might consider including:  \n\n\n1. \\*\\*Problem-Solving Skills\\*\\*: Emphasize your experience in problem-solving and critical thinking, as these are crucial skills in both law enforcement and cybersecurity.\n2. \\*\\*Attention to Detail\\*\\*: Highlight your attention to detail, an essential skill for both investigating crimes and identifying security breaches or vulnerabilities in systems.\n3. \\*\\*Experience with Law and Regulations\\*\\*: Mention any specific experience you have with law, regulations, and compliance, as understanding legal aspects is often important in cybersecurity roles.\n4. \\*\\*Handling Sensitive Information\\*\\*: Your experience in handling confidential or sensitive information in law enforcement can be a significant asset in cybersecurity, where protecting sensitive data is key.\n5. \\*\\*Communication Skills\\*\\*: Law enforcement roles often require strong communication skills, which are equally important in cybersecurity for explaining technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.\n6. \\*\\*Technology Skills\\*\\*: If you have any specific technical skills or have used technology extensively in your policing role, be sure to list these. Any familiarity with cybersecurity tools or concepts is a plus.\n7. \\*\\*Stress Management\\*\\*: Your ability to remain calm and effective under pressure is a valuable skill, especially in incident response roles within cybersecurity.\n8. \\*\\*Teamwork and Leadership\\*\\*: Experience in working as part of a team and any leadership roles you've held are important to mention.\n9. \\*\\*Continuous Learning\\*\\*: Cybersecurity is a field that requires ongoing learning due to its rapidly evolving nature. Highlight your commitment to continuous learning and professional development, perhaps through courses or certifications youve pursued.\n10. \\*\\*Certifications or Relevant Training\\*\\*: If you have taken any courses or certifications related to cybersecurity, like CompTIA Security+, Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), or others, make sure to list them.\n11. \\*\\*Transferable Skills\\*\\*: Identify and articulate transferable skills from your law enforcement career that would be beneficial in cybersecurity, such as investigative techniques, risk assessment, and emergency response management.\n12. \\*\\*Real-World Scenarios\\*\\*: If possible, provide examples where you applied your skills in real-world scenarios that could be analogous to cybersecurity situations, such as dealing with cybercrimes or digital evidence in your policing role.Remember to tailor your resume to each specific job you're applying for, highlighting the most relevant experiences and skills for each position. Networking within the cybersecurity community can also be beneficial, as it can provide insight into the industry and potentially lead to job opportunities.",
      "Ill offer a different route to cybersecurity. I hear people talk about the help desk route as the way into to cyber. I happen to think that that route  will be the slowest and will pay the least until you actually get to a decent role. I also may add that it will probably be the most stressful. \n  Ill offer an alternative. Learn some coding. In particular python, JavaScript or maybe even java. Get familiar with apis and how the cloud works. Try to find an entry level job in that OR take some very cheap freelance jobs on upwork. I mean something like $20 for very quick tasks. Do a couple of those, to build your reputation and experience. Then start transitioning to cyber with a few entry level certs like network+ and security+. At that point apply for roles in application security (Appsec). \n In total this route might take about 2-3 years but you will get to a higher paying job faster with less stress. Just my 2 cents, which doesnt mean anything. \n And yes this is very similar to the route I took.",

Being able to put this on my resume opened so many new IT doors. While working 2 jobs wasnt ideal, I sacrificed 4 months of social life for a lifetime of salary increases. It was stressful and exhausting but paid off in spades when my first IT gig was a 60% pay increase from the job I was stuck in.  \n\n(Funny how the grass is seems greenerI personally would love to be a cop if I could do my youth all over again haha)",

      "I knew a guy who did exactly what you are looking at.   \nEntirely possible. He had to move to a new area though because we live in a cornfield.  \n\n\nHis roadmap was simple. He got an associates in IT at our local community college (I dont remember the specific one but know that the networking degree at the school included security class). Then went on to a 4 year degree program at Western Governors in cyber security. He worked as a LEO for maybe 15 years+/-. He knocked out certs as he went in school.  \n\n\nPart of what is holding you back in getting your foot at the door is that companies have a hard time trusting a person with no official IT experience. As odd as it may sound given your work and mgmnt exprience, an internship may be a great place to start. I realize it is not ideal but its a trust gap that you have to overcome.   \n\n\nMy first break into IT came exactly as an internship and morphed into a full time position. I was essentially a network technician and occasional help desk (small company so many roles). Eventually they were able to recognize other skills I already had vs what I was working toward and offered a lateral transition that was mutually beneficial. I now work in marketing, similar pay scale and the simple truth I am more impactful so I feel a bit more accomplished when I head home for the day.  \n\n\nEventually I would like to get into net admin but also recognize that living in a corn field has limitations unless im willing to move.

My advice ,as someone who made the jump in 2020 from doing landscaping to now working a desktop position, just study get those certs and keep gaining experience. I know how youre feeling but IT is a good field to get into without a degree. Although you will be picked over by people with degrees and military exp quite often and thats fine the future is computers keep applying.",

      "Short answer is yes. You don't need a degree. You just need to show that you will do what it takes to learn. You will have to start at the bottom. Look and see if there are any local small MSP's looking to hire. Start there and gain experience. Take certs only if its required. Certs can help as they are HR filters. Degree's in IT is a little strange. I started with no degree and no certs and had a ton over experience and went back after 20+ years and did an AAS degree because it was free in my state. I am now at over 35 years in my career and decided to go back and get a BSCIA. I do have A+, Net+ and Sec+ among others as they are required for the degree and was easier for me to just knock them out before I start. I guess what I am saying is you can always go back and get a degree if you want. The degree may help if you want to move up higher in management for a large company.

I dont like Cyber that much, and also have a criminal record, so it will probably be difficult to land something in that field. \n\nBut Im doing it because I want to. And because I know I can. And also just so people who know my background can watch what Ive done and be inspired. \n\nLife is all you vs you kind sir. \n\nExternal opinions mean nothing in the grand scheme of YOUR vision. \n\nIm sure you will succeed. \n\nExcelsior!",
      "Started at 29 .currently 31 worked up the helpdesk ladder and got promoted to JR Devops. \n\nNever too late if you apply yourself.",
      "29 here and about to graduate. Id say that i have yet to hit my PRIME.",
      "No, it's not too late. I did a wide variety of jobs through my 20s; I lost a year taking care of a terminally ill family member during the pandemic and had to get back into the job market at the bottom rung of the ladder. From there I was able to pivot into IT at 29 and became the systems administrator/technology director of my site. I've had that role for a couple years now.\n\nThere was some luck involved, of course, as there always is. But if you can demonstrate enthusiasm and aptitude then it's definitely possible.",
      "Of course it's not to late but CS is a field that's growing quickly.  In my office alone, I believe there are 4 or 5 techs, out of about 8 of us, studying for Cyber Security degrees.",
      "I left teaching at 27. I had a degree in elementary education and nothing else. No certifications. No professional IT experience.\n\nI applied for a help desk job near my hometown. They ended up calling me in for an interview because of stage management experience I had in the local EDM scene which involved A/V knowledge. I ended up getting the job and moved up to Network & System Administrator within 3 or 4 years.\n\nI would include any relevant information you can on your resume. Spice it up the language with ChatGPT. Focus on any relevant experience & self taught skills you have gained in technology. Use that information in your interview. Focus on process and willingness/eagerness to learn."

I'm taking over for someone who is set to retire soon and despite having imposter syndrome before getting into the job I have been quite successful at it for about 3 weeks now. \n\nI feared that maybe I actually didn't know what I was doing and that I couldn't possibly do the job but these 3 weeks have made me feel way better in that sense. I'm learning a lot everyday but I don't feel completely hopeless doing all that I do. My job has been so incredible and I just want to say to those concerned or worried about taking the switch, that there is a place out there willing to take you on without pieces of papers. As long as you can prove your ability and not be afraid to admit when you're wrong then someone will come along and take you on! \n\nIn the process of obtaining pieces of papers but I absolutely love my job and if I can survive here financially and be able to do what I want to do, then I may just retire out at this company.

      "Obv if this is something you want to do go for it but I just feel the need to say dont lol. I graduated with a degree in digital forensics but decided to switch to IT because I enjoyed the problem solving aspect of it. I work for large companies who outsource their IT such as government, emergency services, large law firms, medical practices, ect. The career was fun at first but now that hacking is so prevalent and firms love cutting costs you will have to deal with extremely stressful days/nights. I still wake up panicking thinking someone is getting hacked after a client got ransomware because the owner wanted all his partners to have full admin rights and refused to listen to our pleas and warnings. One got tricked by an email and it destroyed their network and we were up through the night for a week recovering from all the damage. The amount of places who refuse to be HIPAA compliant or use small free things like MFA because its annoying is horrifying. \n\nMost my friends in this industry have been switching out, Im only here bc I spent years building experience building networks and dont want to start over at a lower salary in another field. Things might be easier if you work at a large firm that takes IT/Security serious but in my experience no one takes IT security serious except for the IT department which leads to when not if a company experiences an incident. If you get into it I hope you have a great experience but I just wanted to warn you, if I could go back in time and stick with forensics I would be much happier."

We had to call a technician from our national natural gas supplier to check for gas leaks and disconnect the water heater from the main gas line. I thought, How nice is this? He gets to be on the road, helping people out, making visits, and ensuring their homes dont explode. I was talking to him, and it turns out you basically just need to be a plumber to do this kind of work. It made me think. Beats pushing pixels around a screen dealing with asshole managers rushing and stressing you all week long for something so useless to human life. \n\nRegarding nurses, my two sisters are both nurses, and they are both burnt out. Theyre stuck in that wing for 12 hours on end. But to understand how you felt, when my partner gave birth, I watched the staff work, and it seemed like exciting work to be in a hospital. I get the same feeling when I go to the airportpeople and action everywhere. But I think there must be other factors to consider as well.\n\n\nIf you have the money do it.

Hospitals are so understaffed that no more than one person can leave the unit for a meal break at any one time, so you eat alone. Everyone is overworked, so even if you need help with a patient, it is like pulling teeth to get another nurse to help you because he/she has a full load of critical patients, too. The hours are brutal (3pm-3am or 7pm to 7am for new grads) and do not allow for a life outside of work. Its exhausting. And thats not factoring in the stress of actually caring for patients in their worst moments. Dont just think the grass is greener.",

Highly recommend the ER if you're looking for keeping things interesting and actually making a difference. \n\nSometimes it's just handing out turkey sandwiches to a homeless guy who's drunk, sometimes it's literally saving someone's life. \n\nI enjoyed the freedom of scheduling that comes with it and the fact that I'll never be without a job or have to worry about a recession or anything like that. I have to turn down offers for jobs every single day. \n\nAll the stuff like blood and bodily fluids and smells and all that you just get straight up used to it and desensitized, it doesn't even matter anymore. I've literally had my hand inside of a man's necrotic ulcer scooping poop out with gloved hands and felt his tailbone, Life goes on.

If you want to do nursing, I would suggest something like OR or NICU. Wound care nurses also seem to like their roles but, obviously, wounds can be pretty gnarly. Go into r/nurses and search the sub for phrases like who actually likes their job and the like. I am not a nurse (Im not anything, yet), but I looked into it for a while. I have an older criminal background, so I left that dream behind. \n\nIf you reconsider a career switch, maybe you can explore finding a happy medium and look for tech roles in hospitals?  Maybe a nonprofit (although, that has its own challenges)?  Or, look for some government positions? \n\nYou could get your CNA license and pick up a year worth of shifts (I know you wouldnt be able to work a full schedule, with your other job) to see if you even like nursing, at all. If you like being a CNA, I think youd like being an RN. You just need the appropriate amount of time to realize it. If you hate it, then you didnt leave your other job, nor make a full-blown career switch. If it does work out, you have a year of CNA experience under your belt, which will help when you look for work as an RN. Another benefit of getting your CNA and working, first, could be tuition reimbursement. The hospital may pay for you to go back to school, in full. Im not sure if you have to meet a certain amount of hours (i.e., a full-time work schedule) or if you have to work there for a certain amount of time to qualify for tuition reimbursement, but thatd be the way Id go. Yes, being a CNA sounds like a bit of a nightmare Im not gonna lie. But, if you can handle that, youll have a good idea of whether or not you can handle nursing. \n\nIm sure they will appreciate more male nurses!",

Every single one of them is burnt out. 3 of them switched to the office side of nursing, the other two are in the process of trying to get out altogether. \n\nA couple of years ago my brother needed brain surgery. There was a complication during the first surgery so he had to have two surgeries in the span of a month. My sister, mom, and I all took shifts to be with him around the clock. I lived at that hospital for like two solid months. Watching what those nurses had to put up with made me change my major (I was going for nursing at the time). \n\nVolunteer at a hospital and watch the nurses as much as you can. Then you can make an informed decision. I would also look at things like burn out rates, salary trajectory, pros/cons lists, hospital bureaucracy stats that kind of stuff to inform yourself on whether this is really a switch you want to make. Good luck out there; I sincerely hope you find what youre looking for.",

If your office job isnt making you happy then it makes no sense to go back to school to get a different office job. \n\nIm not sure where you live (make sure the pay is okay) but becoming an EMT/paramedic is also a good option! Its a bit less schooling than nursing in most countries. I think people who get into healthcare later in life generally do really well in the profession. Im a paramedic, been doing it 5 years and I absolutely love it! \n\nNursing is great too because there are so many options! If you worry about burn out there are definitely postions this happens less in! Scrub nurse, any nurse that assists in procedures, public health, outpatient clinics, etc. There are endless opportunities.",

Was also sys admin. \n\nThing is, the struggle people have is fucking real and giving up what you have now is something you might end up painfully regretting later on. \n\nMy advice: try new things but keep your current job or try to deviate but nothing extreme like full time nurse.

Pay is good (and even better if youre willing to work more), mobility is great, schedule is fantastic, lots of interactions with people (both good and bad). If youre interested in nursing, see if you can shadow one. \n\nAdditionally, if you hate working bedside, you can always go back into the office. I know plenty of people who have switched to managerial roles, education roles, and even IT roles in healthcare if you want that again. \n\nThere are definitely downsides to the job like Admin, disrespect from patients, early mornings if you work dayshift/pulling all nighters if you work nights.

Pursue things outside of work that you enjoy or always wanted to pursue. I rely heavily on a range of hobbies for fulfillment because I relied on my job for fulfillment and never found it.\n\nIn your case you hate the isolation of your career and if that is negatively affecting you then changing to something with more social interaction would be beneficial but please don't convince yourself that it will be any less boring once it becomes your normal.\n\nGood luck!",

He found the change fulfilling and now enjoys a carefree, happy, single life in his 40s, investing in cryptocurrency with the financial freedom to do so.\n\nIf youre not planning on having kids or dont have significant financial commitments like debt or a mortgage, you could consider a similar path. It really comes down to what you valuedo you live to work, or work to live? I chose to work in the disability sector because its something Im passionate about, and despite the challenges, I find it deeply fulfilling.\n\nWe spend about one-third of our lives working and another third sleeping.

I bailed on that and went back to school, got a PhD, and am now a Professor. My job is just as easy as my corporate gigs, but 1000000x more fulfilling.

      "Hey, \n\nI was like you once. 10 years ago, I was 25, and a sysad. I fucking hated it. I quit and became a brewer at a local brewery. I loved it...for about 2 weeks. \n\nWhat I realized is that it wasn't the work that bothered me. It was the environment I was in. \n\nI don't know exactly what's going on in your noggin. That's up to you, but what I found is that 90% of my experience at work is based on the environment I am in. The people around me. Not the actual work.\n\nI quit that brewery job, and it ultimately killed my hobby of home brewing too. I went back to IT and found a pretty great company to work for. Now, I run the IT department. \n\nAs far as purpose. You got to find your own meaning in the situation you're in. Finding another job might do that, or you might end up in the same mindset in just a different role.\n\nPersonally, I find purpose in my job even now because I know what I do has a direct impact on how people are getting paid at my job. If a certain app isn't running, people aren't getting paid, and with most people in the world living paycheck to paycheck, I feel obligated to make sure these folks are getting the money they deserve to support their families. \n\nBut I understand your sentiment. Before this, I was in the military. I swept for IEDs in Iraq and Afghanistan (Route Clearance). Your purpose is a lot more cut and dry in those types of situations, and it's the same for nursing.

      "As someone who made a career change at 31 with a MBA, heres my advice. Take it with however many grains of salt you need.\n\nA MBA is not a magic bullet to a new industry. It can happen, but its not that easy. Most people move into adjacent industries or consulting.\n\nIts really only useful to get your foot in the door at another company or to check a box with your current company. That being said, you seem like youre definitely on your way out at your current company so definitely do not get one for them.\n\nIf you decide to go back to school. Make sure you have a plan on what you want to do, ie: consulting, finance, etc pick a lane and stay in it.\n\nThe most important parts of a MBA are the name of the school and the networking it affords. It does not have to be a top 5 school if the name is important in your area. For example: A Georgia Tech degree in Atlanta is as good or better than an Ivy League degree because most of the major players in Atlanta have GT degrees and the school works hard to get those companies into their networking. Networking becomes your full time job. You need to talk to as many people as you can to help get a feel for what you want to do and how to get there. These people will also help you get your foot in the door.\n\nDont go into a MBA hoping it will solve your problems. The people in my cohort who had no plan stayed with the current companies and really havent thrived. The people who went in with a plan got hired in big consulting firms, major industry players and FAANGs.",

Just think back to your own experience getting a bachelors. Did all these amazing options open up because of a college degree? \n\nIronically the intention to get more people educated created an unintended consequence. What happens when a lot of people get degrees, including graduate ones like MBA etc ? \n\nThe degrees become commodified and dont make you stand out. Universities are just for profit entities that are like diploma mills. They dont care what happens to the students - they just want to churn out as many graduates and students as possible. \n\nAnd if you dont believe me, ironically you should do some market research on MBA graduates. \n\nThis is one of the #1 key issues I have with telling people to get a bachelors or MBA. They just blindly go into it because they were told it would lead to these jobs. \n\nBut they dont do their own research and then find out afterwards it doesnt get them what they want at all. \n\nFind and conduct some informational interviews from people who have graduated with MBAs and see if they got that lucrative job because of the MBA or because of other reasons like prior experience in other fields.\n\n\nNow, to answer your question, I would say sales is the most realistic option because it doesnt require a degree and you can get started the fastest. \n\nB2b sales would probably be the best for money but b2C can also be lucrative. Look into those industries and learn more about sales. \n\nStarting a business with no idea is a a terrible plan. You dont start a business to make money.

Where do I want to be in 5 years? And is an MBA the most efficient path to get there.  \n\nThats a tough question to answer all at once. I approached it by writing down a list of the aspects and skills of my current role that I liked and disliked. Do you like selling you, your companies products, or your work to other people? Then Sales or Consulting could make sense. Important to remember Consulting and Banking at their core are sophisticated sales jobs. The path to selling is much shorter post MBA. If you enjoy being buried in a model, the technical side of things, then maybe a data role is more up your alley. Im not an expert in that world though. To me seems like an area that could get gobbled up by AI relatively quickly.  \n\nThe people who get in trouble in my program (I.e. graduated without jobs or were unable to switch industries) were people who didnt plan effectively coming in. They expected to head to school and figure it out when they got there. That put them behind the curve. You have to come to campus with some idea of what you want and how an MBA can get you there.  \n\nThere are 2 lessor known bits of info on MBAs that can change the calculus on being worth it. First is the power of regional schools. I wanted to end up in Chicago. I did my MBA at a state school in the Midwest that was ranked in the top 30 or so. I had a ton of great job offers in Chicago. Im not sure going to Duke would have really moved the needle much unless I needed to be at MBB. Second piece of info is many schools give scholarships.

Make sure you really want and need the degree. If you are genuinely interested in accounting, as an adult with work experience and an undergraduate degree, you could get into an accounting position.

Something like 3/4 of wealth is inherited, not earned, and what fraction of the wealth that's \"made\" (not-inherited) do you believe is just monopoly extracted (not actually created)?\n\nMBA is for people already employed. Basically, never pay for MBA. It's for your company to pay for you to do, then you come back and make $100k/yr more, and get a little more fast-tracked on that \"solid career progression\" you crave.\n\nYou can do data science without a degree. Degrees aren't tickets to progression/earnings anymore.\n\nSales in tech has high pay / progression. Not sure how to start, though.\n\nIn business: I've found whenever I'm doing it to \"make money\" I fail.

      "27F here, so I wouldnt call it mid life but Ive had some pretty drastic career changes in my life especially from what I expected to be doing by now. \n\nI thought I wanted to train horses for the majority of my childhood, I started riding horses at 6, competing at 8, and did mostly jobs related to that from 14-22 years old, and worked a retail job alongside that while going to college to pursue equine business management. I realized at 21 that it was one of the most dangerous self employment careers I could have chosen and not very profitable so I dropped out of school to take some time to figure out whether college was something I would need for whatever I ended up doing and went into manufacturing shortly after. So much different, as one would imagine. I went from mucking stalls, feeding dozens of horses, riding/helping train several a day, handling mares and foals, and doing various medical care. I learned to sew, use various industrial equipment, a forklift license, and got 2 certifications in industrial plastics processing and injection molding technology. It was about as hard on the body as working with animals, but not quite as unpredictable. The plastics stuff was really cool to learn and work with and really exercised a part of my brain I didnt know I was good with. I did that for 4 years and was eventually promoted into shift and department management, until there were upper management issues that drove me away from working for that company any longer. I tried other plastics manufacturers but despite the poor management of my first employer in the field, I discovered their working conditions were far above standard and left the industry. I was also DJing bars and clubs on the side while working that job prior to COVID, which was kind of my fun on the side. I now DJ weddings as well as help with the office/equipment management aspects of the company I work with for booking events, which are obviously both different from my previous jobs again but I do get to do equipment repairs, which exercises some of the the mechanical and tech skills I learned working in manufacturing. The organization and time management aspects of working weddings also pull on skills I gained while managing people. I recently also picked up a job at a medical/recreational weed dispensary, which is weirdly similar to my previous manufacturing job, actually. Proper packaging weights, first in first out, kanban inventory systems, and lean inventory management. Just add in the customer service aspect, which Id already done in retail. \n\nIts been a lot of twists and turns, but Im very grateful for all the experiences Ive had and happy with where Ive ended up. My customers at the dispensary are amazing and every weekend I get to make the soundtrack to the most important day of a couples lives. I still get to interact with horses through a friend who breeds reining show horses for a living, still get to utilize the assembly and sewing skills I learned in manufacturing in my own projects and that job also taught me a lot about problem solving and mechanical inclination. I plan to get a 3D printer when I can spare the cost so I can keep using my plastics knowledge for personal projects. \n\nAll in all, while changing careers can be scary, theres inevitably going to be things from any job that are high value going into the next one, even in a totally different field. There are going to be skills that stick with you no matter what and will continue to come in handy. Ive done so many various types of work that I pick up on things quickly and people are often surprised by it when I go into a new opportunity because my resume isnt a consistent string of similar jobs. I feel like too many people feel stuck doing what theyve always done or what they dreamed of doing as a kid, and dont realize their skills are far more flexible than they think!",

      "I've done so many things that I've never really had a career change.  I've done phone tech support, I've been a system builder, network admin, shipping and distribution manager, warehouse manager, call center manager, department head, marketing manager, accountant, graphic designer, warehouse worker, concierge, and I even did the Amazon thing for a couple weeks.  I was a farmer when I was young, then a cook for a few years, then a graphic designer for a few more.  Many of the positions I listed had a lot of overlap.  I was a department head but also had to deal with inbound tech calls and credit card processing implementation.\n\nSo I decided at 42 years old, \"I need to do something that looks like a career.\"  I went out and got an insurance producer license for life, health, and casualty.  Tried selling health insurance for a while and hated it.  I realized that the only thing I've ever really enjoyed doing was customer service and support.  I like helping people.\n\nNow I work in customer support for group life insurance coverage.  Honestly, I love it.  Interesting problems, interesting people, the pay is adequate, plenty of room for promotion, good benefits, and a sense of stability.  Sure, it's a huge corporation which I've never done (except for contract work at Thomson-Reuters) but I'm tired of working for companies in the small to medium business world.  Too much stress.  Everything is always personal when you have to talk to the CEO every day.\n\nIt's corporate for me now and it's great.

      "I'm really enjoying reading through everyone's comments here...humanity truly has a lot of expressions.\n\nI'm in my mid-30s and worked various non-profit jobs right out of college from preschool/education, to refugee/immigrant support, administration, and community gardening. I got totally burnt out and needed to address my own trauma and disconnection from the Earth. Grateful that my family supported me financially and I had the opportunity to learn how to farm on a rental property I managed during the pandemic, creating natural body care products, and engaging in a profound journey of deep healing and reconnecting with my roots.\n\nI realized I had been severely undervaluing myself due to internalized shame from family, culture, society, etc (I'm an Asian American woman). Started setting clear boundaries, taking better care of myself, and following my intuition which I had been thoroughly dissociating from. I quit my non-profit jobs and started off small by working at a local organic grocery store to assist with cooking classes, then working part-time at a crisis line, and studying massage therapy/somatic coaching and taking on a part-time job as a massage therapist. For the past five years, I have also been running a small business selling plants and natural body care products at neighborhood markets which was a great way to practice my people skills. These were fun and educational transitional careers during my healing process and I plan on ending them this year. I have always been more of a right-brain than left-brain person, and I find farming to be an endlessly creative (literally) process especially now that I am cultivating medicinal herbs but will be doing this for myself instead. My witchy desires have come to fruition...learning to sing and drum with the birds and be present with the vibrant green of plants has been infinitely healing to my soul.\n\nMore recently I went on a plant medicine retreat and have been moving through a spiritual awakening. Letting go of attachments to money, fame, materialism, and external validation has been quite freeing. I was just accepted into an MSW (Master's in Social Work) program with a sizeable scholarship which would require me to work in community mental health for three years post-graduation while I gain hours towards my licensure as an LICSW. It seems the job security is great, as we are going through a collective awakening and are in need of guidance and support. I am interested in the intersection between indigenous communities, Earth-based healing, organic spirituality, food systems, shamanism, energy healing, etc. My spirit has been leading me down this path for a long time, and I'm finally becoming conscious of this...recognizing the importance of savoring the journey, each day is a treasure.\n\nI wish for peace and serenity for all, and that we can embrace this collective transformation with more ease :)",

      "Most people change careers and 28 is so young. \n\nI know you probably feel like youre getting up there since youre close to 30, but you have more working years in front of you than behind you.",
      "Im going to comment something Ive learned from a comedian about romance but it also applies to careers. Time does not equal success. You can spend 10 or more years in a career and only then, after everything, realize that you are not working towards the image you once thought you were and realize that you want different things. And you have 2 very difficult questions to ask yourself:\n\n1. Do I admit the last 10 years of my life have been a waste?\n2. Do I waste the rest of my life? \n\nOur generation has become so obsessed with starting the rest of their lives that they are willing to give up the one they are currently living. If you are not comfortable asking yourself these questions, its because you are terrified of the answers. I mean this in the most genuine way possible, the worst thing you can do with your life is spend it with the wrong human being, or in this case, the wrong career. \n\nAnd lastly, one of my favorite quotes from F. Scott Fitzgerald, For what its worth... its never too late  to be whoever you want to be. Theres no time limit. Start whenever you want. You can change or stay the same. There are no rules to this thing. We can make the best or the worst of it. I hope you make the best of it. I hope you see things that startle you. I hope you feel things youve never felt before. I hope you meet people who have a different point of view. I hope you live a life youre proud of, and if youre not, I hope you have the courage to start over again.",

      "At 28, you probably have 40 years of work ahead of you. I made career change at 48 and took a great part time job in my late 50s for a few years after I retired. Best choices in my life.\n\nI was mostly happy in software development for over 30 years, then switched to teaching dog trainers to train dogs at 48, then to professional photography and drone flying in my late 60s. I took massive pay cuts, but was happy. \n\nMy ex wife switched jobs to teaching at 35. My now wife also  switched to teaching in her 40s. Both took large pay cuts. \n\nSince I was generally happy in my software career, I got past boredom by switching jobs to different types of systems, and because software development is ever changing, there was always mental stimulation.\n\nThere is no harm in switching careers, or even just jobs, to keep yourself happy.

I would say there can be different approaches taken here. You either start with small steps , doing something on the side while still working and making your regular salary or you go all in. You have to calculate basically how much you really need to survive and then go from there. But this will only work if you're pursuing something you're super passionate about.",

It worked for me because I went from absolutely hating my career in my 20s to loving my career after getting this degree!

      "I'm 25 as well, but no degree, no money, no car, and no job outlook. No savings, barely any food, and no way to pursue education. I'm making ~$20k a year as a janitor, and let me tell you my job is really boring and I get zero satisfaction out of it. You're extremely lucky in the sense that you have financial security and a career at this age, I would kill (not literally) to have that, or even the faintest hope of ever having that. I also have extreme mental health problems that make day to day living almost unbearable.\n\nThis isn't to make you feel bad. Don't sit there and feel guilty because of what I said. Conversely please don't shame me for my position, you don't know the circumstances that lead me here.\n\nI say this because, something I have learned way down here at the bottom barrel of society as a janitor on the brink of homelessness, is that it helps to be grateful for what you do have. You have a spouse, you have money, you have atleast somewhat good mental health I would imagine to be where you are. You have savings. You actually have a future. (Im doubtful i can say the same)\n\nI'm at the opposite end of the economic spectrum from you, yet somehow we both feel completely unfulfilled in life by our careers, or in my case lack thereof. That tells you something, doesn't it?\n\nSee, the career, the money, the cars, the degree, it's all icing on the cake. It's not the cake itself. In my own desperate search in this desolate hellscape we call human society, I've realized I will never EVER be happy without one thing, and it sounds cheesy. It sounds hippy. It sounds stupid if you're not open to it. But it's love. You have to focus on what you love in the world, and pursue it like your life depends on it. \n\nThat's the only way i've kept myself sane. I focus on my girlfriend. I focus on the friends I have, the books and shows I love. I focus on my pets. I focus on my hobbies.\n\nSee, the thing is as a kid you're still in love with the world, and as an adult this gets stomped out of us. You have to learn to embrace your inner child. I may be a janitor, but that doesn't mean at night I can't work on Minecraft videos, or that I can't make music and poetry. I can still draw, I can still self educate on topics that have nothing to do with my job. Hell, right now I'm teaching myself physics and set theory just because I think it's fun. And the thing is, those are the happiest times I have. When I sit down and think of how poor I am, and how I probably won't ever be successful or financially secure or how I probably won't ever be able to own my own house, or how I can't even afford to marry my girlfriend because of how damn broke I am, I get depressed. I get hopeless. I'll even let you in on a secret: I get downright suicidal.\n\nThe only answer is to pursue the things you love. If you don't love your job, then focus your mental energy on something you do love. For me, I can't pursue a job I love right now either. So I try to think of it like this: I may be a janitor by day, but I'm an artist by night. Like a secret identity.\n\nLook for ways to have fun. Instead of doomscrolling, go to a meme page. Instead of just throwing all your files away, crumple them all up and see how many you can toss in the basket for a high score. Instead of sitting in silence, put on some music. No really, just put on something anything when youre in the mindset. Don't sit in the silence, it's an echo chamber.\n\nI would recommend pursuing a hobby, maybe getting a pet if you don't have one. Find some new music you like. Try a new restaurant. Just do something--ANYTHING--to break out of your routine. Go out to a park youve never been to. Make some new friends maybe.\n\nAnd in the meantime, since you do have stability, just take your time to really discover what makes you passionate, and take the time to figure out how to pursue it.\n\nAlso thank you for posting this. I actually needed to hear my own advice bc i was depressed after today before i started typing this. Wish you the best brother mane",

      "To be honest, you should stay on the gravy train you're on now until it runs into the ground. \"Boring\" jobs are the best kind because that means there isn't much stress.\n\nThe only reasons you should be looking at a change are if you lose the job and can't get another Sys Admin position or you really want more money.\n\nDo you know how many nurses hate their job? Do you really want to work 12 hours shifts? I just don't want you to do something you'll regret. It might seem \"fulfilling\" now, but after a half a year it might just seem like another job.\n\nOne possibility for you would be to get into a Software Development position that has more human interaction.",
      "Maybe find new hobbies? Take some time off work and travel? Sure there are jobs that may appear to be more fulfilling but every job has it's negatives and positives, It's never a bad thing that you're too good at your job to the point where it becomes boring, talk it over with your wife and maybe friends or strangers who work in that field you're interested in and really see if it's worth jumping ship. The negatives you see now in your current job might turn to positives once you don't have them.\n\nThere's a reason you get paid good money and why tech jobs are so important now, you might not see it as a fulfilling roll within society, but man just look at that tech crash from a couple weeks ago, the whole world nearly shut down because of how important tech is today. Even if it's not your own field, just providing an example.",
      "I want to preface this by saying that sometimes the grass seems greener on the other side. For example I went from being an architect sitting at a desk drafting all day to becoming a building consultant and inspector. My current job is a lot more active and directly fulfilling in seeing my work physically in front of me. However, my current job is so much busier that I feel constantly too tired to do many of my hobbies and am looking to return to a more menial office job with more consistent hours.\n\nEach person has their own experience and for some the career change is exactly what they need while for others it ends up becoming more than what was expected. Only you can make the choice if changing careers is what you want to do to feel more fulfilled.",
      "Fear. \n\nMoney and the security it provides is holding you hostage to being an eternally unhappy wage slave just so you can make your superiors richer. It's the same as holding an actual gun to your head because without money in our capitalist society you would starve and die. Trillions of hours every week are spent by people doing jobs that destroy them physically, mentally, and spiritually because they're held hostage.\n\nImagine having an extremely wealthy portfolio on your deathbed, having lived a life of full regret because you lived your entire life this way. Dead and forgotten forever, having blown your one chance ever to experience all the joys life has to offer. Life's too fucking short to spend most of your waking hours doing what you do. It's fucking sad. If it wasn't for money there is zero chance you'd be doing what you'd be doing right now.",

I went back to school to get my masters in mental health counseling, and now Ill be starting a part-time therapy job alongside my office job. I see the office job as my stable, financially secure role, while the counseling work fulfills me but doesnt provide the financial security I require. Maybe finding a part-time job or volunteering could help you find more meaningful work that impacts others.\n\nAlso, Ive been participating in a lot of recreational sports this summer, which has significantly improved my mental health by keeping me active and helping me connect with others. Finding social hobbies might help you feel more connected, especially if your job is socially isolating.",

It could help with your desire to do something meaningful and point you in the direction of your next move. I used to tutor ESL in my free time and it was so fulfilling. As someone who also was in a hard STEM program (and just quit my job due to workplace harassment and feeling like I have no purpose), it's pointed me towards pursuing teaching. There are many places that desperately need volunteers (animal shelters, homeless shelters, hospitals, food banks, blood donation clinics, firefighting, retirement homes, libraries).

All I'd suggest is research before you commit. Maybe take some career/personality tests. Watch day in the life videos, etc.",

Yes, to have purpose and gratification as well, but community is everything.  \n\nMoney is a tool.  You would be trading in the stresses of this job for a different type of stress at a different job, plus adding financial insecurity on top of that.\n\nMake a list of what you dont like about this job.

Established myself in the community with wonderful people.  It helped a lot, but it wore me out and now Im trying to find a new direction elsewherein my 40s!  \n\nFinding your path wont be easy, but if you are determined, open minded, willing to be vulnerable, ask for help and focus on personal growth, youll be amazed at the people who you will attract.  It sounds so clich, but its true.  You get what you give and people feel that.\n\nLook up effective altruism.

There was no contribution to society or the world whatsoever, just making someones dream come true.\n\nI decided it was enough and am starting a teaching bachelors degree in September. Many people said it would be crazy salary wise, and not worth it. But I want to come home feeling like I helped someone that day. I want to help them learn something that will be useful for their future. I want them to feel like someone understands them in this crazy, fast world we live in nowadays. I want to do something meaningful, even if its underrated and unappreciated.\n\nSo I encourage you to change paths if it makes you happy; its never too late to start anew.",

I would really explore my options before I head into a path that is less secure. \n\nTo many people working a boring - but not soul crushing! -, confortable, high-paying job, while having meaning outside, can bring great satisfaction.",
      "Craziest thing I ever did was join the army.\n\nI'm 23M was a total computer nerd growing up obsessed with building gaming PCs, messing with laptops, learning to code etc. never really went outside much and most my socializing was through game chat. \n\nLanded an IT job at 18 before I finished school (was from rough area when I was younger and missed a few years school till my grandparents adopted me so was always oldest in the class) but then my dad died right before covid and suddenly I had this big realization that I had wasted my entire life on computers and should develop my masculine side more.\n\nEnded up working odd jobs for the last few years but joined the army almost 6 months ago. Worth considering imo just for the challenge. The entire training basically feels like your on a game show with contestant's getting eliminated left right and center in the beginning testing everyone's mental fortitude.

I prefer tech-savvy, nerdy, complex jobs where I have to figure out how things work. I like the cool stuff that feels like black magic to the average person. \n\nI like using my brain and that's more important to me than human interactions. Human interaction is good but I can get that from the church, or the Walmart etc. Human interaction doesn't strictly have to be part of my job. I feel like nursing limits my creativity since it's physicians being responsible for making treatment plans. \n\nOn the flip side, if you feel passionate about nursing, go for it man. We all want different things in life. You could start with an ASN, and those aren't expensive. Your employer could pay for your BSN. \n\nPS: Nursing in my opinion is nowhere near as hard as computer science. Computer science has a lot of abstract concepts and a fair share of higher level math. Nursing is mentally taxing but I wouldn't call it \"hard\" in the intellectual sense, as it doesn't have complex math, organic chemistry etc. It may be harder than business studies, but definitely not harder than computer science. I'm sure you'd do well in nursing school. \n\nGood luck with your career!",

You express the feeling of wanting to see progress at the end of the day.  I know exactly what you mean.  I have almost endless thoughts on this feeling, and it's something that I struggle with, too.  Have you considered something more on the network architect side of things?  Or maybe a pre-sales engineer for a tech firm, where you go in and figure out what equipment they have and what equipment would work for the client?  You'd get to see your vision come into action.  Even if you took a slight paycut, you could consider any number of field technician positions for various tech-related fields, for example, you could work for Comcast or Windstream or something like that.  You're out and about all day, probably some good human interaction.\n\nAlso, what do your hobbies look like?  You are so set right now, you could try out a bunch of different hobbies, and see which one sticks.  Then, you can dive headfirst into whichever one you fall in love with.  You have the money to do just about any hobby you wanted, and because you've solved your career and relationship situations so early in your life, you have tons of space mentally to do something like that.  You have DECADES to become really great at thing, this could be a very fulfilling path if you find something that really aligns with you.\n\nI also struggle with that same \"what's next?\" feeling, and for me, diving into my newish (been at it for a year now) hobby of dancing has been immensely satisfying.

If you don't buy in to the ~new tech~ ~new processes~ and the corporate bullshit it's a drain on the soul. And while it's important to have hobbies outside of your work, I personally don't think it's /bad/ to want better for your career. It's okay to be a little selfish about it. It's your life.

I feel like a failure and I do not know what to do. I graduated with my bachelors in Marketing and worked for almost 5 years making 40k a year, barely scraping by. I had little to do each day, but I was able to leave on time and be home. I decided that I wanted to help people and went back to school for a masters in Occupational Therapy. It was a long, tough process. I've been working for almost a year, saw a bump in pay to 74k, but the system itself is so flawed. I am forced to document outside of work, constantly working with 2 or 3 patients at a time for the entirety of my 8 hour shift. On top of that, I am now 60k in debt, basically living the same life I was before. People have also left me very disillusioned. I work in an ortho clinic and patients are often ungrateful and verbally abusive. All of this along with a terrible commute leaves me with virtually no ability to live a life. I just want to be able to own and take care of a dog, but I can't do that because I'm gone for almost 12 hours a day. Someone please help me. Is there something I can do?

      "Here is what I know- everyone is struggling to find the RIGHT path that checks all the traditional requirements (\"get certified! get a degree in a reliable field! make sure its relevant! Is it over saturared??\") while also trying to find something that won't destroy them in some way (just scroll thru the FindAPath or HealthyGamerGg and other subreddits and see how many young people are suicidal over these issues). The answers on the surface for this are not easy to find- but when dug deeper, the jobs ARE there. The issue comes that when you are looking deeper where all those jobs are, they are very specific to skill sets and where you shine specifically. \nI just feel like there is a strategy that will be specific to you that once you decide on it, it will work with either a doable amount of stress (meaning an amount of stress that you seem is fine for the interim between now and the change you want to see) as well as feeling that the effort you are putting into the path is worth it. \nWhat a lot of people may or may not realize, is that this kind of stuff leads to a lot more issues than just disappointment. It also comes with all that fun stuff of having a lack of confidence in one's own decision process- hence why people post their woes here for any kind of words of guidance. \nBut listen, you don't really need an entirely \"brand new\" career- you just need a pivot/shift into a way of working that can get you to be more into the lifestyle you want/need. \nSo while I don't really feel like choosing an entirely new career is the next best option for you, \nIt's definitely possible that there is a better career for you. That could look like Project Management or Insurance billing, those both tend to be remote by default in a lot of cases and the PM option has medical specific roles. \nBut OP, you have a big set of skills/experience that has been accumulated through your college degrees and the work you have done. \nFirst off, you probably know the answers to these couple of questions already, but do you know 1) if there are any telehealth options for Occupational Therapists, and 2) Is this the type of career that calms down after you have satisfied the hard stuff in the beginning? Because especially for question 2, for example if you got into the subreddit r/therapists, they are all talking about how they can't wait until they are done with initial phases so they can go into private practice, because the agencies or whatever they have to work in initially forces them to take on 50+ patients at one time and they are burning themselves out. So if occupational therapy is hard right Now, does that have an option to settle down or calm down in a later stage. Even if the answer is yes, it doesn't mean you have to take that option as your path/strategy. And remember, this first step is just trying to gather together your OPTIONS. \nAnd as for question 1, telehealth might be available or maybe there is a way for you to consult in your field too. You want to take a look at what other occupational therapists have done, or are looking at that are adjacent to the field. Keep a notebook and write everything down that comes up and comes to mind even if its unrelated to what you're looking at. \nSomething that a lot of people dont think about WHILE they are in a career is, is there anything I can do/create/write a book about/develop an online course on/invent a product that can add value and/or fill an unmet need? That is another way to either forge ones own path into a self-made career, or on a smaller level could be another way to bring in some cash. \nQuestion 3) Is there any way with which it seems doable/ palatable to temporarily lower your cost of living, because sometimes people will downsize to very small for a year and then their cash flow gets put aside so they can go travel or get their next leg up. I am not saying you have to pay off all your debt (debt is super important to deal with, but also, if it's student debt we are talking about then its mostly important to stay current with your payments or deferments) especially student debt, but as long as you arent defaulting on any payments then you dont have to sacrifice your sanity to have a perfectly clear slate. You just need to find ways to give yourself some wiggle room. \nAnother option I dont hear very often is getting a therapist that has business or your field in their history/background. Meaning, go to a talk therapist with the intention that they will help you figure out how to get your life turned around. A lot of times, people only think about someone \"turning their life around\" when its got addictions or crime. But Im of the mindset that we can \"turn our life around\" at any point we find ourselves headed down the wrong path, in any context that might be. So, you might have to pay out of pocket to get that kind of a therapist, but it might be the support you need to feel more confident in your decisions of the next steps. \nSaving cash- this is something that I have seen get people out of their situation. Sometimes its because just having that extra savings gives them the confidence to make a switch or feel like it gives them more options. There's people who have saved money at every turn just so they can buy a house. There is one woman online teaching budgeting, she did this for her house, she challenges that when people say they dont make enough to save that they dont really see all the places that they can save. Again, it's fine if for you this just isn't the case, but I mention it because sometimes when stressed we don't see all the options and its worth mentioning this if it is for you. \nStart looking at resume building and interview processes and advice on them. Im not kidding around when I say that studying/learning this can help your confidence and it also can end up leading you to different things about the careers out there. \nAnd talk to people around you, and in your field, and start networking and getting intel about things. You may find out that people have made switches and changes that you haven't thought of yet- inside and outside the career. \nI didn't mention the marketing, but the steps would apply the same to looking at what's out there for remote jobs in this field. I would also be looking out there for any companies that are at the crossroads of marketing and occupational therapy. For example, maybe there if a software company that was created to be used for Occupational therapists, and they are hiring someone in marketing. But you would never really know because that wont show up on a regular search.\nI hope some of this gives you some ideas on what you could do next!",
      "I empathize with your situation, and I want you to know you're not alone. Part of what you're experiencing is symptomatic of our societal infrastructure in America. We prioritize economic health over individual wellbeing, leaving many feeling dissatisfied despite seemingly 'successful' careers.\n\nOur culture doesn't foster happiness or contentment, sometimes neglecting the human condition altogether. It's a stark contrast when the economy appears to be doing well, but the human experience is suffering.\n\nYour feelings are valid. It's okay to want a better work-life balance and to seek a career that brings you satisfaction. Continue exploring options like analyst courses on Coursera. Your background in Marketing and Occupational Therapy could offer interesting opportunities in a data-driven role.",

      "I've been in your shoes before. I worked in a startup where I ran 12-14 hours per day, mainly doing minimal tasks that \"kept me busy\" instead of being productive. I was burnt out, missing my personal life and life was miserable because of the stress. Then I made a shift to work for a corporation in town. I thought the slower pace would give me more time back in my personal life, but we were required to be ass-in-seat every day, 8-5:30. Then I had an hour commute each way. At the time, I had two little ones and I was missing out on so much of their life. That's when I realized I wanted two things: \n\n* More control over my schedule and pay\n* More time with my family so I didn't miss out on the memories. \n\nSo I made another change, in fact, I made 3 career changes within a 12 month period. I made the changes to progress toward my goal of working for myself. Each job I took presented an opportunity to learn. With each job, I asked questions, worked with individuals I knew would help me with my own business and kept learn. \n\nThen I started side hustles. I started consulting, mainly running projects for small businesses who needed the help. I bankrolled these funds and started to 1) pay off debt and 2) build a cushion. One side hustle turned into multiple! \n\nNow I'm getting close to being able to quit my job, live off of my side hustles, and spend as much time with my family. \n\nI love it because 1) I'm still making decent money, 2) I have control of my life 3) I don't have to deal with people and if I do, it's through email (customer support).

If you go into that with the right mindset and you do 10 years, keep your living expenses minimal since you will not really be home much ( I would treat it like working oil rigs) and then retire from the cat team in 10 years - You could in theory save up 600k - 1M because you would spend all your time on the road and not home spending money. Then you can go do normal stuff working 40-50hrs a week making decent base salary probably in the 70-80k range accounting for inflation.   \n  \nDress code is typically some form of  cargo pants or khakis and a polo shirt.  If you get into management you can dress spiffy if you like but its not a requirement. \n\n  \nI will be honest with you though - its not a career for the feint of heart. You will get yelled at by home owners because they dont read their policy - CTRs tell them their house is going to fall a part if they dont get insurance to pay for things, then a claim is filed for things that arnt covered and with all the pressure and expectations the homeowner has built up - when you tell them things arnt covered - They explode. \n\nWe do try to pay for everything we can find that the policy will cover - however a lot of times - probably a good 50 - 60 percent of all claims filed to day is fluff garbage that contractors are pushing homeowners to file because they need to sell but they cant sell the homeowner so they are hoping an adjuster will pay for it.  If I haven't scared you way yet - Id say look into and see if it fits your needs.",

I saw other comments advising against it, but it really depends what you end up doing.\n\nSocial work is stereotypically working in a therapy setting, or working for child protective services. It does not have to be that at all. Macro social work is an option, and often involves research, advocacy, or policy work. I work in higher education, primarily processing paperwork, but also connecting students with resources, answering questions, helping them decide what to do in school, and helping them prepare to enter their programs. \n\nA friend of mine finished her LCSW, decided she was done working with clients for a while, and now she processes claims for a health insurance company. There are very few fields that could not benefit from having a social worker on staff. HR is an option, teaching is an option (with the correct training and experience), and even tech is an option (VR is becoming very popular on social work).

Welding could be a great option if you like working with your hands and want good pay with minimal schooling. Radiology is a solid choice if youre okay with some education as its more structured and less people-facing. In my experience, people like you thrive in roles that balance independence with clear results, like lab tech work, logistics, or even skilled trades. Id also look into shadowing or entry-level certifications to test the waters before diving in fully. \n\nAnd since youre looking for advice, I think youd find the GradSimple newsletter super helpful. Theyre designed for college grads who are at a crossroads in life and looking for inspiration (and their purpose). So, they interview graduates from all walks of life about their life and career decisions. Many of which talk about about their struggles, career pivots, and share advice. Its a really good way to get a sense of why others made the decisions they did. So, it might be a good source of inspiration!",

I need to leave my current job in July due to health reasons, burnout etc and Im likely making a major move to San Diego after selling my house. Ill have no debt and a little retirement saving momentum (although admittedly I am not independently wealthy). My plan is to focus on my health while teaching music lessons part time, but eventually Id like a full time remote position with benefits. Salary is not a huge concern as I am single with no children and can live a fairly simple lifestyle. Would this institute be apropos for someone like myself? ",

      "Hi there.. Kudos for taking the steps for a major change like that.. It's not easy.\n\n\nYou can do this, but it's going to take time and work. AWS is a fine path. Personally, I'm more of an Azure/365 proponent because it encompasses a larger userbase and is a little easier to break into from starting at near-zero, but that's just me.\n\n\nAny entry level AWS training will give you a leg up over those who are just trying to stumble their way into an entry level role. The nice part about entry level training is it shows you the scope of what is available for next steps and that lights the way to your path in your new career. So will it work? Yes. Will it land you an entry level position? Possibly. Will it make your career? No. You need to finish the entry level work and then follow up with a more advanced cert that will get you ahead of the under achievers. That, coupled with experience, will get you your next 20 years of work, ideally, remotely. The more you specialize, the more you will get paid.\n\n\nHopefully this helps.",
      "You need a plan and that plan needs a guide what to learn. Just learning Azure or AWS or both and getting certs is very limiting. You need all the fundamentals. \n\nSo I would recommend you look at the website\n\nlearntocloud.guide\n\nFollow all the advice there, as it guides you on all the fundamental essentials and also look at roadmap.sh website for additional things to learn in future but don't be scared when looking at roadmap.sh. Hope that helps, it should do. \n\nThe less you know about IT the more difficult it is as a beginner. People see AWS and Azure certs and think they're the answer but apart from very basic certs they are actually designed to be taken by people who experience working with those cloud services. So by studying anything more than AWS CCP or Azure AZ-900 you're not really helping yourself become employable in an efficient manner. You need those fundamentals so please check learntocloud it's a solid fundamentals guide with a guide for suggested projects at each stage.",
      "Throwing IT advice aside for a moment, this is a terrible idea.\n\nFinancially, you are getting rid of all your assets. Have you reached eligibility for a full pension with your time as a teacher? Or are you throwing that away?\n\nYou need to consider your financial status before making a huge jump. Selling your house and then renting is a bad idea.\n\nFrom the way you make it sound, your savings will run out fast and you will have no IT experience to get you in the door.\n\nYeah, teaching experience is one thing, but employers want tech experience as well."

Serious suggestion: LINKED IN. they have recruiters on there that scout all the time. I've talked to serveral people who have a nice remote tier 3 job that got it from linked in recruiter. \n\nAlso figure out a specialization. IT requires some kind of specialized lnowlege if you're trying to get a tier 3 position. Networking? CCNA. Server admin? Decide windows, Linux, and/or cloud. Etc."

I just found out that due to a change in the company structure I will be making a lot less monthly at least for the time being. \n\nI am taking this as a sign that its time to leave.

I went to school back in 2012-2018 but because of me having to work while at school, not enjoying or taking school seriously, and lack of motivation/focus; I never finished any degree. If I remember right, in that time I only officially completed about 35-40 credits of classes that were passing, although Im not sure what my total credits taken was. \n\nRight now Im working in a factory at a great company that I really like and would like to stay at, but just move within different departments. \n\nIve always liked computers, and IT but Im not sure what I necessarily would want to do. Ive dabbled a bit with programming doing a bit of Python, C#, Swift and when I mean a little bit, I mean a little bit. I also did a bit of HTML/CSS back in the day and even made myself a [shitty website](http://www.tylerwarnecke.com) that I havent updated in years. But I had a lot of fun doing it. \n\nI also have half of my COMPTIA A+ done, Core 1 done in August of 2022, and just kind of slacked off on getting the other half done. Part of that is Im primarily a Mac user and dont have a Windows computer to use to test things directly on. So any recommendations on a decent Windows laptop to start out on would be great. I want a laptop because I cant build my own PC right now. \n\nI havent decided if I want to take online guided or self taught courses (like Udemy or Udacity) or enroll back into school, but then I dont know if I would do online (like WGU) or a traditional school like my local tech college. I feel like with online schooling Id get distracted, and lack the motivation and help to complete it, but with traditional school I feel like I might do better because Id most likely have to go in person and physically be there. But regardless I fear that I might end up in the same situation as I was a decade ago. \n\nAnd advice would be greatly appreciated",

      "The short route, finish up your COMPTIA stuff.  This should give you some basics and some ability to do some things.\n\nNobody is going to hire you if you can't do anything that they need.  Nobody is going to hire you just because you want to work in IT.\n\nWhen you interview, you need to be able to tell/show them what you can do for them.  Oftentimes, experience can prove this.  If you don't have any experience yet, that's okay.  You will need to convince them that you are trainable, you are eager to learn, and that you can do the job.  Educational experience with a certification or degree can help prove this.\n\nGood luck !",
      "Acer Swift 3 is cheaper and reliable. Amazon sells used ones for under 600 I think. As far as moving up in your company, you will want to determine what you want to do. IT is a very large bubble encompassing many departments. Learn more about those specific departments within IT and figure out which of those you want to go into. From there, research what employers look for and go after it. Talk to HR and show you are making these efforts to move up into that department of IT within your business and see what they would want from you/if they need any positions filled. IT is great because there are many specifications. For example, if you want to get into the network side of things then you can work on the Security+, Network+, CCNA, and more. Programming itself has some cool certifications. You might have to start lower on the totem pole (help desk) but getting your foot in the door is everything.",
      "I saw you like your current employer, but based on your situation, I'd suggest looking for entry-level positions in local government, small non-profits, and schools, especially elementary schools. \n\nLocal government positions will often allow you to substitute experience for education or credit hours, even if you have not finished the degree -- *call and talk with their recruiting or HR department to find out specifics.* Also, since the government pays less than the private sector, they tend to have to be more open to indirect hires (i.e., people like yourself who may not have all the specific skills or experience yet).\n\nSmall non-profits tend to have small budgets so, as with goverment, they sometimes have to be more open to taking a chance or being flexible with their hires. Depending on your free time, you could also potentially volunteer and gain some experience with IT that way.\n\nFinally, I specifically say elementary schools because they often have a simple IT setup, which means their entry-level position requirements can be less strenuous. Also, the education sector still loves Apple/Macs, so being more experienced with macOS helps you there.\n\n---\n\nOn a related note, before you interview, I encourage you to have a simple and honest explanation for why you did not complete your degree and have not gone back to finish, at the ready. It's reasonable for an interviewer to ask, and a simple honest answer is the best route, in my opinion. *Also, sometimes an interviewer may press you on your answer, rare and rude, but it can happen, so be ready for that with a simple response.*\n\nI'm not saying you would be that blunt, that you lacked focus and motivation, but that response will hurt you in an interview. I would consider presenting along the lines of \"*I was working and going to school at the same time and was getting worn out with the workload and costs, so I put the degree on hold.\"* Based on what you said, I feel like that is honest (although I don't know for sure) and, if I was interviewing someone, would accept that as a reasonable answer."

Computers do not experience life.  \n\nWhat looks like advice to you is just a sentence the model pieces together using a map of statistical weights that computes how likely a word is to follow the word before it based on its training data.

      "I do have a different opinion not focused on the market. First, learn to code. If you can and you enjoy it, know that working for a paycheck doing it will drain some of the enjoyment. So, with that out of the way, look into a Computer Science degree. You may even be able to completely one fully online. If this is not an option then I would start working on a portfolio or building and launching your own apps. Regardless if you do a CS degree or not that's a good way to start.\n\nAfter that it's just a matter of getting your foot in the door. The easiest way is to join a consulting or development shop that makes websites and apps for clients. The pay is low and the demands are high but that's the easiest way to get into software development. Two years there making apps over and over for clients will give you some really solid experience. From there on the sky is the limit. You just have to always be learning new processes, technologies and keeping up to date with the industry and trends. The people complaining here saying there are no jobs are correct, but that may (or may not) change in a year or two, or more. The people here also complain because they can't easily get a job paying 150k+ a year anymore at big tech, not because they can't get a job for peanuts in a sweatshop (at least not yet) but that's where you'll need to start unless you are extremely luck and talented at the same time.\n\nMore likely than not, you'll get stuck in the first step and give up. That's usually how it goes. If you can't learn to code on your own with all the available resources out there online then this field is probably not for you.

      "> Im thinking of leaving the PM life as there hasnt been any growth and several cuts in the last couple years. Not to mention severe burn out. (Thats a rant for another time).\n\nCould you expand on this a bit more? Your experiences might shed insight on those wanting to do a PM job in tech. Thanks!\n\nAlso, if I were you, this is the plan that I'd follow (we are basically in similar situations):\n\n* Look into certificates on Coursera and/or Edx. Learn from here and start building a portfolio.\n\n* Similar to the above, check out theodinproject.com, freecodecamp.org, fullstackopen.com, and roadmap.sh\n\n* Study algorithms and data structures. Check out /r/leetcode and leetcode.com and start grinding right now. If you enjoy this, also check out janestreet.com/puzzles\n\n* I haven't actually looked into it myself a whole lot yet, but consider the [O'Reilly Online Learning] (https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/individuals.html) service. They have a lot of good books so it might be worth having access to all of them. \n\nAnd finally, as other's have mentioned\n\n* Consider or plan for a master's degree in CS or something related. Good options for people that can't take time off exclusively for school: UT Austin's Online Masters of Computer Science, Georgia Tech's OMSCS, Harvard Extension School Online CS (very expensive but you'll be an official Harvard alum after completing it (not a HC alum mind you)). Start by taking online community college CS classes to get accepted into UT's or GT's program(s). \n\nThe market is brutal right now. So unless you have special connections or a very impressive resume, it will be very hard to get interviews. You are already starting off disadvantaged without a CS degree. It will be even harder to get an offer after you start interviewing too. \n\nOnce you start interviewing, aim for non-remote jobs as those are less competitive. Aim for rural or non-tech centered locations. Aim for non-profits or government jobs as the competition for those jobs isn't as high compared to big tech or finance. If you have another citizenship, consider looking for work outside of the US too. \n\nGood luck!\n\nedit: added more"

Also its very competitive if not impossible to land first job as SWE but dont expect 200k salary, specially if you dont have a degree.

However from the very beginning I told myself I would not consider anything less than $120k and as you can imagine that has made finding a job a little bit more challenging.

Another thing to consider is that you might also be able to use those acquired skills in your current job. Hope this helps.

      "Long post incoming, feel free to ask even more questions or want me to expand on anything. I love rambling, especially to help people.\n\n**TL;DR** test the waters and see if you like it, if you like it make the switch but please please please keep your expectations within reason!\n\nFirst of all, great job on what you have accomplished so far! You are clearly smart and a hard worker so I'd say you have an aptitude for this. Between you and me, I would kill to have 175k as an accountant, it's an extremely stable career with straightforward growth whereas with cs right now we are sort of in a hyper tech bubble (though it might not pop for a while!) May I ask how chill is your day to day and if you find your self being \"bored\" (this is a plus to me lol) I would find both equally as boring too be honest since to me a job is a job and a means to live life. Programming to me gets soul-crushing after a while since it's less about being creative and more about just busting out tickets and doing what you are expected to do. Programming is something I love but the whole corporate aspect of it is something I'd never enjoy.\n\nAnother thing to note is the reality of these salaries and how competitive the field is for entry-junior level. Most people dont actually make close to 175k starting out so it might take you a little bit to reach back there. But if you can get into big tech and study your ass off for the interviews it can be possible to get there eventually especially since you live in NYC (but again this is top % of people, reddit is just it's own bubble with people who have these jobs getting upvoted the most).\n\nAll these posts you see about software being in demand they will hire anyone is actually for mid-senior levels who have experience already. The entry level market is super saturated with degrees, boot camps, and self taught people since it is a hot field at the moment. To put into perspective it took me months and hundreds and hundreds of applications after getting my degree (4.0 gpa) with internships to still land anything and some of my friends even took non-paying internships to build up experience (these are the guys who didnt do much in school though). The job market in NYC is indeed competitive but at least you wont have to deal with the lower end 60k salaries for the most part.\n\nNow going by the median for entry level and junior engineers (averages are skewd by super elite trading firms and big tech) you can still expect 80-90K all the way to 6 figures (for tech and fintech) if you put in a decent amount of work and have a solid portfolio. Even senior level medians are around 175-200K for most companies that aren't big names. Everyone is going to say im dumb and you can join amazon and google for 150K-200K+ right off the bat (this isn't a base salary but with RSU and bonus) but this is just simple statistics, only the top percentile works for these companies and that's not going to be a VAST majority of people. These interviews are both hard to get and pretty hard to pass statistically and for me personally super luck based, but certainly doable just don't expect EVERY job is like that. To explain why these interviews are hard just know that when getting a programming job you have to take a technical interview, sort of like a final exam for finals week which tests your coding skills with word problems of various difficulties. You have to set aside a good chunk of your day for these rounds, (mine was 4 hours). A lot of the time these problems require \"tricks\" and repetition to really know the pattern and know which tool to use at which times. I say it was luck based because the questions you get could be the same type of question (similar algorithm used) you crammed the night or even the hours before.\n\nI wouldn't quit my job right away til I had a decent job lead after finding out if you really do like this and want to make the switch. The main important take away is to see if YOU would like it. Make sure you actually do a deep dive and not just do basic coding 101 things and think \"this is super easy, I love this.\" Trust me every beginner coding tutorial is going to make you feel like a child can do it because the beginning is purely snytax and easy logic! Honestly, if you want I could DM some of the best textbooks (for free dont worry) to help you with the most important part of CS which is the actual algorithms portions.\n\nAs for not going back to school, you certainly don't NEED a degree in this field with enough projects and hard work but the degree itself does make it easier to get an actual interview in a sea of candidates that all decided to go into the CS major (it is the fastest growing major). Bootcamp was and can still be a decent path but it became a bit saturated where the actual certificate doesn't mean much. Some of the better known boot camps (using the HR bootcamp as an example) have gotten less and less placements over the years so I personally would try to self-study as much as you can (online resources provide just as much structure as a bootcamp these days) to see if you like it rather than dropping the $20K.\n\nIt is 100% possible to make a switch but as for if it's \"worth\" is really up to you! If you're in it for more money / challenging work you could also see which career paths you can branch out from accounting that will give you an easier time switching as well, but if you fall in love with programming it can certainly be worth to switch. The hours depend on the company but usually it can be pretty chill. As a matter of fact I would rather have a low challenge, more autopilot which is why i'd love a \"boring\" accountating job where I just grind out hours and make money while doing other stuff on the side. So when searching for companies I usually look for the ones that are \"boring\" (rest and vest) and I can chill out. But places like AMAZON will pay you a TON of money if you pass their interview but you'll end up working hard for 10-12+ hours a day if you are in AWS. The reason people pick AMAZON over something like lets say GOOGLE is faster promotion (google seems to low ball your skill level to get you a lower pay if you're mid-senior level), and AMAZON hires (and fires) more people yearly compared to the other FAANGs so you'll see people who didn't get into one of the others go there."

      "** Passers-by should read the comments under this one. Good discussion.\n\n*** A lot of people are mentioning that Trilogy stinks. Honestly, you can find such opinions/warnings about literally every bootcamp.

They're not gospel.\n\n> At this point my goals are working from home, 9-5, Monday - Friday, no weekends, no holidays.\n\nThis is not an unreasonable ask, in my experience.\n\n> With the pandemic I know many people went from office workers, to work at home. Is this likely to continue? Or is there a large push to return to the office?\n\nThere is a large push from corporate leadership for \"return to office\". I don't have a crystal ball, but I'd bet on the companies that are pushing for \"return to office\" getting their way. Companies that were remote-first before the pandemic will probably remain remote-first.\n\nAny position that is fully remote is going to be ***incredibly*** competitive compared to any given on-site position. You will be competing with the best of the best for many of those spots.\n\n> Are the hours consistent yet flexible?\n\nThat's going to depend on specific corporate cultures.\n\nI get to be pretty flexible with my team. Peers/friends at other orgs, not so much.\n\n>  Ive read people often times work early or late based on their own discretion.\n\nI would not use \"often\" to qualify that arrangement. Most companies are going to have \"core hours\" during which all of the synchronous work (alignment/planning meetings, pairing, etc) happens.\n\n> How many hours a week is normal?\n\nSome figure less than or equal to 40. \n\n> Or is there a lot of forced overtime?\n\nOvertime isn't usually a thing in typical product development focused teams. [SRE](https://sre.google/)/DevOps/Ops flavored roles can involve on-call rotations. I rarely hear about anything as nuts as the 70-80 hour weeks I hear about in bedside care. Those sort of \"sky is falling, all hands on deck\" incidents happen maybe once per year at my company. YMMV.\n\n> How important are the degrees and certifications in this industry?\n\nBootcamps can be a viable alternative to those lacking in the time or money to pursue an undergraduate program. I cannot provide you a list of \"the good ones\" -- bootcamps are not accredited, very wild-west. If you have an existing relationship with a college/university that offers a [Trilogy](https://www.trilogyed.com/) based program, those are generally OK but come at a premium. They are absolutely not a replacement for an undergraduate program. \n\nThere are some companies, particularly those who pay top dollar, who will not give you the time of day without a completed CS/related undergraduate degree.",
      "Its doable for anyone with the tenacity to try. \n\nThere are a few things to consider before making this decision. Namely, the entry level market is flooded. Whether new grads, bootcampers, or self taught devs, getting your first gig will not be easy. Your best chances are at a place that has poor reviews and churns through developers (a beggars cant be choosers mentality will go a long way). Then, stay long enough to get experience that will bolster your job search and income. In 3.5 years I tripled my initial salary. Also, because the market is nuts, remote jobs will likely be harder for you  to come by. You have to be realistic, Will a company hire you with no experience or someone else you has moderate experience for the same amount?\n\nAnother caveat that Ive recently discovered is that while a lot of places are now offering remote positions, if youre in a HCOL (which is the case for me), remote companies will pay what is relative to their market. For me thats a 40k discrepancy. \n\nIn regards to hours, the places that Ive been at have a general business hours but my direct managers have been flexible with my schedule. One gig allowed me to work from 6-2, which helped me beat the DC rush hour. Getting up at 5 was worth the 4 extra hours in the afternoon that I got to spend with my family. \n\nAs for degree, bootcamp, or other, Im self taught. I would love to go back to school and get the brick and mortar stuff, but its difficult to find the time and now that Ive been in the field for almost 4 years, it isnt really necessary. Though I didnt have much flexibility in the path that I chose; I left a job and was out of work. A degree was too expensive and would take too long and a bootcamp was also too expensive for me. In total I spent less than 2k to teach myself enough to get my first job and that included 1100 for a new computer. The longer you wait, the more crowded the market will become. The most important thing you can do is start coding and learning and see if its what you want to do before you make the life changing decision to change careers.",
      "It's viable. 9-6 is more common. You may have on call as well, but nothing remotely as intense as nursing at a hospital. I've never been a nurse.

A software job is much much easier IMO.\n\nMy recommendation if you have a bachelor's is to do OMSCS at Georgia Tech. A nurse likely wouldn't need leveling to qualify. You should obviously do some online learning to code courses, but you will have time before they admit you to do that. It's cheap, online, flexible and legit.",

I would actually try and learn on your own first, then interview and see how does it go. An entry level knowledge for web development can be done in 6 months.

      "Im a RN learning the MERN stack right now with the help of my fiance who is a SWE. Therefore, I don't have any advice as far as whether a degree vs bootcamp is better. But I just want to say I so resonate with the burnout in nursing. \n\nI know a lot of people here are saying \"the money is good!\" Or \" go travel nursing!\" But I TOTALLY understand where you are coming from. \n\nI've been a nurse for 6 years and I'm done with caring for the general public. Nursing is a damn hard job that some people (like myself) are not cut out for in the long run. I can't fathom doing this for another 30+ years. Covid is the cherry on top, when I got deployed last year to night shift covid ICU for 3 months, ratios were 1:3 or 1:4 in the icu, and management was canceling scheduled staff vacations. Oh and can't forget about the 1% raise and two tier pay system they tried to enforce on us this year, which we fought against and won (Thank God for unions). \n\nPeople who are not nurses don't and won't understand. For me, I even feel shame in calling in sick and refusing to work overtime. Even executing my exit plan to leave this career is making me feel guilty. I feel shame for getting annoyed by my patients who are so difficult to deal with (addicts, entitlement, demanding, verbally abusive, you know the rest..). As a nurse you see the best and worst in people. The worst rubbed off on me and I would carry that negative energy home. That's how much this job rubbed off on me. Again, this is case by case. Not every nurse is like me. Maybe I just need to not take it personally and grow some balls.\n\nThat's my personal experience with nursing. And there are days when I have really great patients. I realize that I have one life to live and that I want to have a career that allows me to urinate when I want to, work from home, have a full hour of lunch, have autonomy, be creative and heck, use my PTO that I earned! Anyhoo, enough of the negativity :). I'm enjoying learning about algorithms, data structures and specifically javascript for now. Hope whichever direction you take, you at least won't have any regrets not trying!",
      "If you have the time/money I recommend a bachelors over a bootcamp. Bachelors will give you the opportunity to get internships which make getting a full time job incredibly easier as well as build your confidence with software development. Second, taking the time to learn the fundamentals is important but it also sounds like it will give you a break from the nursing burnout, where as a bootcamp is incredibly fast paced and stressful and doesnt offer as much depth. Further, universities will open up feeder pipelines into big companies that hire lots of students from them, which is a pretty smooth transition into a first job. \n\nA lot of people are only focusing on money but arent considering the cost of your mental health. Does traveling nursing make a lot more? Sure, but is it sustainable? You can make as much as you do as a traveling nurse as an SWE around mid-career if you are reasonably driven. Its not as if the entry level salaries at around 80k a year will leave you destitute. If nursing was your passion there are plenty of biotech and medical companies that would love to have someone with your background so you may even be able to skip right over the entry level pay bands. \n\nSide note: avoid hospital SWE jobs as they pay very poorly for some reason, I never understood how places like Cardinal Health have so much money but pay developers terribly.",

Or is there a large push to return to the office?\n\nThere is a large push to return to the office. Remote work is still significantly more common but there is a large push to return to the office. Pointless mid-level micromanaging terrors hate remote work. Lots of jobs are being listed as remote but are not actually remote.\n\n> Are the hours consistent yet flexible?\n\nVaries wildly. Crunch time around release is common. On-call (usually via rotation) is also common. Some companies are much, much better about WLB than others. And within each company there is variance between teams.\n\n> How important are the degrees and certifications in this industry? Would you recommend one or the other?\n\nThey're not that important, but significantly more important than the nursing world. There's a lot to say about this topic... I highly suggest searching.\n\nThe grass isn't always greener on the other side. My wife is doing travel nursing now and making big bucks. Plus she has quite a lot of flexibility in her schedule. Yes, there are draining days or weeks for her... but it's the same in the software world. She might have zero downtime due to having a few heavy patients just the same as I may have zero down time due to a half dozen people trying to compete for the 60 free minutes I have today.",

      "Anything is viable, if you want to become a dev, you can do it even with a medical background. You also dont need to go to school for it. Yes, developers will likely be mostly work from home in the future because development is such a deep work type of job and can be done anywhere. Ive also actually found WFH to be more productive for me and have had no issue getting to know my coworkers online. Developers are salaried most of the time and the bigger companies usually have a pretty good work life balance. I know plenty of devs who really only work 3-5 hrs a day sometimes less or more depending on the the week. Its not like the medical field, in terms of hours, its pretty relaxed compared to what youre used to. Degree is helpful especially in CS to get your foot in the door next would be maybe a boot camp or some certifications. The biggie would be having projects on GitHub and adding those projects to your resume. If I were you, I would just start doing tutorials and saving them to GitHub. You can learn plenty just through that. I would say probably the most useful certs are for one of the cloud providers, I know there is one for docker too. There is also the Cisco ones as well. Boot camp would probably be the quickest route because you have no tech experience tbh",
      ">At this point my goals are working from home, 9-5, Monday - Friday, no weekends, no holidays.\r  \n\r  \nSo my first questions are, how viable is this? With the pandemic I know many people went from office workers, to work at home. Is this likely to continue? Or is there a large push to return to the office?\n\nA lot of this will depend on your company/industry. Some areas will be a bit more laid back. Perhaps places like government, non-profits. I assume non-profits don't pay as well, but perhaps you care more about **who** you work for vs other things like compensation. I've spent a lot of time in agency/consulting, and those types of companies can have pretty large spikes in hours. Things like poor planning, unexpected issues (think about some of the bug/exploits you hear about in the news, you might be responsible for patching Production and then going back to your original work). What happens if Production crashes? Depending the severity and your role, you might be spending a lot of hours trying to restore things. Probably the two biggest things that cause people to freak out is lives at stake and money. I'll let you decide which is more important, but there's definitely people that will vote the latter. Other companies, outside of emergencies, will be a lot more reasonable with expectations. You'll just have to see or research (and ask questions during interviews). My current job has been generally pretty laid back even thought it's consulting. It's primarily due to the client and the scope of work. I probably had 2-3 days since October where I worked really late into the night, but some of that was by choice.\n\nFor working at home, I think there will be considerably more full-time remote positions than there were pre-pandemic. A lot of companies are considering doing some type of hybrid approach whenever the pandemic ends. This might mean 2-3 days a week in the office. The truth is, no one really knows right now. Everyone is different. Some people love this. I've changed jobs twice during the pandemic, and full remote has made learning about a new company a lot harder. I mostly only know people on my project team, and I hardly got to know any senior and mid-level management. You don't get the incidental contact you used to. Some people are fine with this. I don't miss my commute, but it's definitely more isolating than it used to be, and I think career progression will be harder if you are fully remote. Some of that will depend on your company/team culture, though. I spent an hour speaking to a new person on our team, go over a the codebase on a video conference today. I spent another hour speaking to another engineer on the team, talking about some potential design/architecture options. I really enjoyed that, because most days, I've only been talking to people 15 minutes during a daily status meeting. Again, this will vary a lot from company-to-company, project-to-project.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Regarding pursuing this objective, Ive seen various discussions about university vs bootcamps. How important are the degrees and certifications in this industry? Would you recommend one or the other?\n\nIf you can afford it, my assumption is that a university program will teach you more. There are 1-2 year programs, I believe. One thing that really draws people to this industry, though, is the low barrier to entry. There are plenty of people who are self-taught or took a bootcamp. Entry level seems to be pretty competitive, though, as there are a lot of people looking to break into the industry these days.\n\nYour actual degree doesn't matter that much. In some cases, some companies will have an HR department that might filter you out if you don't have a degree, but once you're actually working, most people won't care. In general, I think people say certifications don't matter. The one exception I've been seeing (and some people have disagreed with me recently on this) are some of the cloud certifications. A lot of companies are pushing their employees to get these lately. For consulting companies, the more employees they have certified, they can get improved status with the vendor, and that can leads to projects.\n\nIt's a good field, there have been some bumps along the way. When covid first hit, some companies got hit \\***really**\\* hard, and there were actually websites tracking layoffs/furloughs. If you were asking this question in August 2020, a lot of people would probably say they really weren't sure what was going to happen. It rebounded very strongly, and most people feel pretty comfortable with things these days. \n\nGood luck, it's always scary (exciting?) trying something new. I hope you find something that works for you, even if it's not programming. Feel free to ask more questions if you have them.",
      "2.5 YOE here but talk a lot with friends at other companies and am pretty in touch with industry.\n\n\nI would say most work 45 hrs or less including myself (40 or less for me)\n\nThere are a ton of remote jobs now. It's honestly moving towards the norm since it cuts a lot of costs.\n\nRarely weekends except an occasional here and there.\n\nDegree is not really important for most positions and neither are certifications.\n\nProjects to put on your resume (and initially grades) will get you interviews. Talking well about those projects (design decisions, root cause analysis of defects, etc) and doing well in the technical interviews will get you offers. Although there are jobs where technical interviews are not very demanding so I wouldn't fret, you can initially shoot for those jobs, they still pay well, just not as well as the ones that wreck you during the interviews.\n\nFor a 35 year old that probably wants to expedite things I wouldn't do a bachelors. It's also important to provide how much CS or programming experience you have. Assuming you have none, I would\n\n1) self study a course or a couple . Let's say CS50 online + web developer boot camp in Udemy by colt steele\n\n2) after doing those, I would then think about the bootcamo\n\nThe reason is because you may not like it, and even if you do, a boot camp pace is way too fast to get a ton out of it with little prior experience. Taking those two courses before hand will make it more worthwhile.\n\nI personally wouldn't spend 4 years on a degree unless you can get it in 2 years due to previous BS. Then it starts becoming a competing option",
      "> At this point my goals are working from home, 9-5, Monday - Friday, no weekends, no holidays.\n\nI'd say there are a couple challenges to fully achieving this:\n\n1. Most jobs have at least a partial on-call component\n2. If you're new you're going to get stuck playing catch-up after-hours.  This will slow down if you're with it for a while, but you'll be starting from the beginning.\n\nIf you think you'd like programming, by all means, go ahead, but expect there to be some level of grind there.  Probably not as extreme as what you're used to but I'm not sure about reaching your stated goal.",

    "content": "Hi everyone,\n\n**TL:DR: Based on the 5 experiences below, should I change teams, companies, careers, or stay put. Sorry for the long post. (if I should take it down, just let me know)**\n\nSo, I was really hoping to get some advice here. I've been a developer for quite some time, and it has been something of a rollercoaster ride for me. There may be some underlying issues that I've been ignoring, but I was hoping that maybe you guys could help me identify those. My career thus far has been both good and bad, but even in school, it was the same.\n\nThe goal of this post isn't to bash my previous teams, but I truly wonder if anyone has had this much fluctuation in their career path as an engineer. Sometimes, I wonder if this is actually a common occurrence in software development careers, or if this is just a team/company issue. More so now than ever, I've considered switching careers, because it truly seems like it will be a constant.\n\nI've presented 5 distinct experiences so far just so you'd have context. \n\nI would really appreciate anyone's advice, feedback, or guidance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**College:**\n\nSo, in college, I was a Mathematics major. I grew up loving math, and I loved all that you could do with it. However, I learned very quickly that once we got to the proof-based courses (all the others were fine), it was as it I just couldn't think in the same language as my professors. I didn't do very well, but I managed to get by. I also picked up a minor in Computer Science, which was fun with the exception of the OS-level courses. I simply loved how creative I could be with it. So, I pursued a career in software engineering.\n\n**First Job:**\n\nMy first job as a software engineer was both good and bad. I got creative projects and I got to make changes that people around the world could see. I was 100% the \"UI-guy\" at this point, because our previous UI specialist had left the company. I had a role, and it was great. I could be creative at work, and help millions of people. Eventually, we had a re-org, and this put me on a new team, where UI work was not at all something they cared about. More often than not, I found myself in situations where I was asked \"why don't you know this?\" or \"why do you keep looking up how to do things instead of memorizing them?\" This was usually in reference to OS-based things. I tried my best to be useful in every other way I could be, including going through our customers feedback and identifying how we could make our product more useful. I was then presented with the statement, \"sometimes, even if we know we can do something to improve the customer's experience, we simply don't because it means they will pay for our service longer waiting for it.\" I'm not sure why, but this statement bothered me so much, so I left for a new job.\n\n **Second Job:**\n\nMy second job was as a SRE/DevOps Engineer. It seemed like a great opportunity since I could essentially help both the company and the people with it. I could be creative and build tools that hopefully, would benefit everyone. However, while I got to program/code to some degree, most of my job was watching dashboards and rerouting phone calls. Eventually, some of the team took to watching movies or playing video games all shift (and in some cases, bring in their drones) whenever the manager wasn't there due to the sheer amount of down time they had. I quickly watched my team grow in frustration with the way the team was managed, and over my time there, 75% of my team had either left or had been fired (largely due to growing disgruntlement with the way things were). My manager frequently skipped my 1 on 1's with him and eventually, it came to a point where I'd only see him at bi-monthly intervals. I become something of a heads down programmer on the team, building random project and random project, hoping that eventually, someone would pick something up. Finally, I realized no one would, because I was the only one who could code and was willing to. I don't know if my code was good or bad. I just knew everyone was disinterested. So, I tried to move back to a software development team.\n\n**Third Job:**\n\nMy third job was something of a relief for me. I got to develop for a customer facing set of services, and I truly don't think I've ever been so happy for an extended period of time working in my life. There were always things to learn, always ideas to be discussed. and always opportunity for improvement. I think 90% of what I learned as a developer today, was through that team. I did everything I could for the team, and ultimately got a promotion for it. That said, it didn't matter that I got a promotion, because I simply loved the job. Additionally, it was through this job I realized the importance of negotiation of your salary. Mine had been so far off the mark that my team/manager grew concerned for me and fixed it (this was a huge fix). For the first time ever, I felt like I was in a place where I cared about the work, and my team cared about my input. I even led a few projects here and there as well. I truly envisioned staying with the company forever, and potentially becoming an engineering manager at some point because of it. The sheer amount of support I received was phenomenal. However, when COVID-19 hit, of course this shook things up a bit, leading to another re-org.\n\n**Fourth Job:**\n\nFor the first time, even though this was my second re-org, I often wondered why I was placed were I was. I often asked why at this point. Before my official start on my new team, I learned that I would be joining a failing, politically-corrupt team; that the current members of the team refused to teach, learn, or share any new information, because with doing so, it meant their jobs would be in jeopardy of being taken by younger developers. This was a team the entire company needed, but seemed to hate working with. I don't think I truly understood this at the time. That said, I learned why I was put on the team. I learned that I was put on the team solely because I was a DevOps Engineer in the past (work that I grew to hate by this point). The entire goal was to get people together to transform this team, despite expecting some of the other engineers there to push bad. Our tech stack was incredibly old, and the previous team members where clearly specialists. No one was willing to learn anything new. Only the newer members tried. This team was so under water, that asking anyone for help seemed like a huge burden on them. That said, what we heard, was in fact the case. The team eventually was split down the middle as ops and automation. Eventually, the team functioned as separate parts. It eventually became all about systems design and pushing for ideas that we could never get an unanimous decision on (almost always 50/50). Eventually, I had stopped coding entirely, and a bulk of my job had become manual labor (yes, turning devices on and off). I have been a \"software engineer\" for several months on this team, but I've never felt so distant from it. So, as you'd expect, I decided to leave to a more development centric team.\n\n**Today:**\n\nI am posting this because I genuinely want some advice on how to proceed.",

Their management is kick-ass and good management attracts good individual contributors. You should find a job at FAANG or equivalent. \n- Understand that no job is perfect. In fact maybe you should even write down what is a good job in your definition (in as precise terms as possible), and decide whats a must have, good to have, deal-breaker etc. \n- I dont agree that you need to switch careers. You need to find a company where people are either passionate or really fucking professional. This could also be a small startup.

      "> My manager frequently skipped my 1 on 1's with him and eventually, it came to a point where I'd only see him at bi-monthly intervals. I become something of a heads down programmer on the team, building random project and random project, hoping that eventually, someone would pick something up. Finally, I realized no one would, because I was the only one who could code and was willing to. I don't know if my code was good or bad. I just knew everyone was disinterested.\n\nThe DevOps Experience in a nutshell right there.",

Depending on how good your current manager is you might or might now want to share that with them.

    "content": "So, I've been at my current company for almost 6 years now. It's a big multi-national corporation and I've had the chance of moving laterally across different Business Units and coding in different projects. For the past 3 years I've been working on this BU where I've moved up from SW Eng to a SW Architect (which is basically more design / technical roadmap & mentoring than actual coding).\n\nThe problem is that I've hit the ceiling- in terms of learning and career progression.  Let me explain. For better or worse, I believe I know the current product inside-out and there are no new things for me to learn. Also, even my slightest attempt to introduce new tech, that would improve some of our performance issues, gets blocked by management due to business priorities... In addition, there's no other technical position above my current one that I could move up to (the company is more management oriented when it comes to carving out employees' career paths) and moving to another BU is (for the time being) not feasible.\n\nOn the other hand there are some good things stemming from my current situation. For one, there's no stress at all. I'm totally autonomous, work on my own pace and have no LM pushing deadlines down my throat. Of course, there are project deadlines but my point is that I'm handling them myself- don't have a manager above my head constantly asking for updates and what not. This situation leads to me having a great deal of freedom in the way I work also allowing me to work remotely (even pre-COVID19) whenever I want. This also leads to me being able to completely shut off when I log off and not work outside my normal working hours (I mention this as an advantage because I understand that this is a huge deal in our industry).\n\nAs the title says I'm torn as to what my next step should be. That's why, in an effort to maybe clear things up a bit,  I'm seeking other experienced devs' input on my situation.\n\n**Option #1:**\n\n\\- Stay at my current job. This would allow me to (probably) coast for the rest of my time here and enjoy a totally autonomous, relaxed, low-stress way of life; three elements that are not that easy to find in the industry. As far as the cons go, well, they were pretty much explained above.\n\n**Option #2:**\n\n\\- Move to a new company as an Engineering/Tech Manager. This option would capitalize on the skills I've gained in my current position (tech management of a distributed team, people and tech managing of teams etc). **Pros**: More pay (for some reason management pays more, on avg, than a technical role), more autonomy than a s/w eng. position; better chances of climbing that career ladder as more positions are available to managers (I'm a type A personality...); more impact (?) as I will have a saying on key product/strategy decisions; less stress than an IC (I'm not really sure of this but I think that,on average, the stress of actually building the product is less than managing the guys who build the product); pay is more than an IC **Cons:** I'm not really sure that spending most of my day in meetings and creating ppt presentations will make for an interesting day to day job; not that many open positions for eng. management where I live (this means that If one gets fired there won't be many other similar jobs to go to); Less flexibility than IC in terms of remote work, time off, leave etc\n\n**Option #3:**\n\n\\- Move to a new company as an IC. **Pros:** Will learn new stuff/technologies and day to day will be more interesting than being a manager; More flexibility wrt working from home, working hours etc; Not (much) overtime; Because of the previous points, I reckon that my way of life will be more stable (in contrast to being a manager where there's a tendency to work past 5/6pm); generally, I like experimenting with new technologies and I like implementing mini projects on my spare time so I think by doing that professionally, it'll be a good use of my time **Cons:** less pay than a manager (again this is due to the country/market I'm in), will probably not be that much autonomous due to having a manager above my head and will for sure not be that much autonomous as I currently am, I think that the rush from using new technologies, and building exciting stuff will eventually fade away and in the long run this position will end up being only about fixing bugs. This means that I'll eventually have to move to a new job thus being part of a huge rat race; higher stress- associated with having to keep up with deadlines; unless this job's about a product/service that I'll be heavily invested in (slim chances), I think I'll not be having such big of an impact and will be just another cog in the wheel; I believe I won't ever be *that* good so as to climb to any position. This is due to the fact that there are other devs who are better than me and will have more experience in the new company. So indeed another cog in the wheel...\n\nSo, experienced developers of this sub-reddit, what would you do If you were in my shoes? Any advice? Have you ever been in a similar situation?",

      "Moving into management because it seems like the logical next step is the absolute worst move you can make.  I did it for 2 years, was miserable, and am now back to an IC and couldn't be happier.\n\n> less stress than an IC (I'm not really sure of this but I think that,on average, the stress of actually building the product is less than managing the guys who build the product);\n\nYou couldn't be more wrong.  You have all of the responsibility of building things and not much control over it.  Imagine going about your daily routine, except you have to watch someone else do it as you instruct them.",
      "Im going to echo everyones comments about your thinking with regards to a move to management. Management is literally a different type of job. Moving to a role where you dont write any code anymore and you manage people can make a lot of folks unhappy. I made the move consciously and have never been happier, but it was a huge change. I was lucky to have a few mentors that helped prepare me for that role. \n\nIf its just about money, Id look for another IC role. Youve seemingly got the experience on that end and its what will make you happier. There is still more growth to be had there, and its better to make the move to management with eyes wide open as to what that means. Its better than doing that for a few years and hating it and trying to find your way back and realizing your coding has gotten a bit rusty.",
      "Its very difficult to be hired externally as a manager without any managerial experience (I would say its almost impossible, honestly).\n\nAs a manager myself, I would say that the role is very rewarding and challenging, and I would recommend anybody interested to try it as long as theyre willing to make the skill investments.\n\nAs far as progressing in your career, think about progress on two axis: complexity and responsibility. Do you want to do more challenging stuff? Do you want to be responsible over more things? Both?\n\nIf you just want more challenge, I suggest remaining an IC and asking your manager for more challenging projects, explore a transfer of team, or join a new company. If you want some of the latter, you may want to explore management, especially if youre already at a high IC level such as architect, where youre already responsible for a great deal of things (architecture, onboarding, eng culture to a large degree). If you still find yourself pining to have even more or even sole responsibility then you might have topped out in this role, especially if what you want more influence over is team, product, company or business related.",
      "Management because of not being bored at the current position seems to be a bad idea mainly because managerial track requires different skills and contains different responsibility. Now what you do is mostly technical and dont interact with other people much (ofc depending on your position and company)\n\nBut managerial track would make you code less and interact with the code base less (ofc this differring widely). As a manager you would need to be responsible for the project and your team. So a lot of mentoring, understanding your peers and employees, tracking your subordinates career growth. In some places being manager would mean that you dont code anymore.\n\nSo you need to change your mindset and evaluate your skills and mindsets. Definitely not for everyone, especially when they dont like to take care of people and teams. It is better to move to another company which a higher ladder for ICs.",
      "You contradicted yourself. You say that you are totally autonomous, but management wont let you introduce new tech. You may not be as autonomous as you think. \n\nReading _The Manager's Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change_ by Camille Fournier helped me think about the switch from IC to EM, and I ultimately chose to remain an IC because I felt there was more I could learn.

The second time I changed teams within the new company to get deeper ownership and leadership experience.",

You also get to be in various styles of managements - where some would give you the freedom to select your tech and improve the dev experience.\n\nFrom my perspective, you should go into Tech Lead role which provides mix of EN and IC.

      "I have a little over 10 yoe, have been staff level at a midsize company, am at a different company where I am effectively the same.  \n\nI've been offered opportunities to switch to a purely managerial role and I've turned them down because the bulk of that job seemed like it would be worse for me.\n\nAt a high enough level I don't think the two are that different aside from a few key things.  \n\nSomething to keep in mind: higher the level as an IC the more meetings you will be in.  You don't get people to buy into an idea by just... saying it.  There is definitely politicking involved.  I am not in as much as a pure manager but it is definitely far more than zero!  I don't think you can reasonably be at this level unless you are some deep specialist without acting in some managerial capacity.\n\nYou will mentor in either gig.  I mentor 3 other folks indirectly (they will ask me for advice, etc.)  I will spend a fair bit of time coaching them.  I will help them code better by pair programming or via code reviews. Helping them structure some of their work to keep them on the rails.  The difference between myself and a manager is more around motivation.  If I can get them to do lower lever work I don't have to and can focus on higher level concerns and have broader influence.  A manager needs them to be good because they are relying on them to get things done as their rating is based on the performance of others.  Personal problems someone has don't directly effect me (I care but don't have to deal with it).  I can't hire and fire people, I can ask for resources for a task but ultimately resourcing is managerial.\n\nI am honestly not coding as much these days but can always hop in.  My work is really more around architecting systems (documentation and presentations are big here), doing tech talks to help educate our engineers, scoping work, mentoring, and convincing management to do certain slots of work.  \n\nI am effectively a manager but with softer power and different motivations.  \n\nJust something to consider as an alternative path.  I'd also note a lot of places don't get how to handle engineers like this, but I think the industry as a whole is getting a better handle on it.",

To be a good manager requires a very different skill set that I think is better aligned with those who come from a delivery/project management role due to the significantly increased amount of juggling. So in that regard, I feel its not a good way to capitalise on the skills you've built. \n\nMy current situation still has me very technical but to create a team that can work autonomously whilst still being collaborative is an entire new beast that I need to learn but there is so much product I still want to build, however finite time will not allow for both.",

      "With no experience, I'd recommend CompTIA A+ and interesting home lab projects that you add to your resume and discuss during interviews. \n\nYour main focus, in order to get a foot in the door, should be entry level/support/help desk roles; you shouldn't disregard network tech, entry level positions either. \nCCNP isn't what you should be pursuing, imo. It would be overkill, and you might really struggle going over the material without actual networking experience. CCNA is more entry level, but again probably not the best cert for the roles you should be pursuing, until you get some experience. \n\nIf you know networking is what you want to get involved in sooner or later, and since you have no IT experience at this time, I would go over the material for CompTIA Network+. You can then either take the exam, or just use what you studied to prep for Cisco CCNA. The latter dives a bit deeper into different topics, while I believe Net+ is good to get you some basic knowledge of different network devices, protocols, etc.",

      "Many feel that with no IT experience, youll need to start with entry level IT help desk work first. From what Ive read here, many folks believe that you will find it harder to get the entry level work with CCNA cause its a more advanced networking knowledge cert and its better to start with CompTIA A+ which proves you know the help desk material. Once you get your first IT job, then start to work on your CCNA if you want to go into networking or another area that values that cert.",

I don't knock the hustle of working to try and earn a cert like that but you would be in for a shock if you managed to pass it and then end up somewhere just off the back of it.\n\nI would maybe dip your toe into CCNA, also maybe the Security+.  Maybe try and get an entry level service desk job first where you are dealing with first line stuff, get to know how active directory works and managing O365 stuff.  Then you can move on to the more complex stuff where CCNA would be more relevant.\n\n  \nedit: someone mentioned CCST, forgot about this as i think its pretty new, definitely looks at this."

      "Okay if you're making a portfolio of personal projects here's my honest to god suggestion: Start an LLC with an official sounding name and \"hire\" yourself as either an intern or junior dev, or make it look like you were an intern and they liked you so much they  hired you. Backdate it a few years and BAM congratulations you now have enterprise programming experience.\n\nIf programming is something you already know about and like, don't bother with network engineering just get into something like systems programming, software engineering, or devops engineering. Or if you want to be really spicy, get your COBOL on and move into mainframe programming (you can't lie your way into this one though only legacy financial institutions use it).\n\nI got burned on a very similar job training scheme called Franklin Apprenticeships (recently changed their name to Franklin Skills now that they can't seem to get anyone job placements) that I'm now convinced only exists to siphon state & federal grant money while essentially just running you through their own version of Udemy. I later found a talent incubator in my city that did a much better job but also had way higher standards for its apprentices, maybe see if you can find a talent incubator that will give you an interview."

My advise would be to keep the role you have now, seek a more senior member of staff and see if you can shadow them.

      "What is your bachelors in?",
      "If you have 5 years left on your service obligation, I would start with COMTIA Sec+, Net+, etc. You should be able to get vouchers for those exams through the military. After knocking those out, move up to CCENT / CCNA / MCP / MCSA / Linux cert depending what you find interesting as you gain more knowledge through study. Considering the military can pay for your degree through GI Bill / Tuition Assistance, its not going to hurt to start down that path. Many programs available online and provide plenty of hands on learning. My recommendation is to start with certs first, get a good base of knowledge, and then apply to grad school as you transition out of the military. \n\nAlso consider that many National Guard programs will pay tuition and fees for State schools if you decide you want to stay in part time after your service obligation as an officer is up (opportunity to switch to a Signal Corps / Communications field here).",

      "The two aren't really comparable. If it's a good master's program, you'll cover your ccna material in the first class or two. These days, ccna is generally taught at the associates level, not the masters level. \n\nIf you do federal contracting after your enlistment is up, the degree will carry more weight. Generally speaking, certs are more valuable earlier in your career while education is more important for advancement later in your career. \n\nPersonally, I would tell you to split the difference and get a ccnp. It's basically a masters in networking with more hands-on experience. Better prospects in the job market too. ",

Sounds like you're motivated enough to self study, so if you want to still go into networking then you can do it in 5 years on the tail end of your service commitment.

No they are necessary if they want to keep their businesses afloat. Even PMs are a little more important. When the Ax swings they start looking to consolidate management. Managers are a dime a dozen. Sure you can be making a fat salary doing nothing for 5 - 10 years but when you are canned how do you prove you were a good manager ? I asked one of my recruiter friends and they told me stay near the tech and you are always safe. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would say if you want a raise and less stress work 10 years-ish as an Engineer and go into Sales Engineering etc. They are the necessary people who are the backbone of the company. They get paid well (Salary plus comission) and no outage windows or implementations. When I want to retire I think I may do that :)",

    "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nAfter working in my current company for 15 years, I'm planning a career change to IT/Networking. I don't have a IT degree, but I worked in a language lab in my former position (for 12 years) where I troubleshooted computers and worked alongside our IT department. Also, I've been building my PC for years and have troubleshooted other people's PC at work. Currently, I'm a professor at the same university.\n\nMy plan is to take CCNA early next year. I can plan to take A+. My goal is to get an entry-level job in IT/Networking and move up. Also, I'm older (50) so I know this career change will be challenging.\n\nDo you guys think my plan is doable? What other certs or experience do you all recommend I get? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",
    "comments": [
      "chances of starting at entry level in networking with no experience is slim.  Work on A+ first and build from there.",
      "Depending on the real world experiences you mentioned you had with troubleshooting computers, if you add A+ to that, you can likely get a role as an entry-level help desk tech.  Dont sell yourself short, you arent completely lacking in experience!\n\nCCNA is a good cert to see multiple different areas of networking, and if you will truly are interested in the networking field.  Once you get an entry level role, you can start to see what areas of IT you find interesting and start to focus in that direction.  Certs will help you get an interview and compliment your experience, but they cant really replace experience.  \n\nBest thing to do is just get your foot in the door and gather experience!  From there, you will see which certs you should pursue based on where your interests lie and the needs of the company.  Best wishes for your journey!",
      "Mileage may vary but I was able to obtain a jr network engineer position 3 weeks after getting my ccna. I have no networking experience and only 6 months at a call center doing iOS and macOS support. I applied to everything even network engineer positions knowing very well it would be highly unlikely Id get an interview. Well, somehow I got an interview and they offered a jr network engineer position so you never know Id say go for the ccna if networking is what you want. Ccna is the only certification I have.",
      "This course will help you get other it skills after your certifications\n\nhttps://www.udemy.com/share/106lzc3@cFHchcydTuqPnGKDiB6yNHP8NZ90QDVKi0JvdNN6gtfw1jWTsSmoi-Yk5hpqA8rg/",
      "So I'm 48 this year ,  and my various roles within other companies and my own company changes all the time,  so it's quite normal.  The \"secret\" I've discovered many many moons ago ,  and after almost 3 decades in the IT industry, is to be be like a sponge,  soak in all of the information from as many sources as you can get,  and NEVER stop learning. We are living in an age where information is available for anything you can think of,  more than ever before,  so you are not limited in what you can learn if you put your mind to it. So if you feel you need A+,  go for it!  It shouldn't take you more than a couple of weeks to get,  and then,  if you have absolutely no networking experience,  look at the free courses on Cisco Netacadamy next. They have an awesome entry level networking course on their that you can do before your ccna."

      "Ccna will be much better. But harder too. But i still would recommend ccna over a+ or network+.",
      "If you have zero background / knowledge, then A+ is where you want to start. CCNA will assume you have a good grasp of IT concepts and terms.",
      "Just start applying for T1 help desk positions now. Dont wait.\n\nAlso, CCNA and A+ arent even in the same ball park. A+ is a generic; what is this called and why would you use it. IMO, its a useless cert.\n\nCCNA actually teaches useful useable skills, but someone with 0 tech background might not fully grasp some of the concepts.",
      "If you have zero knowledge, start with A+. After that, do N+ OR CCNA. Then security+. You can begin job searching NOW, chances of landing a job increase after one cert at this entry level though. Get those 3 or 4 certs and you'll be in a good spot with a good knowledge base to continue learning whatever you want."

      "You definitely could shoot for a NOC role, which would set you up for a Net Admin/Eng role in the future. Living in the RTP area also puts you very close to Cisco, so something to keep in mind."

I have been trying to avoid Helpdesk roles as I have been in a similar job in the past and have neglected it, but if I need to bite the bullet, I will compromise and take the helpdesk role for my career goals.

Perform a password recovery in order to gain access to CLI and then perform the factory reset. Resetting process is almost never the same as we get different manufacturers from different generations, so we would have to research on Google for proper procedures. We would also type in a variety of 'show' commands to verify that it has been properly reset. If we are unsure of the process, we refer to our DL (Department Lead)\n\nI would also like to note that around once/twice a month we would have a special operation where we would decommission server racks in local datacenters and prepare them for transit to one of our facilities to process. Sometimes we would take out the actual servers, and take the individual servers, or we would just take the entire rack itself with the servers within them.\n\nThere are tons of other Network equipment that we process as well, but I don't want to make this post any long than it already is.
