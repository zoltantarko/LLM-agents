    "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI live in Germany and work with C# mainly in Unity Engine for AR/VR development. There have not been a lot of jobs in this field so far, I have struggled to bag each job I have now(2 in total)  and I am unfortunately working in this for around 3.5 years now. So I have lost touch with other programming languages I know like C++ and Python.  Thinking about my future, I am scared I will not be able to find a decent job in a few years if the VR industry does not take off.  I am not completely from a creative background so I do not know 3d modeling to have a fully wholistic profile for game development or VR development. \n\nI am thinking of either investing in learning :\n\n*  UI or UX and translating this into VR\n* 3d modelling in Blender\n\n  \nBut again, these are gambles, I think, because it depends on how the VR industry evolves. However, I am passionate about this field. I do not have a lot of interest in game development. When I worked in VR, I always worked on industry-based applications. \n\nOr:  \n\n* Computer Vision and Machine Learning using Python/C++ (have  a little background in Computer Vision, so wouldn't be starting from scratch)\n* Product Management\n* Digital Marketing\n* Web development(especially in web XR)\n\nand I do have an interest in these fields\n\nOr:\n\n* System/Network Admin\n* Embedded Systems(I have a masters in this but do not have any working experience which makes it harder to find a job)\n* C# developer\n\nI feel these three roles have a lot of jobs so I would be doing it to make my life stable rather than for interest. I still have an interest in embedded systems as I did my masters in it but it seems like I will have to again put a lot of effort into learning and getting myself back on track.\n\nI feel like I know a little of everything but no good enough in any  :/ Any help is appreciated!",

Are you mistaking career dissatisfaction for a deeper, personal issue?\n\n> \"I was a driven and ambitious person who lost all drive since I moved to my current employer around 7 years back...\"\n\nWhy did you lose your drive? Was it the job, the environment, or something else? How the hell do you expect a degree to fix that?\n\n> \"I also have a credit coming on my name soon and had a baby a few months back...\"\n\nCongratulations, but damn, that's a lot of responsibility. How will adding a master's degree, with its time and financial demands, affect your family and financial stability?\n\n> \"Pursuing a master's degree seems like an option to me...\"\n\nIt's an option, sure, but is it the right one for your situation?

      "I actually did start a masters after 10 years in the industry in Austria.  It is completely useless from a career point of view (most recruiters don't even look at it, and value experience more than that).  However, doing the degree was somewhat beneficial in that I was able to learn something without the \"sword of damocles\" of career anxiety hanging over my head.  The degree I chose was also in a \"useless\" field: Computational Social Science.  If you can envision doing something just for fun, I would say go for it.  There are many students here who happily take 6-8 semesters for the degree, since it doesnt cost much.\nHave you considered asking your manager about some growth prospects or perhaps to sponsor some courses for you?  You don't have to \"switch\" to get some fresh new perspectives"

    "content": "Long post warning. I'm in the UK and I've been a teacher for 15 years, I do a good job but it's never been what I desired for a career. I studied maths and got a 2:1 BSc back in 2005. I started an MSc in software engineering but I couldn't keep up with it due to my degree not having enough of the basic computer science grounding required plus I was young and a little stupid. Sadly I only achieved a PGCert (1/3 of an MSc). The UK were desperate for maths teachers (as always) so I decided it was a reasonable path to a guaranteed income and I could look to study some of the basics in my own time and attempt the MSc part time eventually moving out of teaching within 5-6 years.\n\nWell, obviously that didn't pan out, as \"my own time\" was a pipe dream for several years. The recession hit in 2008 stagnating my wages and locking me in a small flat with negative equity and a young family. University fees got hiked massively in 2010, and with each passing year my ability to maintain up to date knowledge in the IT world diminished. In 2013 I hit a low and left a teaching job with the intention of leaving teaching entirely due to stress and disillusionment. Fully expecting to be doomed to dead end, unskilled labour job or destroying my soul in a statistical analyst job. However I was convinced by a former coworker to give post16 teaching a try. My own still strong mathematical skills allowed me to find a bit of a niche teaching the very high end maths such as Alevel Further Maths and IB HL, and helping prep students for university entrance exams for Oxbridge.\n\nWhilst this was far more enjoyable to teach, I still wanted something different. I've always regretted dropping out of the MSc. I had tried to keep up to date and learn skills. I'm the go to guy for any IT stuff in the dept (even over the CS teachers). I taught myself python and VB and used them to create some fun interactive teaching activities.\n\nIn 2018 I took the plunge. The OU were offering loans for part time degrees in specific fields so I committed to studying a BSc part time. I didn't feel confident enough to dive straight back into an MSc after the 2006 disaster, and figured the BSc would give me enough grounding in modern tech and practices that I hadn't kept up with whilst teaching.\n\nFour the last four years I've given up most of my hobbies to pursue this, studying at a faster than recommended pace, completing 11 out of 12 modules. (I had intended to finish all 12 in 4 yrs but COVID happened earlier this year and chronic fatigue for 3 months was too much and I had to defer the final module). I have distinctions in 8, a upper pass in the ninth and I'm expecting high scores in both the modules I've completed this year. My final project module will complete in 2023 now and I intend for it to be within the ML field.\n\nBut I don't know if I can continue this for another 2/3 years after that to get the MSc whilst teaching. I'll be applying for 2023 starting jobs come the September cycles. But I'm up against younger fresh faced graduates in their early twenties. I turn 40 this year.\n\nI suppose my question is, do I have a chance of getting out of teaching and into IT after all this or have I been wasting my time and my life ( and money) for the last four years?\n\nSorry for the rant but this has been playing heavily on my mind and I needed to vent somewhere. If you've got this far, thank you for reading. If you have an opinion on my prospects, good or bad, I'd be very grateful to hear it.",

To give some context, the reason I'd like to move is to live with or near my partner whose current job contract requires him to be in the UK until the beginning of 2024.  I would also need visa sponsorship.\n\nA bit of information on my current job. I've been with the same company since I graduated university so I have about 3.5 YOE with them including my internship experience.  I work on an air traffic control program for the FAA here and so the main languages I work with are Ada and C with a little bit of C++.  As such, I've been searching for jobs within the UK that use a similar stack and to no surprise, pretty much all of them are related to some kind of civil or defense work.  How likely would it be for those kind of companies to be willing to sponsor someone from outside of the UK to work on a UK defense work contract?\n\nOf course another idea I've had is to work for company I work for now but remotely from the UK.  My company has presence in the UK and so I've been lucky enough to start a process that MAY allow me to do this remote work.  I currently have an application started within my company that requires due diligence from multiple sectors of the company to review my teleworking request.  I still have about another month left of waiting to see what these results are.\n\nI know that if I were to leave my current job for one in the UK that I would most likely experience a significant pay cut but I'm willing to deal with that in the future.  There's a part of me that would love to get a UK based job (I know that will not be easy of course) to experience the actual work environment there because while I do love the people I work with now, the work/life balance I deal with now is something I'm not sure I'd like to have for the rest of my career.  Is it too naive to think it'll be any different in the UK?  I'm also now a bit worried that my current tech stack just may not be good enough for a lot of positions I see in LinkedIn that seem to really want front-end or more modern language experienced people. \n\nI'm sorry for the long spiel and I hope I've reached the correct forum for these questions.

My father in an IT lifer and have several good friends in the IT field. I myself am an industry biologist. While I absolutely love science and am passionate about my work, some toxic work environments I have found myself in have pushed me to go in a different direction.  IT has always one of those things I think I could be really happy doing. I have always had a knack for understanding computers and how to troubleshoot them, I have never ventured beyond the hobbyist sort of computer nerd. I have always wanted to step up my credentials in my desired path and become a professional.\n\nEach time I try, my IT buddies are always a bit pessimistic. Before now, say about 10 years ago, the reaction was \"You will not make a lot of money starting out in IT\" and various other arguments about starting IT from the bottom. BTW, the money in biology isn't great either. But if your a science nerd like me, biological lab and field work can be rewarding. \n\nSo now, at 40, and again in a toxic environment and industry job, I am looking to make an exit and find another passion to pursue professionally. Now, my friends say that I have no chance to beat out a recent college grad with no experience for a job. The idea is that put a recent college grad with little to no xp vs a motivated 40 year old with little to no xp, HR will always go with the college grad, hands down. So it seems they are telling me that I missed the boat and stick to biology.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Would it be a waste of time to seek out some certifications and head for the nearest help desk wanted ad?\n\nEdit: Some great advice and feeling the reddit love. But want to clear up one topic. I know the money won't be anywhere near what I make now. I have an established career and some serious credentials backing up my experience currently. I am not looking for a change to make the money. I want the change to reinvigorate me. I want a job that I can learn and growth with in something new and exciting (for me). I also know that toxic work environments are everywhere.

I also have a wife and 3 kids, one of them being just 3 weeks old. \n\nThe point of that is...fuck your friends. \n\nGo for it. \n\nIf I can do it then so can you.",
      "Why do you care what your friends think? If they're not ambitious, that's their problem. You can make plenty of money as a 40 year old just starting in IT. Go for it.",
      "You have a STEM degree, you have a good story to tell, you (presumably) have a work ethic that will enable you to be successful.  Go for it.",
      "Dude what? You clearly don't like your current job much, what do you have to lose? Just do it. Also, your pay will scale very quickly with some experience.",
      "Ill play devils advocate here. I think your friends have some valid but misdirected points.\n\n1. While its not like this everywhere, there is absolutely toxic work environments/cultures in IT. Especially when I first stared in IT I had a few jobs that were based off of favoritism, there was a lot of gatekeeping by upper management, they expected us to do unpaid on-call, work holidays, stay late, etc. \n\nNot all companies are like that. Id wager most arent, but they do exist and you probably wont know until your already in it. It tends to happen in more jr roles but can happen nonetheless. Read about burnout at FAANG companies as well.\n\n2. You could leverage your experience in some ways to go into IT, but without any verifiable skills/background you could be taking a cut from where your at pay and title wise. Not always the case, but its a possibility.\n\n3. There are parts of IT that are boring. If you like doing field work, you may not like sitting in an office doing routine work.\n\n4. Understand IT, especially in the entry level area, is very oversaturated and competitive right now. Thats not to say there is no chance to break in, but there is a industry around funneling people into IT and there has been a drastic spike of people trying to get into the field especially since Covid started. Look at r/Comptia, this sub, and some other IT related subs growth over the past few years and youll see. The downside is employers see this. Youll be competing with people half your age and x2 your level of experience which can be frustrating. Being older though, you can bring a unique perspective to things. It can just take time to get in the door.\n\n5. Adding a bit to points 1 & 2. The pay can be a let down in those entry level roles. Your best bet is to get some experience then job hop to get a better salary. With that said, you could easily be in a position where you have to take a drastic pay cut just to get experience and depending on things outside of work (family, kids, living situation) this can be a downside. Very few come right into the industry and get 6 figure salaries. The majority have to climb there way up to that despite what YouTubers and tech articles will make you think.\n\nIm not saying that IT is a bad route. You can and should look at it, but be aware of what was mentioned above. Id say maybe get some certifications while you continue to work and see if you really like it. There is a huge difference between being a computer nerd and the workings of an enterprise environment. Certs can give you a brief taste of what youll be doing and what to learn.\n\nWhatever you do, best of luck! IT can be very rewarding, but I try not to see it with rose colored glasses. There are plenty of 40 year olds that switch and do okay, you can too if you put in the work. I may be biased but I think you should give it a try if youre really passionate about it. I wish you nothing but success!",
      "Sounds like you should make the move, but you left out some key information.  A career change will likely result in a salary reduction.  Entry level help desk gigs don't pay that much typically (depending on location).  Will you be able to make ends meet if your salary gets significantly reduced (at least for the first couple of years)?",
      "I think the biggest challenge is going to be convincing HR or a hiring manager that you're really looking for a career change and aren't expecting big bucks. \n\nMore often than not -- and regardless of the candidate's age -- when I've taken a chance on interviewing someone for an entry-level IT position, we hit a \"But that's less than I make now\" stumbling block that's discouraging for everyone.\n\n(Incidentally, I'm very up front about what different roles pay, but that rarely stops people from thinking that the top of the range is the floor for negotiation.)",
      "Have you considered merging your experience in Industrial Biology and Technology?

I've been told by a good friend of mine that I don't have a moral fortitude to make it to a university, much less to finish it. He is right.\n\nBut I don't care. I want this. I already made certain steps towards reaching that goal. Moved to a city where there is such an university. Found a job and am renting an apartment. It is a city I wanted to live in. I didn't know whether I would make it this far. I believed in the Lord that He would provide as He wishes, and today, here I am. I won't back down simply because the task seems impossible given the lack of my character and whatnot. I'll fight for it. \n\nThe point of the story, just as it was mentioned: if you really want to change your career, your life, for the better, don't listen to those who would discourage you from doing it.

In fact, I'm curious as to why ALL of them (?) are telling you not to do it. What's left unsaid by all of them? Do they know you pretty well?

From what I've noticed, IT professionals work behind the scenes and non-IT staff don't understand or consider the challenges that IT professionals experience so we end up having to learn conflict resolution when dealing with other people, because essentially they are all having a problem if they are asking for help. People get frustrated when things don't work correctly and often times IT professionals take the brunt of that.\n\nBut if you really want to make the switch because its time for a change, then absolutely go for it.

I mean I binged and watched it like a Netflix series. Once I felt confident, I then posted on the Nextdoor app throughout my local neighborhood Offering free IT services. I knew I was onto something big. Within minutes I had 50+ requests for various IT-related tasks. I went to Freshdesk and built out a domain so anytime I would get an email - a ticket would automatically be created and I could streamline it to the customer.

Don't get comfortable. You're there to learn on the job while continuing your education for about a year or two. If you don't have it then the A+ cert is a good place to start. The cert will give you more weight during the application process, it also tells employers that you understands the fundamentals of how a computer works and how to troubleshoot issues. If you're set on getting into networking then you can get your Network + cert and then the CCNA cert.

      "I'm 48, started studying May 25, 2021 CompTIA A+ (Core 1 and Core 2). I did online studies every night for about an hour and a half and listen to podcasts in between driving to work and home.  Took Core 1 (twice) passed on my second try in October 2021. Passed Core 2 and got my A+ certification February 2022.  Now, I'm about to start my entry level job at Amazon as an IT Support Associate II. I went full circle in a way.\n\nI belong to the hotel service industry field for 25 years. My IT experience in the business is good enough for me to be categorized as \"my IT experience\" where 25% of daily operations I deal with IT related issues.  I realized the demands of the job working as a Hotel General Manager moving-on will be too much for me (the stress oh my!), as the job itself is going from bad to worst. So I decided to get into IT and I am fortunate to be given a job offer by Amazon.  It is an entry level position, but I am confident and motivated that in about 1-2 years IT experience and the more certs achieved I'll be able to move up and level-up. \n\nDon't listen to your friends.  You'll do just fine.  Good Luck.",
      "I think you should chance it. Build the life you want. I started selling real estate in 2015, prior to that I was a wanna-be because of all sorts of reasons. Plainly I just didn't have the cajones. Everyone told me, \"No, don't do it,\" and I also had my own fear of failure. So I started part-time. All I cared about was to cover my costs, and making money was a bonus! \n\nNow, I make enought to cover costs AND go on trips AND put away a few bucks for a rainy day. In hindsight it was the best decision. I still have the day job, but it is just a job. Yes it provides PTO, insurance, and all those other benefits, but it still is just a job. When my peers get negative around me I tell them about real estate. Lol, kills the coversation every time. \n\nAnother childhood dream was to be an IT guy too. In 2019 I started down that rabbit hole too. It has been slower because I didn't stay forcused and I like plinking on tryhackme and watching Network Chuck and Health Adams. In February I got my Net+, and working on my Sec+ now. \n\nMy goal is to combine my sales skills with IT as a sales engineer - that is my sweet spot imo. Who knows if I will get there, as I am 51 now, but I am having so much fun all combined (day job which is just a day job, selling real estate, and talking geekdom). Good luck.",

People calling about their problems. Network Admin? people on your network calling about their problems. Cyber Security? People calling about problems you made and now you have to fix them. Developers? Executives giving you more problems.\n\nDon't get me wrong though. I'm a problem solving type of guy and I don't mind it. But again, most people with a problem are not having a good day. IT can get toxic, really fast.\n\nIf you decide to go with it, get some certs and do it while keeping your current job. Build a home lab to get familiar with things.

You will go further faster given you have understanding of the field and how to best support their objectives from an IT perspective.  When I used to run a small team of field service techs for researchers, I would have loved to have someone with your background, even perhaps being 15 years older than other starters.\n\nAnother gambit is if you know if your current workplace orders software/hardware from certain IT vendors.  They sometimes are interested in taking on entry level IT sales roles to people who know how the org operates and what the business needs are vs. some 20 year IT guy who knows more Cisco commands than how to get a researcher to buy products.\n\nOverall I just think its good to find value/use in your current experience, even if you are moving to IT, instead of just starting from scratch.",

For sure, no way around that. Especially at your age. 40 is still young, but it doesn't matter what the crowd says lol. What does your body tell you when you get up in the morning and your bones are literally talking out loud to you. Sounding like a bowl of rice crispies just walking to the bathroom lol.\n\nIn your 20's, all-nighters and studying for 18+ hours a day wasn't a big deal. But try doing that NOW. I'm only 32, and if I miss just an hour of sleep I'm basically a zombie the next day. I know everybody wants to sound tough and say it's not that hard but lets be real here. Then on top of all that you have to account for family time and other life responsibilities. \n\nYES - There is a lot of money in IT IF you're willing to put in that kind of work, and not give up.\n\nYES - it can be rewarding if you like tech (only in certain fields though).\n\nYES - IT jobs can be pretty secure depending on what you pursue. \n\nBut again it really comes down to what you're capable, and willing to do in order to get there. \n\nThe only times I'd actively discourage it is if: \n\n1: You're not a driven person, you'll get nowhere in IT as it's heavily driven by the workers work ethics. If you're lazy, you're not gonna go anywhere unless you know someone. Tech isn't really something you can \"fall\" into. You have to search it out, make yourself competitive, and apply yourself on some level. \n\n2: If you're not wiling to learn with the evolving industry. Tech is one of the most evolving fields in the world, what you learn today has a chance to be completely irrelevant tomorrow. So if you want one of those \"sit in my chair and watch YouTube all day\" kind of jobs, either become a network engineer, or stay away. Even low end entry level Help Desk jobs do more work then that and deal with evolving tech.\n\n\\--------------------------\n\nTLDR; \n\nIf you're doing it for personal reasons, then go for it!

      "You can change, and its your life, do what you want.  However changing careers at 40 can and will be difficult because you have to learn a whole bunch of info that may not be applicable everyday.\n\nMoney will come back and if you can tolerate the temporary financial set back, then youll be fine.",
      "Unless you got solid skills already just know youre starting from the bottom rungs of the ladder - which dont pay well and can be pretty hellish. \n\nGet some certs before diving in. \n\nAge doesnt mean jack in IT - competency does.",
      "I mean they're right about the money starting out, help desk isn't great pay. Tbh though, I'm 6 months in and enjoying it a lot more than I thought.\n\nThere's upsides and downsides, and like every industry, everyone in it likes to talk shit about it lol. Don't think it'll be the answer to all your problems, but you can definitely do it if you want. There's some ageism, but it's kinda reversed if you want to get in the management side lol\n\nIn short: entry level pay bad, but entry level job is definitely attainable at your age, do what you wanna do",
      "Money isn't the problem, the problem people have in IT is they have no passion for it. If money is the main goal of a career then you'll be miserable. That should never be the focus. Entry level IT jobs are decent around like 40 - 60k. Past that it can go up to 100k in some jobs, there are also a minority of jobs in IT that make at least 150k. But again, money should never be the goal at all. You can make a lot but end up hating the job. If you have no passion for IT and just want to do it cause every fucking person is doing IT (pun intended) then don't enter the field. This field is saturated because everyone is greedy and just wants to earn a lot of money and not learn shit in the field then they'll eventually fail and whine and complain that IT is bad. Its a field not for everyone. You have to have a desire to learn and keep learning till the day you retire. If you don't have that ability then don't enter the field because this is a field that is constantly evolving and growing till the end of this universe. Take several IT courses and learn stuff.\n\n If it doesn't interest you and something that bores you then forget IT you won't thrive in the field. Plan ahead, don't plan while you're doing something in IT. I think more than half of the people in IT are miserable and failing at their jobs because they have no interest in the field and are disappointed they aren't becoming a millionaire or something. This field is also a field that weeds people out very easily. If you don't know your shit and don't prepare enough, you won't get anywhere. If you have the dedication, passion and interest for IT then you'll be fine, if not then don't bother.",
      "If you are good at it could be rewarding, otherwise you're gonna be setting up computers for chump change. You know yourself better than reddit so what do you think?",
      "How important is a degree? Is there ever a point where experience trumps a degree?",
      "Your friend is speaking in absolutes that are not absolutely true. Yes its possible you could hit some speed bumps but it doesnt have to mean theres no hope. 2 of my last 3 hires were older than me at 40, 1 of them having left a different career and knowing he would take a pay cut. Oh and he has since gotten his sec+ and promoted into a junior cyber analyst role. \n\nThat guys experience? A little equivalent to geek squad 20 years prior and he a new online degree focused on database while working his other job.",
      "Wowsie, I guess the grass is always greener. I'd love a science job!!\n\nIT, IMO, feels kinda dead end to be honest - I always feel that I yearn for more, i'd love to be in something bigger. In my experience IT is obviously service based, the hidden backbone that's taken for granted until it fails.. It does sometimes just feel like groundhog day \"same shit, different day\", not actually creating something. Obviously this is all my experience, take with a pinch of salt, still valid nonetheless, regardless of what anyone says - We all have our own experience and opinions on working in this field.\n\nIt has its moments where you do a great job and remember why you chose IT, as some wizard...",
      "What do your friends know about what you have achieved and what knowledge you have?  Just go for it and give it a shot. With your science background, you will do fine.",
      "I think this is a perfect opportunity to prove your friends wrong. If your really passionate about this I say go for it and try your best. \n\nIf your passionate enough, you will surpass them in no time.",
      "All of my IT friends have said go for it! Most of my online 'research says go for it. Just on reddit there are so many stories about savvy folks changing from a totally non-IT field and getting in the mix at noob positions or pivoting from the experience they have.\n\n\nI am on my 2nd short term help desk gig this year after selling cell phones for years. I started studying for Network+ last fall but I haven't gotten any cert so I tell interviewers I'm a noob but my studying let's me not sound like a poser, just a novice. I positioned my customer contact and previous call center time to get my foot in the door. I'm 55.",
      "Youre never too old to make a career switch. If you want to do it and you think it will bring a lot of positive change in your life then do it. \n\nBut I will say, if you feel like you are in a toxic work environment. Then apply for other positions in your field first! It may be possible that you find a fulfilling job with great coworkers, AND good pay within your field. A career change is a big step so definitely think it through. \n\nBest of luck.",
      "Yes you should switch to IT.  Long ago honestly.  Yes you should follow your passion and get in IT.  Even at 40yrs old you can grow exponentially.  If the world of IT is a hotel - IT people are on different floors such is there perspective shaped relative to the floor they are on.  Take a few classes and get a cert.  start off doing contracting work since youre not too concerned about the money.  The fastest way to grow is contract work W2 or 1099.  Turn that fear into your power and get out there.  Start living."

I am now a mother and ideally I want to still be able to earn money while taking care of my daughter at home (the dream). \n\nAs someone who have never worked in IT industry I imagine that it's possible with IT jobs.\nBUT I know the reality is often far from what you imagine, so I want to ask out here.\n\nThe question:\n1. Is it possible to have a remote IT job without a degree and/or with a late start?\n\n2. If you are one of them, what career do you have and how do you achieve it?\n\n3.

      "I started in IT when I was 25 working for a printing company's help desk. I was at 32k to start.\n\nWas promoted a year and a half later to an Analyst doing setups for them at 33.5k.\n\nLeft that job after a year and went to work an entry level helpdesk role at a MSP for 35k.\n\nMoved up over the next 4.5 years to 70k. Was doing a mix of remote and on-site support for a helpdesk and as an engineer.\n\nJust accepted an offer for 100k on a fully remote role doing Windows product support.\n\nI don't have a degree and only had my CompTIA trifecta(A+, Network+,and Security+).\n\nI just took everything that I could learn and wasn't scared to take new things. \n\nIf you have technical aptitude and the desire to learn, you will go far with the right company. \n\nHope this helps!",
      "1. Yes, it is possible.\n\n2. I work as a cloud engineer for a CSP (cloud service provider). I started out working in-person, and then the job transitioned to a fully remote role during the pandemic. I am now 100% remote. I started working as a help desk technician (though my work was more akin to remote desktop support) at 26, with no certifications or prior experience in IT. (I studied for the A+ and went through most of the Google IT Support professional certification prior to my interview, but I did not have these certifications when I got the job.) Ive since been promoted multiple times and have escaped the dreaded phone/chat queues.\n\n3. I work 40 hours per week, Monday through Friday. I have occasional on-call work (one week every 3-4 months).\n\nI agree with one of the other commenters that working remote full-time in IT will be difficult to do if youre also trying to juggle childcare at the same time. Although you would be working from home, you would still be working a full-time job. There is no way to perform both roles well simultaneously. Your work will suffer, and you wont be able to give full-attention to your child.\n\nYou would be half-assing both roles.\n\nI dont think IT is the career youre looking for if youre hoping to find a remote job that you can juggle with caring for your daughter. Something else in tech, like a freelance dev job (where you set your own hours and/or work a contract for a finished product vs. working on a team with set full-time hours) might allow you to work a more flexible schedule. It would be very hard to break in to that kind of job without any experience though. \n\nGood luck with finding a job that allows you to live the dream.",
      "It is definitely doable but it will be difficult. 29 years old really isnt that late to the game, its more the issue of trying to break into the industry in a full remote capacity without any degree or relevant experience. \n\nTo succeed what I would recommend is skippping the generic IT route (systems administrator style positions) and trying to get straight into a specialized junior position like DevOps or Security. \n\nI would start with some AWS certifications. Study and learn and see if it interests you. Certs are a great way to get something on your resume when you have no experience or degree. They absolutely will not guarantee you a job but they can definitely help and theyre a great learning opportunity.",
      "Started my IT career at 59 after a 40 career in the restaurant business.  Took a certificate program at My Computer Career and landed a tier 1 position with the FDA.  Work from home, great benefits and a security clearance!  You can do it",
      "Honest Question - Do you like IT, and do you consider yourself technically savvy in your personal life ?  If not, I wouldn't pursue it.  The good thing about IT is that you can jump into it at any age if you start and keep up with training because it changes so fast.  The bad thing about IT is that it changes fast and requires a lot of upkeep.\n\nThe key to working from home is finding the right culture.  There are other positions directly and indirectly with IT that can support working from home \\*IF\\* the company culture allows it.\n\nProject Management / Business Analyst - These roles work from home as they mostly involve meeting with people to understand and get updates.  (PM Role could be tricky, but if it's an IT based PM Role, working from home is doable)\n\nCorporate Procurement  / Supply Chain - Again, easy to work from home, somewhat lower barrier to entry if making a carrier change.  Again, can be focused on IT if you want as well.  My organization has IT Procurement people within the larger procurement org because IT procurement can be complicated especially when it comes to licensing.\n\nThe key to the above, in my opinion, is finding a large, preferably multi-national, organization that has figured out work from home during covid so you're not pressured to come back because of lack of bodies in the building.  (Smaller companies)",
      "I think you will find that most if not all jobs start on-site before allowing remote. Even more so if you have no IT Background nor degree, nor certificates (which would be a good thing to have before starting IT; at least some basic cert).\n\nI think you have the same or better chances working remote for an architecture office, than IT without any background or experience, honestly.",
      "Yesssss!!\n\nI am 34 and while I was on unemployment from covid (formerly in the events industry, so those all shut down last year) I passed the 2 tests it takes to get the CompTIA A+ certification, one of the best foundational certificates you can get.\n\nI am now about 6 months into my first IT help desk job. I work in southern California, was offered a $50,000/yr salary. I have no former IT experience and no college degree.\n\nIt's 9:32am and I'm working from my bed right now.\n\nI'm not fully remote, but my boss said as long as there isn't stuff to do in the office physically, I can work from home whenever I want.\n\nWeekends and holidays off is something I've never experienced before... it's amazing to have a weekly routine as I am about to be 35 years old next week.\n\nFeel free to ask me anything! Honestly it was the best decision I ever made and I wouldn't say it was a difficult thing to do at all. Definitely check out r/CompTIA",
      "You totally can, most people start on the help desk or come with a heavily defined skillset backed up by certs/a defined github project page. It depends how quickly you need a job and how much foolishness you can tolerate (you'll probably start on a helpdesk).  Certs will help you climb your way up the ladder, as would being able to code (but you have to reinforce whatever you learn, daily preferably). Unless you want to work for the government College isn't a giant help to actually getting a job in IT. (Current CCIE, CISSP, Lead Security Engineer, worked for large Dow and S&P firms and small/medium firms as well)",

      "Never tell any employer that you want to take care of your daughter while working. That means you want to work, but you also have a bigger priority 100% of the time. \n\nPersonally I don't advise don't this at all. Your job might not even let you, and if you get caught trying to care for a child during your work day you could be fired. \n\nAs a mother I'm sure you already know this but childcare is a full time job.",
      "I'm a dev and work remote full time. Different work, obviously.\n\nHowever, since I got the remote job, it's become abundantly clear to me that there really isn't any way you can work from home and take care of your daughter. One of your responsibilities is going to suffer.\n\nI can tolerate the occasional interruption to answer the door, or take a personal phone call, but anymore than that and my productivity hits the floor.\n\nThis applies to the whole \"digital nomad\" lifestyle as well. Sure, I can go to Bali and work, but now I'm in paradise, stuck staring at a laptop screen, indoors, for 8 hours of the day. I'm also on a different time zone than the rest of my team so I'd be getting up at 2am for meetings.\n\nIf your job is to write news articles or some other social media type job(traditional nomad jobs), then I imagine you can make it work. For it/dev jobs that require critical thought, focus, a comfortable workstation etc, it's just not feasible\n\nIt's not just the time off task either, it's the time it takes to get back on task.\n\nIf you're not disciplined enough or not able to work undistracted, working from home will be detremental to your career and ruin remote work for the rest of us.\n\nTons of remote people aren't half as productive as they think they are because they are constantly interrupted.",
      "I have a degree in IT related field, but I want to chip in still.  \n\n\nNone of my job interviews even mentioned my studies or what I actually learned there. So this is not important at all. All employers cared about is what am I doing now and what do I know. This, in first interview can be tested by asking simple related questions to the job, and of course on second interview it's tested by some sort of assignment. So this is what determines if you get a job or not.  \n\n\nI was working full time at the office, but as pandemic hit, March 2020, our company went remote, and still haven't returned.   \nhowever, I recently had some talks, because I am switching jobs. Most of them now offer fully remote or semi-remote roles, with 1/2 days in the office if you are needed.   \nNow I got an offer from company with ability to work fully remote. They have office which is quite far for me and not feasible to commute. So this was quite big point in my talking to company.  \n\n\nI seen some HR on YouTube mentioning that you should not ask this question on the interview, but you most definitely should do and set your lines. If company doesn't want you because you want to work remote, do you really want to join that company?  \n\n\nAbout working hours, my country is 40h/week 8-17, with 1h lunch (some companies have less restrictive guidelines as the one I work now is 8-17 / 9-18 etc., as long as you do the work)   \nBut if you plan to be unavailable in certain times, I think it's worth mentioning too, and talk it out with employer, but this is not that important in my eyes, as you can do your job more flexible and in other hours.",
      "I started at 28, no degree. Just signed up to a company that helps you move into IT.

I start at 9 and finish at 5:30\n\nYou should do it if you like computers, but it is a lot of work!",

Pick up a programming language. Get good at it. That'll be the fastest and most effective route. You can pivot programming skills into A LOT of fields. A javascript or PHP developer can earn some good money and work remotely. The downside is being a developer requires focus and being in an environment where you can think without being disturbed. You will need to juggle paying attention to your daughter and committing large chunks of time to being away from her and focusing on other things.\n\nIf there is one thing I wish I knew what to do before getting start is get some programming chops. It goes a LONG ways.",
      "Yes, it is very possible. I started in my late twenties in service desk with having just the A+ cert, and have since moved to infrastructure. I work 37.5h/week (UK based). \n\nI think you might find it a little difficult to find entry level jobs that are fully remote. Depending on the company, Support roles tend to be quite hands on and user facing. They were indeed considered key workers in my office during the lockdown.",

I jumped around jobs from debt collection to health insurance, etc.  When I was around 28-29 I decided to get into the IT industry and found a job on a help desk.\n\n2.  From there I learned as much as I could and studied on my own time as well.  Getting relevant certain to whatever path you want to take would be wise.  I am now a business systems analyst and administrator for our ITSM. \n\n3.  I get paid for 40 hours a week but I honestly only work about 5-10 hours a week on average.  I get paid in the 80k range full remote.  \n\nI admit I got lucky to a certain extent, but the hardest part was initially just getting my foot in the door at a starting pay range I could live with.  \n\nGood luck, hope this helped!",

I applied for over 76 jobs, and netted one interview which got one of my life goals down, getting out of retail. \n\nMy advice would be to pursue the Comp TIA A+ Certification. You'd be ahead of the bunch to be netted an interview, and if you have transferrable skills, apply that too!\n\n40 hours a week, 10-7.

      "I've had three remote jobs during schooling - have been going to school since 2017 and will finish Spring 2022. \n\nCerts and going to school will make it easier to get into the industry.\n\nIf you do end up going to school I would highly suggest getting internships for what you want to specialize in. That will allow you to skip helpdesk and tier 2 roles and go straight into devops/network engineering/security/Linux or whatever you like that pays well. If you took general credits during your time studying architecture they will most likely transfer to other schools. That could save you months of schooling and thousands of dollars so check that out.\n\nAlso 29 is not old to get into IT so you're fine there.

Can share more privately.\n\nBuuuuuuut I want to make one thing clear... you're not going to be able to take care of a young child while still being good at your job. If you got started early and your kid is generally self sufficient (like 10+) sure, that can work.

Before that it was military and that wasn't the most relevant experience it turns out, but I had the right personality and the smarts to learn what I needed to.   \n\n\nMaybe you can find a company that will hire you on premises and train you up then let you go remote like I lucked out with.

      "I agree with the other posts, totally doable. However, your point about taking care of your daughter at the same time is the only thing that concerns me. Most IT jobs are support roles, especially in the beginning. Youll be on remote sessions and the phone a lot, in meetings etc. taking care of a little one and working from home full time would be very difficult if not impossible. \n\nI had to take care of my little at home when school went remote. Im a Sr engineer so not much end user support, more meetings and projects etc. even then it was insanely tough trying to tend to them and work. I had to work flex hours and cut down to part time. \n\nNot saying you cant do it, just saying think about the logistics before you make the jump.",
      "1. Absolutely, the majority of remote workers in our company don't have a degree.\n2.

It depends, we have very flexible work hours, one day I can work 4 hours, the next day 2 hours and the next 10 hours. \n\nBest of luck :)",
      "It is possible, but can be more challenging getting pass HR. For me I was in the middle of going to school and was currently taking courses for certifications so that helped me land my first IT position. However imo I think having a homelab can help land you a job 1000%. It tells the employer that you enjoy the field.\n\nA good strategy is to setup a homelab and use the applications the job is requiring. That way you could at least tell them that you're familiar with the applications.",

I have no history of working in IT and I studied business and law, oh and I'm 27M.   \n\n\nIs it possible to have a remote IT job without a degree and/or with a late start?\n\n  \\-I'm gonna say yes, its possible. If you haven't yet, try pick up some certifications. I did the CompTIA A+ and Network+. However, the CCNA is also a good one to start.   \nIf you are one of them, what career do you have and how do you achieve it?\n\n \\-The job I'm interviewing for is 'customer engineer' which is basically a 'product expert' with a bit of technical support thrown in.   \nHow many hours do you work / week? And what is your day like?\n\n \\-I haven't started yet but based on what I was told in the previous interview it will be 40+ hours a week with odd hours as most of the clients are American (7-11 hour time difference).",

      ">Does anyone have a remote IT job without a degree and/or with a late start (e.g. career change)?\n\nMany do.  E.g. since COVID-19 my job is thus far been almost entirely remote ... only been to the office two times over that entire period ... that might change, ... but thus far for most in tents and purposes it's \"remote only\" ... though that may change ... and some of my peers have gone officially and totally remote only - notably moving so far away that remote only is required.\n\nI also know someone who, in their 50s, a B.S. degree and in a hard science from decades earlier, but not at all IT/Engineering/Computer/Information related - they switched careers - also from something not at all IT - and are now 100% remote, and are in fact in the process of moving where they'll have to be 100% remote only.\n\n>best option if I want to work remotely\n\nMaybe ... maybe not.  Communication costs are cheap.  Consequently there's potentially always risk of who will do it for the cheapest anywhere on the planet.  But legal and other considerations may often limit that ... at least somewhat - but not entirely ... and even within a single country that might matter, as cost of living and compensation may vary greatly within a single country.  Will employer pay same regardless of employee's location ... or not at all.  Practices vary a lot by employer.  It may be a few years before that mostly settles out and we see what becomes \"the norm\".  I think in the meantime a lot of employers - and employees - are still figuring it out and \"experimenting\" with it.  Time will tell.  Likewise with the remote/not/mix ... who knows how that settles out, and may vary a lot by employer, position, nature of work, etc. ... and maybe even down to individual employees - who works better more efficiently remote vs. not ... or even based on what their tasks of the day may be.\n\n>earn money while taking care of my daughter at home\n\nWell, work is work - don't expect you'll necessarily be taking care of your daughter *and* working at the same time ... but in a lot of cases remote work may offer more flexibility on timing and such, and might be able to more-or-less keep an eye on your daughter, take breaks with her ... lunch ... way shorter commutes, etc.  But you probably won't be full time watching her *and* working *at the same time*.\n\n>BUT I know the reality is often far from what you imagine\n\nYeah, thoroughly research it before you dive in.  Many just think naive stuff like, \"Oooh, bit 'o training with some certs or code camp or whatever, maybe few months to half a year's experience ... easy 6 figure or more, just sit by computer, look at screen, type some stuff in once in a while - count me in!\".  And many will be highly disappointed that it ain't that easy.  The body of knowledge one will need to know and master to get compensation in/around that range is quite non-trivial - can easily be compared to getting a strong B.S. degree from a good school in a solid IT program.  'Bout the damn fastest I've ever seen someone make such a change took them about 1 to 1.5 years of vigorous solid full-time self-study to break into IT - going without job that whole time so they could focus on learning the skills they needed to learn to get into IT ... and then from there took 'em about 1.5 years to be solidly into 6 figure range ... but this was not your typical individual, this was someone not only highly motivated, but damn smart and fast on the uptake.  So ... that person would probably be about your top 2% or higher of typical career change folks jumping into IT.  Most take more like about 4 to 6 or more years on average to do what that person did in around 3.  And many will never make it.  Many will get into entry level positions in IT that are close to minimum wage ... and 4 ... 5 ... 6 or more years later, they'll be griping her on r/ITCareerQuestions about how they can't get ahead and are still where they started ... not everyone is up for the challenges.\n\n>Is it possible to have a remote IT job without a degree and/or with a late start?\n\nAbsolutely.  E.g. see example cited further above ... and implied caveats.\n\n>If you are one of them, what career do you have and how do you achieve it?\n\nThere's example person I cited above.  Their position is approximately - functional description - DevOps / Linux sysadmin / \"Engineer\\*\".\n\nThere's also myself ... career, I think I'd describe it as DevOps / Linux sysadmin - how I achieved it - much longer path ... basically had fair bit of electronics/engineering background ... but no degree.  After a while got my foot in the door with IT.  Always continued to *also* learn a lot on my own.  So, between my own stuff, and work experience, over time progressed to role that was primarily UNIX sysadmin, and continued to grow and progress from there ... Linux, DevOps, etc. - with lots of relevant skills along the way, e.g. out-program and out-automate most of my typical peers - but definitely not all of all of the time on everything.  Also, most of the time I've got much deeper and more thorough knowledge of Linux and most networking matters than most of my peers most of the time - again not all of them on everything all of the time.  So, anyway, I'm well able to use and leverage those skills - and they're quite valuable to my employers ... and I continue to grow and develop my skills.  It's not like you just learn it and you're done.\n\n>How many hours do you work / week? And what is your day like?\n\nBasically full time - hours usually approximately reasonably close to 40 ... as a general rule I try to keep it fairly sane - like under 45 hrs./wk. - it's not like you can get that time back later - life and other stuff continues to move right along - with or without you.  I've sometimes worked weeks in excess of 100 hours ... but those were rather extreme and mostly pretty short-term exceptions.  Have had some jobs that got too out-of-hand-too regularly.  One such job, they wouldn't back down - I gave notice and left ... and in that case rather than the customary 2 weeks notice, I gave 'em 80 working hours notice - seemed most highly fitting and appropriate under the circumstances.\n\nAlso, most IT positions will involve some on-call.  Depending mostly upon and employer and mangers and such, that can be quite reasonable and not at all too burdensome.  Or it can be totally out-of-control time to find another job.  I've turned down at least one job that had on-call requirements that were pretty much nuts - oncall half of all time, with a 10 minute leash - f\\*ck that - not living my life like that.\n\nDay like ... well, alas, this got too long, so ... splitting it ... remainder will be in [my reply comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/pfr85q/does_anyone_have_a_remote_it_job_without_a_degree/hb751k3/) to this.\n\nEdit - and edited to link the reply comment",

      "Not entirely sure it is what you're looking for but I got my start in IT before I finished my degree.

And what is your day like?\n\nOof, extremely varied. I'd say it is usually pretty chill if I need to go to an appointment I go, if I want to get lunch I go, etc. however if shit hits the fan I've had points where I was working pretty much 24 hours per day for quite a few days in a row with sleep breaks. Not sure how this schedule would work with kids being in the picture if that is what you're asking. Also you will almost certainly be expected to be on-call unless you're working in a LCOL country that doesn't allow it and get your work via an MSP.",
      "How is your English? Please dont take this the wrong way trying to give you an honest answer. If its not 110% clear you are going to have a difficult time finding anything in remote support, Ive seen native English speakers turned away from over the phone jobs like remote IT support just because they had a thick accent and they were pretty desperate for help. These remote IT support jobs are all basically customer service over the phone so its imperative that you are easily understandable to frustrated people. Sadly because so many jobs like this are outsourced companies in the US want people with clear US accents so not to be misconstrued for an overseas support line. \n\nNow as for starting your IT career go get the A+ to show that you know something about computers, that is all I had with my first job and its really not hard especially if you user Professor Messors free videos.\n\nGood luck to you!",

    "content": "Hello, \nI've been seeing alot of youtube videos of layoffs in the tech field, and how hard it is for these people with years of experience to find a job. I'm worried that I made the wrong choice. I've been working in the kitchen for 10+ years, and during the pandemic I realized that I needed to find a more stable career. I've been in school as a computer information systems major/ minor statistics  because I initially wanted to pursue a field related to data. I've never even heard of data science befofe 2020 lol. But I found about cybersecurity, and from all the youtubers/dept of labor statistics, it seemed like this is a field that will grow tremendously and would be a stable career choice.It also seemed more accessible to older 2nd career adults. I took some elective classes for cybersecurity(networking/ aws) and I've been studying to get certifications. But now Im just seeing way too many people getting laid off and unable to get back in. I just don't want to waste my time.. im about to hit my mid 30s and I don't want to invest all this time and money to later be unemployed and still in the kitchen. So, for those working in the field, do you think this field will continue to stay like this...will it get worse or better?Also, Im kind of tired of hearing people say do it if it's your passion..don't do it for the money. I was watching an interview with one of the popular cybersec youtuber and even he was talking about how he personally know talented people who have been laid off and unemployed for months! \nHe said something along the lines of how they're able stay positive because it's their passion or whatever. But I've realized after trying to pursue my passion in pastry, in the end I chose stability over passion. And yes, I know I won't be making bank in this field, but having been paid shit money for the past 10 years and seeing the financial limits in the culinary field, simple livable income and room for growth is enough for me. Any input is appreciated and thank you for reading if you read all of this!",

      "I'm in the same boat as you. Over 50, this is my second career after 20 years bartending, after 12 years of freelance web design.\n\nCurrently working a pretty decent, remote help desk position (with no certs or previosu help desk experience). Just passed my Sec+, and looking to move into Security.\n\nHere's what I know so far...\n\n* When I look on Linked In, there are MANY security related jobs including SOC L1 and above.\n* Security is a general term with dozens of not hundreds of positions that cover anywhere from SOC, Pentesting, Governance-Risk-Compliance, Budgeting and economics, OSINT investigation...I mean the sky is literally the limit. So many ways to go. Personally love OSINT and want to see what I can do with it.\n* Just getting a Sec+ (or any cert) doesn't mean recruiters will be knocking down your door. You have to put the fundamentals on top of it to get a decent SOC job. TryHackMe and HackTheBox have some pretty good SOC related courses.\n* When I started my web design business, it was 2008. Everyone and their mother was trying to be a web designer back then. It was saturated. On top of that,  the world economy was shit. But I knew there were still people out there with money, and I was specializing in a specific thing and there was a need. Starting a business is hard, and there's NEVER a perfect time or perfect economy.   I made it work by becoming a better option and marketing myself well. I feel the same way about this. I need to become a better candidate than the average applicant with nothing but certs.\n\nAbout all that \"passion\" shit. I HATE that word now. If I wanted to follow my passion, I'd be a house music DJ and professional bourbon sampler at a beachside bikini and buffalo wing bar.\n\nI like IT and technology  in general. I like learning about it. Many things about it fascinates me and it seems I have a pretty good aptitude for it and learning new things. I've spent hours watching keynotes just because I find the shit interesting. I watch tech shows and podcasts more than streaming shows and movies. As far as things I would do for money, I think this is pretty awesome and it has opportunity.\n\nIf I wasn't doing this for a living, I'd still probably dabble with my home lab, and learn how to do stuff out of curiosity, but is it my passion? As in would I do it for someone else for free just because I love it so much? F\\*ck no. I'm here to make money. I will do and learn and become what I need to be to make that money..same as when I was a bartender. I loved tending bar. It was fun, I was living in Vegas and living like a true degenerate. It was great. But the money is part of what made it great.  I became the bartender I needed to be, and moved to where I needed to move, to make maximum money and have maximum fun.\n\nI see this (any job) the same way.  What do I need to do to be that guy that employers are looking for, and beat out the competition for that job, and then be able to kick ass and back it up?  Great, I'll do that.\n\nCould I do that for any job? Nope. I like this one.",
      "Infosec is not a 9 - 5 job.\n\nIt typically takes a tremendous amount of work and dedication to get into it in the first place and a lot of effort to progress because the stakes are so high.\n\nFirst read this:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/zrd5c7/roadmap\\_to\\_careers\\_in\\_cybersecurity\\_and\\_cloud/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/zrd5c7/roadmap_to_careers_in_cybersecurity_and_cloud/)\n\nThen this:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/12fwatv/comment/jfia9le/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/12fwatv/comment/jfia9le/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)",
      "**edit for perspective**  30 year veteran of systems engineering (OS2--> Windows --> Linux) and now Solutions Architect \n\nIt's not that the money isn't important, but the primary question everyone who considers Infosec FAILS to ask themselves is \"What do I love to do\"? \n\nIn my experience (non-infosec by CHOICE) there are two primary roles for Infosec experts at most enterprisees.\n\n1.  Triage - Fighting fires\n2.  Audit and Nag (God this is a thankless job where you're setup to fight ALL DAY)\n\nNEITHER of these is why I joined IT.  I have a passion for creating solutions for a business using technology.  New solutions doing amazing things.  I'll NEVER consider an infosec carrer, but applaud those for whom it's their passion.  \n\nSo OP.... What's your passion?\n\nG~",
      ">Also, Im kind of tired of hearing people say do it if it's your passion..don't do it for the money. I was watching an interview with one of the popular cybersec youtuber and even he was talking about how he personally know talented people who have been laid off and unemployed for months! He said something along the lines of how they're able stay positive because it's their passion or whatever. But I've realized after trying to pursue my passion in pastry, in the end I chose stability over passion.\n\nI respect this and I think you *can* make it with this attitude, BUT a big piece of cyber security is trying to solve a problem and thinking outside the box to get there. It has been my experience that those who are there for the money tend to lack in this skill. You might find yourself being passed up if you don't take this part seriously. \n\nAs for the stability of the career field, it's growing in every country I've heard of and there is a global shortage. I know people are being laid off, but honestly I just recently changed jobs and did not have issues doing so. There are rumblings that the US intends to make cyber security a national focus, which will grow the field even more and possibly prompt other countries to follow suit.",
      "> I've been seeing alot of youtube videos of layoffs in the tech field, and how hard it is for these people with years of experience to find a job.\n\nYour concern isn't about any specific field of but rather the exploitation of labor which capitalism demands.\n\nThe truth is that every single person with IT skills on the planet could be put to work today and there still would not be enough skilled workers to meet the actual demand for IT labor in the current market.\n\n> im about to hit my mid 30s and I don't want to invest all this time and money to later be unemployed and still in the kitchen\n\nThe difference between gaining IT skills and working physical labor is that if you treat your body well, in general if you don't develop some issue that hurts your mental faculties your mind will continue to function and even develop and thrive resulting in more skill thus more valued IT labor over time. This is not true for physical labor roles where your labor value tends to deteriorate over time.\n\n> I was watching an interview with one of the popular cybersec youtuber and even he was talking about how he personally know talented people who have been laid off and unemployed for months!\n\nThe problem with this is it is anecdotal. I'd question this data point along the lines of what niche roles these people hold, what actual employment opportunities they have attempted to seek and what market they are looking in. Cybersecurity is an incredibly vast field that is constantly developing and for which there are many, many open roles. I've personally seen very talented people be let go because they were unwilling to work within the business goals of a company.\n\nSomething you need to understand about publicly traded companies is that when \"the market\"/\"the street\" (Wall Street analysts) make a call about what they expect, and each company doesn't respond in kind, the value of the company stock is put at risk. For so many IT companies regarded as \"high growth\" the stock price directly reflects compensation rates for their highest paid employees due to the stock grants that are part of the employees' total compensation. So if Wall Street says they expect a company to justify their hiring over the last 8 quarters int he fact of the forecast of the next 4 quarters, depending on how aggressively they were hiring some companies may need to do a round of lay offs if they don't want their stock price to tank for the next 6-12 months. Here's the thing: just because the company is a \"tech company\" doesn't mean their layoffs are in their IT or engineering staff. For example, a tech company whose main revenue is around cyber security can't afford to let go of cyber security talent, because that's where their revenue comes from. However a company whose primary revenue comes from their CRM software business may be able to shed some of the roles within their security team without impacting their revenue.\n\nTalk to anyone who was mid-career during the 2008-2009 layoffs and ask them how long it took to start hiring back people they laid off. The similarities between the 2008-2009 and 2022-2023 labor downturns are uncanny for those of us who were there. The difference this time is that it was the tech sector rather than the financial sector who got hit the worst.\n\nThe point is that focussing on the current labor situation and social media personalities farming clicks isn't the best source for informing your own career. You should probably look in to the roles you are interested and get a better understanding of how they fit in to a business. This can help you understand which companies you should be seeking out, for example, highly regulated companies who sell services to the federal government or to medical or financial firms will have a huge requirement for meeting regulatory requirements mandated by law and when it comes to selling services to the federal government in particular these contracts tend to last a very long time, basically printing money *provided the firm can maintain their regulatory certification*. In these companies the cyber security domains of compliance and vulnerability management are critical for the business to maintain revenue. By contrast if you are a red-teamer/pen-tester at an e-commerce startup, if times get tough it's no skin off their back to let you go because they can always just rent the same skill set from a cyber security consulting firm (who will probably hire you for that contract after you're let go from the company).",
      "The amount of delusion people think of what it takes to get a cybersecurity job is truly amazing and I have to take my hat off to all these influencer ads that are being pushed to make it seem easy.\n\nNot only does it take grinding and learning multiple disciplines to become proficient in its also an extremely niche field so the amount of jobs will be even more competitive.\n\nMy advice would be to look into IT as a whole instead of a specific field. Work on your skillset and let your career take you where your true interest lie.",
      "Hey,\n\nUK Perspective here,\n\nSo I just landed a fully remote cyber sec analyst role, post about it is over here: (I detail my exp) [https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/15hjdb1/comment/juqluj3/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/15hjdb1/comment/juqluj3/)\n\nFor me to get noticed, I had to sacrifice a hell of a lot - I've loved every minute of the learning process and its fantastic that it's all finally paid off. The reason people want passion is because ultimately, this isn't a field where you can do 1 cert then walk through, especially for the more technical branched roles. You can go GRC/Auditing route which isn't technical, but... it's the least fun, but a foot in the door to then pivot.\n\nYou have to sacrifice a lot of evenings, time with friends, family to get to a level where you can sit at a desk and know exactly what you're looking at (or at least minimal training to get you up to speed). Theres a lot of competition right now from very talented indivuals who have worked in IT for a lot longer than I have who can't break in. I was carried completely by my passion for everything technological & my dedication to self-development - Which was all self funded & done during my lunchbreaks & evenings every day.\n\nIf you're only in it for the money, you won't go far in Cyber (if you get into at all) - Which there isn't anything wrong with, some people prefer to stay at the lower level jobs because less responsibility... Although in cyber you'll already have quite a high level of responsibility anyway.\n\nI'm all for people switching careers into IT, but if that spark ain't there; then guinely... I even wouldn't bother. For most people it's the helpdesk for a few years, which is already a painful process for a lot of people. Then over to network engineer/sysadmin role who then pivot with a small paycut over to Cyber because the higher level roles are more lucrative.\n\nBut hey if you're willing to spend time studying after work, grinding away & letting cyber be on the front of your mind most days whilst working the helpdesk, then Cyber is for you. As others have said, Cyber is just one small branch  of many on the tree that is Information Technology, don't fixate on this niche, who knows you might like Networking more.\n\nHope that helps!",

      "I'm still planning on getting into Security Engineering instead of Education (which I am currently in school for). Sadly it means a big pay cut because education pays a lot better than cybersec in my country, but it's more interesting.",
      "This showed on my suggested feed and since I'm in IT as well, here's my opinion.\n\nHaving cybersecurity as it's own field is disingenuous and damages the IT field and maybe even downgrades someone's real skill because they don't have some piece of paper that says they're good enough. They are one the same, where cybersecurity is an enhancement, or specialty that builds upon the foundation of IT.\n\nThink between nurses, doctors, and surgeons. They're all built upon the same field, same education, same degrees, but an enhancement of the previous.\n\nTidbit, we have a dedicated cybersecurity guy, cert and degrees, but he's worthless compared to our networking and systems guys that know the work, do the work, the full resposne stack. He's a glorified position that at best triages like a sudo manager.\n\nMy opinion, go for IT, but study and emphasize networking as the end goal. Get systems level experience in. Get it all. Then you'll be an effective cybersecurity.",
      "Hello all,\n\nSimilar question if someone is able to help :) \n\n  \nAs the title suggests I am keen on a career change into Cybersecurity and would like some advice on what roles I should begin applying for. \n\n  \nUp until recently I was working as Graduate Lawyer. I've had probably about 1.5yrs experience working in legal practice across a broad range of areas. Working in law I was faced with the realities of the profession and I realised I wasn't happy. In my experience, law is oversaturated with a poor ROI. No matter how hard one tries, personal and professional success isn't guaranteed. However, it's shown me how increasingly reliant we are on tech and sparked an interest/desire to up-skill in Cybersecurity. \n\n  \nIn saying that I hold the following:   \n1. Bachelor of Business (International Business) - also was awarded a Cert IV in International Trade and Dip in International Business during my first year  \n2. Bachelor of Laws  \n3. Graduate Diploma in Legal Practice; and   \n4. Security Clearance Neg Vetting 1\n\n  \nWork Experience was gained in diverse work environments and includes legal practice, the Army Reserves and luxury retail. \n\n  \nMy skillset is unique and easily transferable. Based on my experience I've got a strong customer service ethic, ability to learn fast, strong communication skills with an emphasis on translating tech info to non tech audiences, navigating high-pressure environments, managing competing deadlines and strong prioritisation skills - just to name a few. I am aware I lack the \"tech skills\", however,  I am enrolled in a Cert IV in Cybersecurity (100% Aus Government funded) to hone the technical and practical aspects.\n\n  \nMy question to the community is the following:  \n**1. What roles should I be applying for based on my experience?**   \n**2. If applying for an entry level position like a Service Desk Analyst, what steps should I be undertaking to go from that role to a role in Cybersecurity?**\n\n  \nAnyone who is in the same position, has done something similar, regardless of law or not, please share some advice as it would be appreciated! :)",

      "If you have development experience I'd focus on AppSec or DevSecOps. There's a large need for security focused developers.",
      "Second on the appsec/devsecops recommendation. I was a developer before switching over. Being able to read code and interpret static application security test (SAST) scans and work with developers to help them understand and remediate security vulns is in dire need. \n\nGo check out the OWASP site and familiarize yourself with the top 10.",
      "Agree with others. AppSec is where the money is at. Highest paid technical role in Cyber according to certain polls/research (Stanton House). Currently working my way out of penetration testing and into AppSec",
      "You will be welcomed with open arms in AppSec.",
      "I am in pretty much exactly the same position as you haha. I got my AA in Network security 4 years ago and (technically despite most of that being part-time / internship work) have nearly 6 years experience as a developer primarily in C#. I was laid off in July and then studied for and got my Security+ 2 weeks ago. I should have just signed up to take it about a month earlier because I kept wanting to be more prepared, but there's only so much preparation you can do and later on I was procrastinating a lot... But anyways I skipped doing anything for the Network+ off of advice from other people here. They were saying it was unnecessary since I had the network security degree even though it was a few years old.\n\nMaybe it's just been the jobs I've been looking at (I'm looking for one local to me in MD that will sponsor a clearance), but it seems like having some expertise in some lower level languages (C / C++) is really helpful in software more in line with what we're looking for. So maybe doing some personal projects or courses that would allow you to advertise that on a resume instead of going for Net+ would be helpful to broaden your prospects. It also seems like a certification with AWS or Azure would be helpful to have.\n\nAnd FWIW I've gotten 0 interest (so far at least) in my applications to entry level cyber/network security positions unrelated to software development. I've gotten a few interviews for other programming positions though. Right now I'm just going for any position that will sponsor a secret or higher security clearance and then I shouldn't (hopefully) have any issues getting a more cyber security oriented position later on. I hate the idea of job hopping and stuck with my previous company for my whole working career thus far, but all my peers who have hopped around seem to be much better off than I am now...."
