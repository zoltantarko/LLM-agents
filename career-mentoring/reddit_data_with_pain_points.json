There have not been a lot of jobs in this field so far, I have struggled to bag each job I have now(2 in total)  and I am unfortunately working in this for around 3.5 years now. So I have lost touch with other programming languages I know like C++ and Python.  Thinking about my future, I am scared I will not be able to find a decent job in a few years if the VR industry does not take off.  I am not completely from a creative background so I do not know 3d modeling to have a fully wholistic profile for game development or VR development. \n\nI am thinking of either investing in learning :\n\n*  UI or UX and translating this into VR\n* 3d modelling in Blender\n\n  \nBut again, these are gambles, I think, because it depends on how the VR industry evolves. However, I am passionate about this field. I do not have a lot of interest in game development. When I worked in VR, I always worked on industry-based applications. \n\nOr:  \n\n* Computer Vision and Machine Learning using Python/C++ (have  a little background in Computer Vision, so wouldn't be starting from scratch)\n* Product Management\n* Digital Marketing\n* Web development(especially in web XR)\n\nand I do have an interest in these fields\n\nOr:\n\n* System/Network Admin\n* Embedded Systems(I have a masters in this but do not have any working experience which makes it harder to find a job)\n* C# developer\n\nI feel these three roles have a lot of jobs so I would be doing it to make my life stable rather than for interest. I still have an interest in embedded systems as I did my masters in it but it seems like I will have to again put a lot of effort into learning and getting myself back on track.\n\nI feel like I know a little of everything but no good enough in any  :/ Any help is appreciated!",

I live in Germany since the last 10 years have been working in the automotive industry for the past 7 years and work on a niche tool as a software architect. In all I have a total experience of 14 years in the industry.  \nThe niche tool is now going to move to the cloud and I am transitioning into other roles internally. However, I am not satisfied since the last few years and feel stagnated and stuck. In the meantime, I also suffered from anxiety and depression for which I got therapy and healed, but the scars still remain.  \nI feel I have lost some time to grow in my career. I was a driven and ambitious person who lost all drive since I moved to my current employer around 7 years back and have been stuck in the same job.  \nI also have a credit coming on my name soon and had a baby a few months back so I want to also cover my bases and not take unnecessary risks.  \nQuestions:  \n1. Pursuing a master's degree seems like an option to me but I am lost as to where the market demand is where I would enjoy working (I know AI and ML, but I am not sure I would like to be in those fields). Preferrably, I would like to do distance learning (correspondence courses so I don't have to attend classes).  \n2.

The chaotic nature of Grad School may not be advisable for someone with a baby, anxiety, and depression history; consider certifications instead.\n3. Job opportunities in AI/ML are highly competitive, requiring more than just a degree, particularly emotional resilience.\n4. Career dissatisfaction could stem from personal issues rather than work; a degree might not resolve deeper problems.\n5.

        "content": "Long post warning. I'm in the UK and I've been a teacher for 15 years, I do a good job but it's never been what I desired for a career. I studied maths and got a 2:1 BSc back in 2005. I started an MSc in software engineering but I couldn't keep up with it due to my degree not having enough of the basic computer science grounding required plus I was young and a little stupid. Sadly I only achieved a PGCert (1/3 of an MSc). The UK were desperate for maths teachers (as always) so I decided it was a reasonable path to a guaranteed income and I could look to study some of the basics in my own time and attempt the MSc part time eventually moving out of teaching within 5-6 years.\n\nWell, obviously that didn't pan out, as \"my own time\" was a pipe dream for several years. The recession hit in 2008 stagnating my wages and locking me in a small flat with negative equity and a young family. University fees got hiked massively in 2010, and with each passing year my ability to maintain up to date knowledge in the IT world diminished. In 2013 I hit a low and left a teaching job with the intention of leaving teaching entirely due to stress and disillusionment. Fully expecting to be doomed to dead end, unskilled labour job or destroying my soul in a statistical analyst job. However I was convinced by a former coworker to give post16 teaching a try. My own still strong mathematical skills allowed me to find a bit of a niche teaching the very high end maths such as Alevel Further Maths and IB HL, and helping prep students for university entrance exams for Oxbridge.\n\nWhilst this was far more enjoyable to teach, I still wanted something different. I've always regretted dropping out of the MSc. I had tried to keep up to date and learn skills. I'm the go to guy for any IT stuff in the dept (even over the CS teachers). I taught myself python and VB and used them to create some fun interactive teaching activities.\n\nIn 2018 I took the plunge. The OU were offering loans for part time degrees in specific fields so I committed to studying a BSc part time. I didn't feel confident enough to dive straight back into an MSc after the 2006 disaster, and figured the BSc would give me enough grounding in modern tech and practices that I hadn't kept up with whilst teaching.\n\nFour the last four years I've given up most of my hobbies to pursue this, studying at a faster than recommended pace, completing 11 out of 12 modules. (I had intended to finish all 12 in 4 yrs but COVID happened earlier this year and chronic fatigue for 3 months was too much and I had to defer the final module). I have distinctions in 8, a upper pass in the ninth and I'm expecting high scores in both the modules I've completed this year. My final project module will complete in 2023 now and I intend for it to be within the ML field.\n\nBut I don't know if I can continue this for another 2/3 years after that to get the MSc whilst teaching. I'll be applying for 2023 starting jobs come the September cycles. But I'm up against younger fresh faced graduates in their early twenties. I turn 40 this year.\n\nI suppose my question is, do I have a chance of getting out of teaching and into IT after all this or have I been wasting my time and my life ( and money) for the last four years?\n\nSorry for the rant but this has been playing heavily on my mind and I needed to vent somewhere. If you've got this far, thank you for reading. If you have an opinion on my prospects, good or bad, I'd be very grateful to hear it.",

However, finding an open-minded manager can make all the difference.\n\n4. **Need for Application:** The only way to truly know the prospects of transitioning into IT is by applying for jobs. Encouragement is given to apply to Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) along with larger companies.\n\n5. **MSc Requirement:** Certain specialized fields like AI/ML might prioritize candidates with advanced degrees like a Master's, while general software engineering roles might not necessarily require a higher degree beyond a Bachelor's."

To give some context, the reason I'd like to move is to live with or near my partner whose current job contract requires him to be in the UK until the beginning of 2024.  I would also need visa sponsorship.\n\nA bit of information on my current job. I've been with the same company since I graduated university so I have about 3.5 YOE with them including my internship experience.  I work on an air traffic control program for the FAA here and so the main languages I work with are Ada and C with a little bit of C++.  As such, I've been searching for jobs within the UK that use a similar stack and to no surprise, pretty much all of them are related to some kind of civil or defense work.  How likely would it be for those kind of companies to be willing to sponsor someone from outside of the UK to work on a UK defense work contract?\n\nOf course another idea I've had is to work for company I work for now but remotely from the UK.  My company has presence in the UK and so I've been lucky enough to start a process that MAY allow me to do this remote work.  I currently have an application started within my company that requires due diligence from multiple sectors of the company to review my teleworking request.  I still have about another month left of waiting to see what these results are.\n\nI know that if I were to leave my current job for one in the UK that I would most likely experience a significant pay cut but I'm willing to deal with that in the future.  There's a part of me that would love to get a UK based job (I know that will not be easy of course) to experience the actual work environment there because while I do love the people I work with now, the work/life balance I deal with now is something I'm not sure I'd like to have for the rest of my career.  Is it too naive to think it'll be any different in the UK?  I'm also now a bit worried that my current tech stack just may not be good enough for a lot of positions I see in LinkedIn that seem to really want front-end or more modern language experienced people. \n\nI'm sorry for the long spiel and I hope I've reached the correct forum for these questions.

I am a 21M who just got an offer for a cybersecurity position with no experience so if I could get some general guidance, I would really appreciate that. \n\nSome background information: I have no college degree but I have experience as a manager for a retail store. During an interview for a different position, the company offered me a position in cybersecurity apprentice despite me having no prior experience in anything related to IT. My two years of college will be fully paid for. \n\nWhat little experience I do have is that I have built my own gaming pc twice now and I have made the rock paper scissors code game on replit following a video. My classes start in August but I was wondering if there was anything I could get started on now so that I wont be overwhelmed with work and school on top of the new information I would need to learn. I was thinking of picking up a cybersecurity book for dummies but I felt like maybe I should learn about IT first? And then I got confused and lost so any information would be appreciated!
