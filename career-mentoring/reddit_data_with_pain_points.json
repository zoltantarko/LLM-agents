        "content": "Hello, \nI've been seeing alot of youtube videos of layoffs in the tech field, and how hard it is for these people with years of experience to find a job. I'm worried that I made the wrong choice. I've been working in the kitchen for 10+ years, and during the pandemic I realized that I needed to find a more stable career. I've been in school as a computer information systems major/ minor statistics  because I initially wanted to pursue a field related to data. I've never even heard of data science befofe 2020 lol. But I found about cybersecurity, and from all the youtubers/dept of labor statistics, it seemed like this is a field that will grow tremendously and would be a stable career choice.It also seemed more accessible to older 2nd career adults. I took some elective classes for cybersecurity(networking/ aws) and I've been studying to get certifications. But now Im just seeing way too many people getting laid off and unable to get back in. I just don't want to waste my time.. im about to hit my mid 30s and I don't want to invest all this time and money to later be unemployed and still in the kitchen. So, for those working in the field, do you think this field will continue to stay like this...will it get worse or better?Also, Im kind of tired of hearing people say do it if it's your passion..don't do it for the money. I was watching an interview with one of the popular cybersec youtuber and even he was talking about how he personally know talented people who have been laid off and unemployed for months! \nHe said something along the lines of how they're able stay positive because it's their passion or whatever. But I've realized after trying to pursue my passion in pastry, in the end I chose stability over passion. And yes, I know I won't be making bank in this field, but having been paid shit money for the past 10 years and seeing the financial limits in the culinary field, simple livable income and room for growth is enough for me. Any input is appreciated and thank you for reading if you read all of this!",

        "title": "My job transition",
        "content": "Hi guys! This is my dramatic job transition, tried to make it clean, it's a long read/rant, enjoy!  \nI've been a single sysadmin for 2 years in this company, did it all. When I came, there was nothing but switches and one router on a shelf (35 people), now there are almost 2 full racks, procedures, documentation, segmented departments etc (130 people). They are ISO 27001:2013 certified almost entirely my doing.   \nI've been asking for someone to help since the end of my year 1 there. They agreed to hire someone and put on a Senior sysadmin job ad. 9 months later, still my manager's 30th excuse was that the candidates aren't as qualified as me. Naturally, a few months after they posted the job, I asked why don't they just hire an IT support guy for the small problems and give me the Senior position since I was getting to the burnout state - no answer, even after I pushed for it, just promises.  \nFast forward, a lot of people started to leave at the beginning of the year since there were no bonuses for anyone except management and everyone can see that the company is doing exceptionally well finance wise. The last straw was at the end of this April, when they actually decided to give bonuses to every single employee (10-20% of the full 2018 year's salary + 20% raise). My bonus was a 15 USD raise in salary without any bonus. \n\nAfter such a slap in the face I obviously decided to leave and started my job search, found a great job in a small local data center with around 60 full racks that was expanding fast. Handed my resignation and one week later, I get notified by my manager that a new senior sysadmin is coming next week. In his words \"He's not as good as you, but you left us no choice\". I met the guy, he's actually coming to this position from a management position, suddenly realizing that he has to deal with \"my outlook doesn't work\" types of tickets on a weekly basis (hilarious). I told him what needs to be done by the end of the year. The usual: expand x and y subnets for department a and b, Win7 machines are a priority to upgrade or decommission, install new switch there and there (obviously has to be off hours, which I'm absolutely not doing any more (never got paid for it, just 1 to 1 days off after). I even showed him how to do everything CLICK BY CLICK. This is where I started to get that big fat grin on my face since he had never seen FortiOS, has no experience with clustering or DNS et cetera. Fast forward to my last day I'm sitting on a lobby waiting on the COO to hand me over something completely off-topic and just go home, when this guy comes with my manager.   \n*I'll pause for a moment to describe this guy, he has no backbone, it's not criticism, I've been in that state, but he's completely spineless. I saw this fast and felt a bit for his sorry a55 and stayed one night to do a few of the tasks that he needed to do, like replace and configure some network devices on one of the new floors. Re-showed him for the 4th time how to configure an IP phone et cetera.*  \nSo, here are they and my manager in a micro-panic asks me all the same questions for the 5th time (did you give him that and that and that, did you show him that and that and that). And here's when his voice suddenly emerged (no surprise he has the voice of a 5th grade girl), and started to complain rapidly. \"I wanted to subnet the networks but he didn't have time for me, I wanted him to show me how the redundant VPN works (which obviously I've shown him at least 2 times (it's automatic but sometimes some services do not work as well on the auxiliary ISP and have to be routed manually with a pre-made static routes by just right clicking ENABLE). Side note, I have a cold in that moment.\n\nAnd here is when my face just went 180 degrees (I'll admit, I almost snapped), \"you little sissy, I haven't even left and you're already using me as an excuse ?!\" Got up, bursted into the COO's office, got my stuf and left. \n\nI'm extremely happy at my new job, wouldn't usually take the time to write this (as you can obviously see by my karma), but yesterday I got the last paycheck from that same cheap-a55 IL company - and it was 1/3rd of the money they owed me. I called my boss, who immediately said that this is what he got from accounting. Called accounting - \"this is all we owe you mister\". Called a friend that's a lawyer, he asked me the usual things (how much per months, days off per year etc), who told me to callback accounting and tell them to check a few specific paragraphs from ... the law book (lol... yea, I'm bad at legal stuff). After which they called me back apologizing and assuring me I'll get all my money by the end of the day (yesterday). Here we are, I still haven't gotten 2/3rds of it. Really wanna leave this behind me already and relax.  \n\n\nDon't stay in a place that does not value you, value yourself first!  \nThanks for reading!",
        "pain_points": "1. Delayed payment and partial final paycheck: The frustration around not receiving the full final paycheck on time highlights a common pain point in transitioning between jobs. It can be stressful and financially straining when companies fail to fulfill their obligations promptly, impacting the employee's financial stability and trust in the employer.\n\n2. Lack of value recognition: The post reveals a sense of undervaluation experienced by the individual, as they were offered a minimal $15 raise in salary while witnessing substantial bonuses awarded to others in the organization. This disparity in recognition and compensation can be demoralizing and lead to feelings of resentment towards the employer.\n\n3. Inadequate support and career progression: The individual's struggle to receive the necessary support, promotion, or additional staff to alleviate their workload, despite demonstrating significant contributions to the company's growth and certification achievements, showcases a common challenge faced by professionals seeking career advancement and work-life balance.\n\n4. Incompetent replacement and training issues: The lack of readiness and competence displayed by the incoming senior sysadmin, who previously held a management role, underscores the importance of proper training, knowledge transfer, and suitable hiring practices within organizations. This situation can lead to inefficiencies, errors, and frustrations for both the departing employee and their replacement.\n\n5. Unrealistic work expectations and workplace dynamics: The expectation for the departing employee to continue assisting and training their successor after leaving the company, coupled with ineffective management communication and blame-shifting, reflects a toxic workplace culture and unrealistic demands on the individual. Such scenarios can contribute to burnout, lowered morale, and eventual departure from the organization."

        "content": "Background info on me: i am 23 years old, i went to college for a few semesters before dropping out, and worked in healthcare for 3.5 years, from 2020-2024 (i was a pharmacy technician, and then became a pediatric medical assistant). During this time i also was into web design, and i started freelancing on the side in my free time and making websites for friends, myself, and small businesses here and there (2021-2023). In December of 2023 i started an LLC for web design, and i had 2 overseas employees working for me on a contract basis, and i would serve as project manager. I expanded our services to include web hosting as well, and now we manage web hosting services for a handful of our clients.\n\nOk boom. In july of 2024, i saw a youtube video that was titled start your cybersecurity career in 7 days. While it did pique my initial interest snd curiosity, i was obviously skeptical because i had been hearing about how cybersecurity isnt entry level. That youtube video changed my life. After watchin that YouTube video, i go t the following certifications in a few days: qualys vulnerability management, detection, and response (VMDR), Qualys cybersecurity asset management (CSAM), and qualys vulnerability management scanning (VMS). From there i started getting into cybersecurity youtube, and started finding more free courses. I started the google cybersecurity professional certifcate program, and i loved it. It gave me hands on experience with linux, sql, and python, (3 things i had NEVER used or even seen before). I became obsessed. I started doing TONS of projects, labs, and activities that would help strengthen my skills and resume. Besides those 3 languages, the google course also gave me experience with tcpdump, wireshark, and google chronicle. While i was taking the google course i was also doing some free cybersecurity virtual experience programs on the forage. I completed the mastercard cybersecurity program, the datacom cybersecurity program, the PwC switzerland cybersecurity program, the commonwealth bank intro to cybersecurity program, and most recently the Telstra cybersecurity SOC program. From these i gained hands on skills in other things, like  splunk, cybersecurity engineering, SOC incident response, and more. While i was doing all of this, i was slowly creating and building up both my resume and portfolio, and adding cybersecurity recruiters on linkedin.\n\nAfter completing the google course (which took me exactly two months coincidentally; july 24- september 24th) i started applying to jobs. I was spamminggggg applications and sending messages to recruiters. I just started applying to jobs last friday (september 21st) and sent out probably 200 applications in total. Yesterday, i got my first invitation to an interview, and it was for a cybersecurity analyst position at a bank. I almost shed tears of happiness because of how happy i was that all of my hard work is paying off. Obviously i understand its only an interview, and i dont have the job yet, but still it was so rewarding to see that email, and feel as though my endless hard work for the past few months has been paying off. I am still going to apply for more jobs, and continue to further my education and skills.\n\nI am going to get my compTIA Security+ soon (now that i have the 30% discount voucher i received from the google cybersecurity course) and i also scheduled the free ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity exam for november 6th. I cant wait to keep adding onto my list of skills and certifications. Ive been obsessed with cybersecurity lately, and i hope to make this my new career. \n\nEdit: also, a few ppl have asked about my portfolio, so im going to link it here: [my cybersecurity journey](https://justingoncalves34.github.io/Cybersecurity_Journey/)\n\nEdit 2: didnt get the job ill keep studying though, completing courses, and adding projects and experience along my journey.

I want a laptop because I cant build my own PC right now. \n\nI havent decided if I want to take online guided or self taught courses (like Udemy or Udacity) or enroll back into school, but then I dont know if I would do online (like WGU) or a traditional school like my local tech college. I feel like with online schooling Id get distracted, and lack the motivation and help to complete it, but with traditional school I feel like I might do better because Id most likely have to go in person and physically be there. But regardless I fear that I might end up in the same situation as I was a decade ago. \n\nAnd advice would be greatly appreciated",

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\n**TL:DR: Based on the 5 experiences below, should I change teams, companies, careers, or stay put. Sorry for the long post. (if I should take it down, just let me know)**\n\nSo, I was really hoping to get some advice here. I've been a developer for quite some time, and it has been something of a rollercoaster ride for me. There may be some underlying issues that I've been ignoring, but I was hoping that maybe you guys could help me identify those. My career thus far has been both good and bad, but even in school, it was the same.\n\nThe goal of this post isn't to bash my previous teams, but I truly wonder if anyone has had this much fluctuation in their career path as an engineer. Sometimes, I wonder if this is actually a common occurrence in software development careers, or if this is just a team/company issue. More so now than ever, I've considered switching careers, because it truly seems like it will be a constant.\n\nI've presented 5 distinct experiences so far just so you'd have context. \n\nI would really appreciate anyone's advice, feedback, or guidance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**College:**\n\nSo, in college, I was a Mathematics major. I grew up loving math, and I loved all that you could do with it. However, I learned very quickly that once we got to the proof-based courses (all the others were fine), it was as it I just couldn't think in the same language as my professors. I didn't do very well, but I managed to get by. I also picked up a minor in Computer Science, which was fun with the exception of the OS-level courses. I simply loved how creative I could be with it. So, I pursued a career in software engineering.\n\n**First Job:**\n\nMy first job as a software engineer was both good and bad. I got creative projects and I got to make changes that people around the world could see. I was 100% the \"UI-guy\" at this point, because our previous UI specialist had left the company. I had a role, and it was great. I could be creative at work, and help millions of people. Eventually, we had a re-org, and this put me on a new team, where UI work was not at all something they cared about. More often than not, I found myself in situations where I was asked \"why don't you know this?\" or \"why do you keep looking up how to do things instead of memorizing them?\" This was usually in reference to OS-based things. I tried my best to be useful in every other way I could be, including going through our customers feedback and identifying how we could make our product more useful. I was then presented with the statement, \"sometimes, even if we know we can do something to improve the customer's experience, we simply don't because it means they will pay for our service longer waiting for it.\" I'm not sure why, but this statement bothered me so much, so I left for a new job.\n\n **Second Job:**\n\nMy second job was as a SRE/DevOps Engineer. It seemed like a great opportunity since I could essentially help both the company and the people with it. I could be creative and build tools that hopefully, would benefit everyone. However, while I got to program/code to some degree, most of my job was watching dashboards and rerouting phone calls. Eventually, some of the team took to watching movies or playing video games all shift (and in some cases, bring in their drones) whenever the manager wasn't there due to the sheer amount of down time they had. I quickly watched my team grow in frustration with the way the team was managed, and over my time there, 75% of my team had either left or had been fired (largely due to growing disgruntlement with the way things were). My manager frequently skipped my 1 on 1's with him and eventually, it came to a point where I'd only see him at bi-monthly intervals. I become something of a heads down programmer on the team, building random project and random project, hoping that eventually, someone would pick something up. Finally, I realized no one would, because I was the only one who could code and was willing to. I don't know if my code was good or bad. I just knew everyone was disinterested. So, I tried to move back to a software development team.\n\n**Third Job:**\n\nMy third job was something of a relief for me. I got to develop for a customer facing set of services, and I truly don't think I've ever been so happy for an extended period of time working in my life. There were always things to learn, always ideas to be discussed. and always opportunity for improvement. I think 90% of what I learned as a developer today, was through that team. I did everything I could for the team, and ultimately got a promotion for it. That said, it didn't matter that I got a promotion, because I simply loved the job. Additionally, it was through this job I realized the importance of negotiation of your salary. Mine had been so far off the mark that my team/manager grew concerned for me and fixed it (this was a huge fix). For the first time ever, I felt like I was in a place where I cared about the work, and my team cared about my input. I even led a few projects here and there as well. I truly envisioned staying with the company forever, and potentially becoming an engineering manager at some point because of it. The sheer amount of support I received was phenomenal. However, when COVID-19 hit, of course this shook things up a bit, leading to another re-org.\n\n**Fourth Job:**\n\nFor the first time, even though this was my second re-org, I often wondered why I was placed were I was. I often asked why at this point. Before my official start on my new team, I learned that I would be joining a failing, politically-corrupt team; that the current members of the team refused to teach, learn, or share any new information, because with doing so, it meant their jobs would be in jeopardy of being taken by younger developers. This was a team the entire company needed, but seemed to hate working with. I don't think I truly understood this at the time. That said, I learned why I was put on the team. I learned that I was put on the team solely because I was a DevOps Engineer in the past (work that I grew to hate by this point). The entire goal was to get people together to transform this team, despite expecting some of the other engineers there to push bad. Our tech stack was incredibly old, and the previous team members where clearly specialists. No one was willing to learn anything new. Only the newer members tried. This team was so under water, that asking anyone for help seemed like a huge burden on them. That said, what we heard, was in fact the case. The team eventually was split down the middle as ops and automation. Eventually, the team functioned as separate parts. It eventually became all about systems design and pushing for ideas that we could never get an unanimous decision on (almost always 50/50). Eventually, I had stopped coding entirely, and a bulk of my job had become manual labor (yes, turning devices on and off). I have been a \"software engineer\" for several months on this team, but I've never felt so distant from it. So, as you'd expect, I decided to leave to a more development centric team.\n\n**Today:**\n\nI am posting this because I genuinely want some advice on how to proceed.",

Job satisfaction is not guaranteed and changes are inevitable over time, sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse. It's essential to adapt to these changes.\n\n4. Finding a balance between intellectual stimulation and impactful work can be challenging in software development. Luck plays a significant role in team dynamics and job satisfaction.\n\n5. Choosing to work for reputable companies with strong management can enhance job satisfaction and overall work experience. Considering positions in well-known organizations like FAANG companies or thriving startups may provide more fulfilling opportunities.\n\nThese pain points highlight the challenges faced by the original poster in their career journey and offer advice on navigating team, company, and career changes to improve job satisfaction and fulfillment."

        "title": "Need input on potential career change from IC to EM",
        "content": "So, I've been at my current company for almost 6 years now. It's a big multi-national corporation and I've had the chance of moving laterally across different Business Units and coding in different projects. For the past 3 years I've been working on this BU where I've moved up from SW Eng to a SW Architect (which is basically more design / technical roadmap & mentoring than actual coding).\n\nThe problem is that I've hit the ceiling- in terms of learning and career progression.  Let me explain. For better or worse, I believe I know the current product inside-out and there are no new things for me to learn. Also, even my slightest attempt to introduce new tech, that would improve some of our performance issues, gets blocked by management due to business priorities... In addition, there's no other technical position above my current one that I could move up to (the company is more management oriented when it comes to carving out employees' career paths) and moving to another BU is (for the time being) not feasible.\n\nOn the other hand there are some good things stemming from my current situation. For one, there's no stress at all. I'm totally autonomous, work on my own pace and have no LM pushing deadlines down my throat. Of course, there are project deadlines but my point is that I'm handling them myself- don't have a manager above my head constantly asking for updates and what not. This situation leads to me having a great deal of freedom in the way I work also allowing me to work remotely (even pre-COVID19) whenever I want. This also leads to me being able to completely shut off when I log off and not work outside my normal working hours (I mention this as an advantage because I understand that this is a huge deal in our industry).\n\nAs the title says I'm torn as to what my next step should be. That's why, in an effort to maybe clear things up a bit,  I'm seeking other experienced devs' input on my situation.\n\n**Option #1:**\n\n\\- Stay at my current job. This would allow me to (probably) coast for the rest of my time here and enjoy a totally autonomous, relaxed, low-stress way of life; three elements that are not that easy to find in the industry. As far as the cons go, well, they were pretty much explained above.\n\n**Option #2:**\n\n\\- Move to a new company as an Engineering/Tech Manager. This option would capitalize on the skills I've gained in my current position (tech management of a distributed team, people and tech managing of teams etc). **Pros**: More pay (for some reason management pays more, on avg, than a technical role), more autonomy than a s/w eng. position; better chances of climbing that career ladder as more positions are available to managers (I'm a type A personality...); more impact (?) as I will have a saying on key product/strategy decisions; less stress than an IC (I'm not really sure of this but I think that,on average, the stress of actually building the product is less than managing the guys who build the product); pay is more than an IC **Cons:** I'm not really sure that spending most of my day in meetings and creating ppt presentations will make for an interesting day to day job; not that many open positions for eng. management where I live (this means that If one gets fired there won't be many other similar jobs to go to); Less flexibility than IC in terms of remote work, time off, leave etc\n\n**Option #3:**\n\n\\- Move to a new company as an IC. **Pros:** Will learn new stuff/technologies and day to day will be more interesting than being a manager; More flexibility wrt working from home, working hours etc; Not (much) overtime; Because of the previous points, I reckon that my way of life will be more stable (in contrast to being a manager where there's a tendency to work past 5/6pm); generally, I like experimenting with new technologies and I like implementing mini projects on my spare time so I think by doing that professionally, it'll be a good use of my time **Cons:** less pay than a manager (again this is due to the country/market I'm in), will probably not be that much autonomous due to having a manager above my head and will for sure not be that much autonomous as I currently am, I think that the rush from using new technologies, and building exciting stuff will eventually fade away and in the long run this position will end up being only about fixing bugs. This means that I'll eventually have to move to a new job thus being part of a huge rat race; higher stress- associated with having to keep up with deadlines; unless this job's about a product/service that I'll be heavily invested in (slim chances), I think I'll not be having such big of an impact and will be just another cog in the wheel; I believe I won't ever be *that* good so as to climb to any position. This is due to the fact that there are other devs who are better than me and will have more experience in the new company. So indeed another cog in the wheel...\n\nSo, experienced developers of this sub-reddit, what would you do If you were in my shoes? Any advice? Have you ever been in a similar situation?",
        "pain_points": "1. **Misconceptions about Management Role:** There is a misconception that moving into a management role will result in less stress compared to being an individual contributor. However, the reality is that management comes with its own unique set of responsibilities and challenges.\n\n2. **Lack of Managerial Experience:** Transitioning directly into a managerial role without prior managerial experience can be challenging, as external hiring for managerial positions is limited. It may be more beneficial to gain managerial skills and experience gradually.\n\n3. **Autonomy vs. Control:** While the individual perceives themselves as autonomous in their current role, the reality may be different, especially if management blocks new tech introductions. Moving into a management role may lead to less autonomy and more control over others' work.\n\n4. **Career Progression Considerations:** Progression in one's career can be viewed in terms of complexity and responsibility. Understanding one's objectives in terms of challenging work, increased responsibility, and overall impact can help in deciding between remaining an individual contributor or transitioning into management.\n\n5. **Challenges of Management:** Transitioning to a management role can present challenges in terms of skill acquisition, balancing technical and managerial responsibilities, and managing expectations from both direct reports and upper management. The shift to managing people requires a different skill set and mindset than technical roles.\n\nThese pain points reflect the complexities and considerations involved in deciding whether to stay in a technical role, move into a management position, or explore other avenues such as tech lead roles or starting a side gig."

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nAfter working in my current company for 15 years, I'm planning a career change to IT/Networking. I don't have a IT degree, but I worked in a language lab in my former position (for 12 years) where I troubleshooted computers and worked alongside our IT department. Also, I've been building my PC for years and have troubleshooted other people's PC at work. Currently, I'm a professor at the same university.\n\nMy plan is to take CCNA early next year. I can plan to take A+. My goal is to get an entry-level job in IT/Networking and move up. Also, I'm older (50) so I know this career change will be challenging.\n\nDo you guys think my plan is doable? What other certs or experience do you all recommend I get? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",
        "pain_points": "1. Starting at entry-level in networking without experience is challenging. It is recommended to work on obtaining the A+ certification first and then build from there.\n2. Emphasizing the importance of real-world experiences, especially in troubleshooting computers, and how adding the A+ certification can potentially help in securing an entry-level help desk tech role.\n3. Certifications like CCNA are valuable for exploring different areas of networking but cannot replace actual hands-on experience. It is suggested to focus on gaining experience in an entry-level role to discover specific interests within IT.\n4. Encouragement to take initiative by getting a foot in the door, gaining experience, and then determining the necessary certifications based on interests and company requirements.\n5. Personal success story shared about obtaining a junior network engineer position shortly after obtaining the CCNA certification, highlighting the unpredictability of job opportunities and the importance of pursuing certifications aligned with career goals."

        "content": "Wanting to transition from retail to the IT field with basically no tech background. Would trying to earn a ccna cert. be a good place to start or maybe comptia a+? Just looking to get my foot in the door for now, any advice?",
        "pain_points": "1. Balancing Difficulty and Relevance: There is a debate on whether to start with CCNA or A+ certification. While CCNA is considered better, it is also acknowledged to be tougher than A+. Choosing the right certification path that aligns with the individual's skills and goals can be challenging.\n\n2. Prerequisite Knowledge for CCNA: CCNA is mentioned as a valuable certification that teaches practical skills, but it is also noted that it assumes a good grasp of IT concepts and terms. This poses a challenge for individuals with zero tech background who might struggle to comprehend the advanced concepts covered in the CCNA exam.\n\n3. Comparison of A+ and CCNA: The discussion highlights the vast difference between A+ and CCNA certifications. A+ is described as a more basic and generic certification, while CCNA is seen as offering more practical and in-depth networking skills. The dilemma of choosing between a foundational certification like A+ or a specialized one like CCNA can be confusing for someone new to the IT field.\n\n4. Entry-Level Job Search Pressure: There is advice to start applying for T1 help desk positions immediately, without waiting to obtain certifications. The urgency to enter the job market and gain practical experience can create anxiety for career changers who are still building their technical skills and credentials.\n\n5. Certification Progression Strategy: The progression path from A+ to N+ or CCNA and then security+ is outlined as a recommended strategy for career changers with no tech background. While having multiple certifications can enhance job prospects, the pressure to acquire multiple certifications to reach a competitive knowledge base may be overwhelming for someone starting from scratch."

We would also type in a variety of 'show' commands to verify that it has been properly reset. If we are unsure of the process, we refer to our DL (Department Lead)\n\nI would also like to note that around once/twice a month we would have a special operation where we would decommission server racks in local datacenters and prepare them for transit to one of our facilities to process. Sometimes we would take out the actual servers, and take the individual servers, or we would just take the entire rack itself with the servers within them.\n\nThere are tons of other Network equipment that we process as well, but I don't want to make this post any long than it already is.
