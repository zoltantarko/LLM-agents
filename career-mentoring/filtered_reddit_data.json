It's not going to be long but full of confusion as I don't know what I'm doing.\n\nI started my long career in retail from food, then working in a mall, a computer store, best buy, and a store somewhat like Apple. However, I'm stuck, completely. I have great customer service skills, some Microsoft certifications, and currently working in a company (same company, I had for last 5 years) as a digital sales rep (new role as of Aug 2021).\n\nMy true passion is IT or something of it. However, I have done many great projects, Gaines numerous skills in my time but it sickens and kills me that when I'm looking to move up, I don't know shit about Azure (somewhat), AWS, programming , python, Jira, DHCP/TCIP, networking etc. When I look at their pay, it's LOWER than what I'm making and I'm not even asking much! These fucking jobs asking for so many requirements and it's overwhelming me. I don't know what to do???  I have technical knowledge but not as much as these jobs posts be asking!!!\n\nI've been working since 2006 and finally landed a job in an IT company in 2015 (mentioned above) and it changed my life. I've moved up in many roles I'm that job but I'm finally in \"corporate\" and stuck.\n\n How do I move up? Or how do I look for another job in a other company that will value me and my skills? I got a bachelor's in business and my company is paying for a master's degree in IT. \n\nHow can I gain these skills without certifications or even be considered for interviews/tailor my resume to fit those jobs needs if I haven't done any??? This job market is cutthroat and I'm just trying to put food in the table and not really asking much. Please any words of advice would help as to what I should do.",

Auto rejections from noreply@xxx.com. No way to ask why not considered (some I match everything and some clearly over qualified but pays better).\n\n\nI've spent hours tailoring my resume to each application and have tried tricks to ensure I get flagged by auto screening bots.\n\n\nIt's exhausting and takes a toke toll on self-esteem, etc.",
            "Hi I understand your frustration, I decided at later age as someone not from IT field to enter it and it was totally overwhelming experience. I didn't even know where to start what to learn all that. Then I was lucky enough to stumble upon ZTM (Zero to Mastery) through udemy course with certification and it changed my life completely. I was able to find correct learning path to my dream job. It was much easier with guidance to get proper certificates and skills to achieve my goals. And now I'm half into the path already working on projects from the field. Learning new things everyday. I hope you too will find what you need to move on another level. Your journey will be probably easier since you are not a beginner. I hope this will help you.",

A bunch of my dev friends are all complaining about how they're getting way fewer inbound job offers on LinkedIn, compared to last year. \n\nAnd now that we're in our late 30's and early 40's another group is making plans of switching careers entirely. \n\nI'm curious to know, am I stuck in an echo chamber or is this how the dev community globally feels? \n\nHonestly, it's making me wonder if I should consider creating a career advisor AI. I've previously built a patented model in the parenting space, to help parents make better decisions for their child's future.

It's another thing to flood the industry with tons of printed dollars artificially driving up massive growth and boosting tech salaries (and the SWE population) along with it.

This makes them absolutely useless for creating meaningful output for abstract concepts like \u201cadvice.\u201d What makes advice from *people* useful is life experience. Computers do not experience life.  \n\nWhat looks like advice to you is just a sentence the model pieces together using a map of statistical weights that computes how likely a word is to follow the word before it based on its training data. This does not even yield *valid information* a lot of the time, and you want to use it to guide someone\u2019s life choices? Come on. Think about the consequences of someone using your model the way it is supposed to be used. Then build something else.",

Admittedly, I began as a full stack developer during a high point, mid 2020 and I never imagined things would so quickly take a turn for the worst. I can't even log into LinkedIn without having to come across a bunch of posts about layoffs. \n\nWhile, I haven't been impacted yet, I have developed a somewhat adversarial perspective towards employers which I didn't really have before.  I genuinely feel an anger and distrust towards companies and employers and hate what they've done to my fellow devs. I am working through that as I don't want it to fundamentally change who I am. \n\nI am taking steps to manage my angst by now taking very seriously the advice, \"A Leetcode a day keeps unemployment away\"  and I'm actively interviewing, just in case. I don't love that I have to be in this state of paranoia to work in this industry, but I love the lifestyle it affords me so I'm willing to do what it takes to stay ready so I don't have to get ready. \n\nWondering how my fellow devs are coping,  especially those who have only worked in tech during a bull market, do you feel yourself also becoming disenchanted, bitter or paranoid?",

            "I was the one doing the layoffs, and it's noticeably changed my perception of the industry.\n\nI spent over 20 years making games, where the pay isn't great and the hours are long, but people keep going out of passion for the work. Then I went to FAANG, where the hours were way more sane, the pay was 3x higher, but there was still all this talk of mission, caring for employees, and culture, and long-term investment in people's success.\n\nYes, on one hand you realize that it's a business, that corporations have no soul, and that at the end of the day it's all about money. That's just logical. But after \\~25 years of it *not* working that way for you or the teams you manage, it becomes easy to forget that, and assume that's only the case for other -- dare I say \"lesser\" -- places to work. A certain arrogance sets in.\n\nSo much for that, eh?\n\nAfter 8 years of building teams of hundreds of engineers at FAANGs, and bending over backwards to respect and reward and grow them to the point that even during the Great Resignation, my yearly attrition rates were <0.5%, along comes Wall Street and the c-suite and tells me I need to summarily fire 10%+ of them with about two weeks' heads up. Via spreadsheet. I didn't even get to decide who. Everything was reduced to a number.\n\nWhy? Because our profit margin fell from billions of dollars to slightly less billions of dollars. Heaven f\\*&ing forbid.\n\nI still intend to treat my engineers like actual people, and try to shield them from this soulless stupidity as much as I can, with the obviously limited-but-still-considerable power that I have. I'm not going to succumb to cynical self-interest. But I don't ever trust anyone above me to feel the same way again.

I joined the industry in the early 2000s, companies have always had hiring sprees and layoffs.     \n\n\nOlder tech companies like Oracle, Microsoft, IBM, Cisco, HP would regularly cull divisions every couple years.   Sometimes good employees would get wacked, sometimes they'd dodge and get recruited to another team, sometimes you're unemployed for six months etc.    \n\n\nEven when FAANG emerged as the super awesome place for devs to work, Amazon, Meta, G, and Netflix would regularly manage folks out pre-pandemic.  Sure some folks could coast depending on your manager, but it wasn't guaranteed.   I knew people who lost their jobs at those places before the layoffs, just like I know people who got rich from these companies.\n\n\nI guess what is surprising to me is that so many people came into the tech industry thinking it was a magic industry that was guaranteeing riches, perks, and job security...",

Remember there are lots of people [outside of this industry] that think $20/hr is a good wage because they have never seen that much at a job.

Sure, theres more anxiety now, but this too shall pass.\n\n My contract was timed badly and I've maxed it out, so I'll be out of work soon for now.  \n\nIn the meantime I'll be ready to either pivot jobs as necessary while practicing coding and making projects to get back in when I can. \n\nCycles happen, always be mercenary with your work, but in tech, its possible to make so much that its easier to save for rainy days than in other industries.",
            "So I got laid off in January while on paternity leave. At the time I was looking forward to having an easier year while dealing with lack of sleep.

I had been employed for nearly 2 years with the company and told I was safe before leaving for paternity leave, so I hadn\u2019t even thought about interviewing or prep. Now, I think I\u2019ll do at least some prep every 3 months or so. Also, as some others have mentioned, the job market for Jr. and entry level positions is almost non-existent. I have friends who have recently graduated or have 1-2 YOE applying for job after job with no success. I had no issue getting interviews (specialized field, 7 YOE) for mid and senior level. I think it was in part due to having contacts/recruiters at other companies. If you are applying through websites you\u2019re unfortunately one of 50-500 people. \n\nOverall, I think this is all just getting started and even though I have a new job, I\u2019m not going to be considering myself safe for a long time.",

Secondly when layoffs did happen they let go whole teams that had services that were deeply integrated with teams that were left. They offered 0 transition plans and the people at the bottom were scrambling to try to even inventory the systems that would need their support structure changed. It was the basic fucking responsibility of the people who decided to do layoffs to ensure business continuity after layoffs and they just didn't fucking do it.

            "I think you should distinguish between **tech company** layoffs and other industries. Most other industries are barely touched by layoffs. The problem with big tech is they over-hired and over-paid, based on absurd long term growth projections that were unsustainable, not too different from the Dot Com Bust of the early 2000s.\n\nThe software development field has stabilized. But there is something seriously wrong with the management (or I should say, the **investors**) at Big Tech though. They sold Gen Z a bill of goods and lied to them about the proliferation of jobs and money in this field, and after a huge surplus of developers entering the field it's now contracting back to where it should have been in the first place.\n\nIt's a bad time to be inexperienced and trying to break into this field. The competition for entry level and internships is fierce. I do not envy at all. And if it were me I'd probably go back to school for an Engineering degree (which was my original major). Engineers have no trouble finding jobs, and they have the best salaries around now.\n\nIf you have development experience, there are a **lot** of jobs out there right now. Recruiters are calling me daily, the most calls I've gotten in 20 years, and they are almost all remote jobs and almost all paying more than I make. I have senior friends who have been jumping jobs at will the past year. And they are raking in the dough.\n\nBut I would be careful about just blaming \"employers\". For the most part employers just want to run their business and earn a profit. They're not out to get you. If they are not hiring, instead of insulting them you should try to understand why and figure out what they *are* hiring for. My manufacturing company brings in lots of Engineering interns, experienced Engineers, and hourly labor all the time, because the business is doing well. What they are *not* hiring is any software developers, even though we badly need more. Because they are just too expensive and the company has decided they aren't worth the cost for what they get in return. So that means that every project is now being slowed down, delayed, shelved, or canceled. So we just have to make do.\n\nHowever they are hiring IT people, probably another 5-10 by the end of the year. But they have stopped hiring developers. Financially if you do the math, you can get 3 -4 IT people for the same cost as 2 devs. So that's what they are doing.\n\nBusiness budgets are all about priorities and return on investment.",

A job is never guaranteed, and thinking you'll always have a job because you're a \"good boy\" and hard worker is an ignorant belief. Even in good times companies can go through restructuring or the owner can want to sell and the new owners can come in and cut out half of the current work force. \n\nAlways always always have at least a 6 month emergency fund. Before making any kind of large purchase make sure you are in a very solid financial position to do so. \n\nNever get attached to a job or company. When it comes time for layoffs they'll let you go and say something along the lines of \"we really like you but this is just a business decision etc\". \n\nA job is just a job. It doesn't define you.

It _could_ help in specific jobs that need both medical and technical knowledge, but you'd be very limited if you only looked for those jobs vs just any developer/IT jobs.\n\nBest thing you can do is start self-teaching the basics.

I'd assume you're already also pretty familiar with the regulatory side of that industry -- HIPPA, the FDA approval process, et al. I try to avoid that side of the industry because I really wouldn't want someone's life to depend on my software, but based on the other programmers I've met in the past three decades, I'd much rather my life depend on code I've written rather than code they have.\n\n\nIf you want to use that obvious \"in\", maybe contact companies doing medical software.

I wont come close to making enough to survive. So how does someone who made 150K to 250K a year.. switch to 35K a year.. and yes I am well aware of the \"live within your means\" but when you make 150K+ a year and you save a bit but also live a bit more.. e.g. buy a bigger house for your kids, etc.. and now you're faced with working 72 hours a day to make similar money.. I mean I am fully willing to accept 1/2 the pay to land a coding job.. but ageism is a REAL fucking problem in our industry, as is the need to memorize shit I did 25 years ago and have never.. not one time used in any part of my career.. just to land a job. \n\nBasically.. the tech field especially for developers is broken. It only caters to those that are able to solve leetcode style problems.. not experience (largely). It's a very VERY drastic change from just a few years ago, where having 15+ years of experience was highly lauded after. Now.. it's like you need between 5 and 10 years thats it. Anything more and you're now too old. Less you're not experienced enough. And yes I am aware that this isnt for everyone across the board. \n\nSo now I have to go back to trying to study leetcode JUST to get a job.. and it will have no bearing on the actual work I do. My experience in a few areas that are quite in demand right now.. doesn't matter. That I couldn't solve some sliding index sorted array question that is already optimized in a library so I would never write it anyway.. is unreal to me that all my experience in the in demand areas is ignored. It's a VERY broken interview process especially for more senior level engineers. Why would a senior to staff level need to demonstrate coding.. if my resume indicates I been working for years as a coder at some decent to good company's.. is it not understood I'd have been fired long ago if I couldn't code? I mean.. I get it if you have multiple 1 year or so job hops on your resume with breaks in between.. that may look like you had issues holding down a job... or you could be one of those that just job hopped for money. But I stayed at company's for 4+ years at a stretch so it baffles me why I am expected to do the same coding shit in an interview I did 20+ years ago. OF course someone right out of college is going to solve it better than I Can.. that is all they got to go on and they been studying/learning it for months/years. \n\nI told a bunch of kids recently to NOT go in to the CS/coding career. IT's WAY WAY too volatile and everyone is just a number now.

I'm Canadian and recently looked for a new job. I don't do leetcode, so I avoided places that are known to have leetcode-focused interviews. I ended up spending a couple weeks applying to \\~20 places (was very selective, and the Canadian market doesn't have as many high-end roles as the US market). I ended up getting two interviews (one big tech, one remote SV startup), which led to two offers, and now am starting a role that's an enormous upgrade in comp.\n\nIs that lucky? Yeah.\n\nIs it that incredibly uncommon? No.\n\nThe market is really difficult for juniors right now, and it's difficult even for average developers. If you're good at what you do though, and are able to speak to it in an interview process, it's certainly not this looming impossibility to find a new role. This also goes back to it not being a great field if you see it as other 9-5 jobs and don't have passion in it though. There's nothing \\_wrong\\_ with that -- a job is meant to be something to support your life -- but in highly lucrative, low barrier to entry, careers like this, it's not the type of person that's going to succeed unfortunately.

The grinding, the hours behind the screen, the constant pressure to deliver. Its just too much. I'm not quitting now but I've put a plan to move away from software here's why:\n\n1- **Average Pay:** Unfortunatly the pay was not worth all the stress that you have to go through, It's not a job where you finish at 5 and clock out. Most of the time I had to work weekends and after work hours to deliver tasks\n\n2- **The change of pace in technology**: My GOD this is so annoying every year, they come up with newer stuff that you have to learn and relearn and you see those requirements added to job descriptions. One minute its digital transformation, the other is crypto now Its AI. Give me a break\n\n3- **The local competition**: Its so competitive locally, If you want to work in a good company in a country no matter where you are, you will always be faced with fierce competition and extensive coding assignements that are for the most part BS\n\n4-  **Offshoring:** This one is so bad. Offshoring ruined it for me good, cause jobs are exported to cheaper countries and your chances for better salary are slim cause businesses will find ways to curb this expense.\n\n5- **Age:** As you age, 35-50 yo: I can't imagine myself still coding while fresher graduates will be literally doing almost the same work as me. I know I should be doing management at that point. So It's not a long term career where you flourish, this career gets deprecated reallly quickly as you age.\n\n6- **Legacy Code:** I hate working in Legacy code and every company I've worked with I had to drown in sorrows because of it.\n\n7- **Technical Interviews:** Everytime i have to review boring technical questions like OOP, solid principles, system design, algorithms to eventually work on the company's legacy code. smh.\n\nI can yap and yap how a career in software development is short lived and soul crushing. So I made the executive descision to go back to school to get my degree in management, and take on a management role. I'm craving some kind of stability where as I age I'm confident that my skills will still be relevant and not deprecated, even if that means I won't be paid much.\n\nThe problem is that I want to live my life, I don't want to spend it working my ass off, trying to fight of competition, technical debt, skill depreciation, devalution etc... I just want a dumb job where I do the work and go back home sit on my ass and watch some series...\n\n**EDIT 1: I come from a 3rd world country Lebanon. I'm not from the US or Europe to have the chance to work on heavily funded projects or get paid a fair salary. MY MISTAKE FOR SHITTING ON THE PROFESSION LOL**.\n\n**EDIT 2: Apparently US devs CANNOT relate to this, while  a lot of non-western folks are relating...Maybe the grass is greener in the US.. lolz**.\n\n**EDIT 3: Im in Canada right now and It's BRUTAL, the job market is even worse than in Lebanon, I can barely land an interview here, TABARNAC!**.\n\n**EDIT 4: Yall are saying skill issue, this is why i quit SWE too many sweats** \ud83d\udc80",

Middle management is a basically a shit sandwich between your reports who don't want to do shit and don't know how, and execs that only want more. You're entire day is having your attention subverted to deal with requests and problems, so many that you don't have time to do it all.\n\nAt the very least, try to go into something like product management. You do have to manage things, the MBA will help, and it doesn't have the downsides of you having to learn new technology. Also, you can use your previous experience as a SWE so you aren't starting at the bottom.",

I once worked at a small startup in which I related with the points in the post, eventually I had to realize the company wasn't a great place to work, so I made up my mind to search for something else and then left.\n\nThe options that are at your reach play a pretty important role on how you view this industry. If you live in the US/Europe then it can be as easy as spending a couple hours at LinkedIn, applying for a couple roles and then maybe you can land a new good paying position within a month or so, but it's not as easy for everyone everywhere.\n\nDo what sits right for you OP, I'm sure as hell I wouldn't be able to live in those conditions and that's how I felt when I worked at that shitty company I mentioned before.

Some schools only use primary languages and decades old product.\n\nI know I only knew how to use Flask, but then I was exposed to Angular and React- something that saved my career because they made things click whereas Flask just kind of was a painting by numbers.\n\nThe ONLY way some people are exposed is by being forced into them. Then something clicks. \n\nI felt like such a loser for half of my career because I was a legacy developer, working on cobal and mainframes. My education prepared me for 1/20th of my career because actual paradigms have shifted from functional, to oo, to event based.\n\nTake a deep breath. Ask someone you trust at your workplace how long they took to acclimate. It may be a shop issue- if they are spreading their stacks all over the place and requiring too much from each developer. That\u2019s just shitty team structure.\n\nScrew the guys saying it\u2019s a skills problem. Maybe grit, but there are tons of other factors and you don\u2019t need to feel gaslit.

Umm no I don't know what you mean there is literally no one in the world I can ask for free money.  This also goes along with contacts with companies and such is my point.\n\nI had a (former) friend who's parents paid for him to live in a luxury apartment(and everything else) a block or so from the startup district for 10 years tell me that I just wasn't grinding as hard has he did to justify his success(got 10mil or so from an exit after 5-6 statups).

So if you find software development stressful, its probably because you have a shitty manager.\n\n>**Im in Canada right now**\n\nThis is a huge factor. If not THE MAIN reason why things are as shitty as they are.\n\nCanada absolutely sucks for software engineering. All of our major cities with high paying software engineer jobs are almost as expensive as the major US tech hubs. But the average SWE salary is about half of what you would get in the US (and that's not even factoring in the USD being better than the CAD).\n\nIf moving to the US is not an option for you, then consider looking for a remote roll at a US company. Thats what I did, but I got lucky because everyone was hiring remote during covid.

            "Hey budd, I am originally from Lebanon like yourself, and worked all my career outside of Lebanon, but made the fatal mistake of moving back to Lebanon and currently chilling in the warzone.  \n  \nI will comment point by point:\n\n    1- Average Pay\n\nYou are correct. The only nation that truly respect software engineers is the US, make no mistake. The only country that pays well for this field. Now you will get comments from people not in the US and telling you they make good money, please note there are people who haven't got any engineering or CS degree and moved from a minimum wage job to programming after bootcamp or something. For those, the upscaling in salary sounds pretty good. I assume you have a CS background, so yes for a person who went to university this field doesnt pay well unless you move to the US. I wish someone told me that long time ago.\n\n    2- The change of pace in technology\n\nIt does indeed change at a super fast pace, faster that most other fields. However it is what it is, if this is the main reason you feel like quitting, don't . Take breaks (min 3 weeks) and during those break do stuff that have NOTHING with technology, for example farming.\n\n    3- The local competition:\n\nIt is competitive locally, but more globally. From your edit I understand you are in north america, lots of outsourcing shops there to India. Again, the best place is the US, because it is a massive market and as much as there is competition, there remains lots of opportunities. Make no mistake, once again when it comes to software engineering the US is the land of opportunity. PS: Nowadays, post covid and ukraine war, must inquire further even for US jobs, as I am reading online from several source market is shit everywhere (any US engineers here to confirm?), so do your due diligence.\n\n    4- Offshoring\n\nExplained in (3)\n\n    5- Age\n\nNot necessarily. There is aging in some places especially startups (not because age means you cant code, quite the contrary, but because they want newcomers who don't know better and would work for peanuts). But it is more inflated in media and online than in reality. I know respectable companies like Google for example, hires experienced engineers, I read several times about folks older than 60 who got hired at google. So don't self indoctrinate about things that are not always true.\n\n    6- Legacy Code\n\nYeah all places have that. If you want to work without legacy code, only fresh startups are good environments for that.\n\n    7- Technical Interviews:\n\nYeah that is the WORST part of this whole career. It has become harder to interview than actually performing the job. Once again, this wont be changing anytime soon, we have been suggesting new interview approaches to companies and through conferences and others, to no avail. This sadistic interviewing system seems will stay there for a while unfortunately. I personally blame the very \"smart\" idea that \"entrepreneurs\" came up with, which is: anyone can code (even your gramma) and no need for degrees. Which in reality is a smart way from business people to lowers salaries, ie flood the market with \"engineers\" and automatically salaries get lowered. As a side effect, many folks who have no clue started interviewing, and companies started throwing exam like interviews which historically was handled by having a diploma which meant: hey those algorithms that i will probably never use in your company, i already studied and aced them during 5 years of studies, and if needed i could easily ramp up.\n\n    I can yap and yap how a career in software development is short lived and soul crushing. So I made the executive descision to go back to school to get my degree in management, and take on a management role. I'm craving some kind of stability where as I age I'm confident that my skills will still be relevant and not deprecated, even if that means I won't be paid much.\n\nOk that is a personal choice, you know what is best for you.\n\n    The problem is that I want to live my life, I don't want to spend it working my ass off, trying to fight of competition, technical debt, skill depreciation, devalution etc... I just want a dumb job where I do the work and go back home sit on my ass and watch some series...\n\nSoftware engineering is indeed a demanding job and it feels like the learning curve never ends. I kinda get where you going, but you gotta inquire about other jobs from people in those fields (working in the trenches) to see if the job is really 'dumb' or it actually requires more efforts than portrayed. Like don't underestimate anything.\n\nPS: lots of comments attacking you here and telling you 'you have skill issues'. I have been working in this field for long, this comment always surfaces anytime someone is struggling and need answers. Don't let it get into you, you have no skill issues. I guarantee you, the top skilled software engineers will NEVER put others down quite the contrary they are proud of their skills and would love to teach it to others. Those who decide you are unskilled  from a reddit post, are themselves unskilled most probably and so compensating, or haven't worked on a real life scalable project but been doing pet project or hello world tutorials.  \nIf you decide to stay in this field, the number one skill you will need is : build a thick skin. That is the major skill, the field is filled with people with inflated egos that are not there to cooperate but to tell you they are smarter than you. A thick skin is required, mute them and move forward with focus.\n\nWhatever you decide, wish you all the best.",

It is like US universities giving college students financial aid when in fact its fucking LOANS. They give it a nice label \"financial aid\".\n\nN. America is all smoke and mirrors marketing.

I'm over 40 and especially now hate to do that. I try to keep my learning opportunities to work as much as possible so I don't also have to study as much on top of working.

But all I had to do was tell the managers no, go talk to our tech lead. \n\nIt's the job of your supervisor to coordinate demands and requests, plan ahead, etc. If you feel like there are unrealistic demands being placed on you, make sure you're not just a yes-man listening to all the bullshit management is coming up with.\n\nIf the head of the SW department/tech lead/whoever is above you is not able to isolate you from management and is not able to create realistic timelines, then voice your opinion. Instead of complaining anonymously here, take charge and address the problem directly. In the worst case, they won't like it and will eventually let you go.

            "I had pretty bad undiagnosed ADHD in college. I was smart enough to pass with pretty good grades in high school but as soon as I got to more difficult subjects I struggled to have good study practices and my learning style did not coincide with how colleges typically do things. Frankly, I just do much better in an office setting with real stakes and products.\n\nAt my first job, at a small company, I was mentored by the director of software engineering directly almost daily for 2 years. He did extremely in-depth code-reviews on my PRs, challenged me constantly, and most of all, believed in me when I didn't think I was even worthy of it.\n\nA few years later after being promoted and looking for new jobs, I accepted a new offer at a relatively well-known company (where I currently work). I get beaming performance reviews, my manager entrusts me with absolute autonomy and I'm the go-to person for code review and front end design across my department.\n\nIt truly was about _getting the support I needed_. I have no idea where I would be without my first mentor, but I know I wouldn't be as successful as I am. I think about how grateful I am for him and how lucky I am almost every single day. A lot of it was also about _getting to know myself and the type of person I am_ (I'm very fucking weird in a lot of ways; highly ND), and from there I could take steps towards investing in myself and growing. My soft skills are pretty good, so being able to leverage those to build relationships in the workplace has also helped a lot. That contrasts pretty heavily with how the school system works.",

And the foundation of knowledge school had given me, combined with having actual industry experience, really set me up to be able to truly understand and embrace the concepts that were once very boring and difficult to wrap my head up around.\n\nNo one ever asked for my GPA (maybe one or 2 internships did). I became an expert in many technologies. For a long time I carried imposter syndrom, as there were always engineers who just seemed to be experts in SO MANY things. And the, one day...I was the expert everyone came to. It really caught me off guard.  \n\nWhile focusing on something I wasn't interested in had always been difficult, on the job there was always SO MUCH that I could really pick and choose. There was always SOMETHING to excel at that caught my interest. And it turned out I was very much a big picture thinker (something my ADHD really helped with). I was naturally gravitating into leadership positions so I eventually decided to develop leadership and management skills intentionally. I spent many years as a consultant which helped a lot. Worked in startups and big tech and eventually decided companies making the transition from small to mid sized was the sweet spot for me.\n\nIn hindsight, school just was never going to be a place I thrived. The stakes were intangible, the knowledge to divorced from reality, and things were just too ridgid. Though I'm still eternally grateful for my CS education. And in my career I've found that many of the personality traits that were problematic for school were actively helpful in my career. \n\nSo don't worry about it too much. We all change a lot in our lives, and school is not a great predictor of career success. It's such a different environment than business. \n\nAs a society I think we focus too much these days on STARTING with passion for a career. Passion can develop naturally with mastery.\n\nThe last thing I would say is...don't romanticize \"big tech\" TOO much. They really don't generally select for the best of the best, and most of the work is really not THAT interesting. They select for good and safe. If you really want it I'm sure you can get in some day. Not right now, the market is awful. But once you have some experience your school and gpa really don't matter. For the past 10 years what mattered was your ability to communicate and solve algorithmic problems in 30m or less. Before that it was brain teasers, looking the look, and being \"passionate\". I'm sure it will be something new in another 10 years.\n\nIt's just another job at a big company that pays in the 80th percentile. Which is good, but not the mythical unicorn many make it out to be. The biggest thing that sets big tech apart isn't the quality of their employees (which is above average, but not amazing), the pay (which is very good, but not the best), or the work you do (which is mostly pretty boring stuff that very few people ever see). It's the fact that they are easy to point to and hire a LOT. \n\nI've worked at some amazing places, but I couldn't give ANYONE advice to go and work at those places as a career path. They employed less than 40 devs, come on. What made them amazing was that their needs lined up with mine and the timing was right. It was the team, the need, the leadership, and the market all lining up.\n\nWhat makes big tech special is it's predictable. Not that it's amazing. You can tell someone, \"If you want to make X per year then study these things, work on these skills, present yourself in this way, and apply to companies X, Y and Z every six months. You have a 90% chance of achieving those goals within 3 years.\"\n\nWhich is great, don't get me wrong. I'm REALLY not knocking it. If you lived in the area they were hiring it would be a very solid plan.\n\nBut don't get the image in your head it's some sort of amazing achievement or a place where you'll work with the best of the best and the most amazing and fulfilling projects. They're just nice, predictable, stable, big corporate jobs with solid, above average pay. A good place to trade time for money and feel secure in your retirement.",

            "I was roughly an 80-92 student in terms of high school grades. Never the best and never the worst. I got anxious and stressed easily. Some high school courses were harder than college. Did not finish college. I had a bizarre problem throughout high school and college where I was passionate about the science courses I took (biology, chemistry, physics), I genuinely studied, but did awfully on tests which were the majority of the grade. It was really disheartening to like something and yet do so poorly. For other courses I will admit I had an inconsistent work ethic. I would study to exhaustion for a history class, then fail math because I had used the time for history. Then I would be behind in math and have to catch up rapidly. Whatever I did never seemed to work. It was like when one thing got better, the others would get worse.\n\nAs an adult I have a better and more balanced work ethic. Work isn\u2019t like school. School doesn\u2019t let you revisit past work. School doesn\u2019t ask for your opinions on implementation and actually do the implementation. School requires you to make things on the deadline or it\u2019s failed. Work has more flexible deadlines, work asks for opinions, etc. Oddly, school is set up in a more difficult way than work. A lot more of us would be PIPed if work was more similar to school. \n\nI worked customer service in Big Tech for about 2 yrs, then got promoted to a very junior project manager + very junior analytics role. Then I was promoted to an actual business analyst role after about 2 yrs. Then moved on to another mid size tech company after about 2.5 yrs in a much more technically demanding analytics role. Spent 2.5 yrs there and quit earlier this year. I qualify for Sr Analyst roles, I get a reasonable callback rate, and ace interviews pretty easily. I would have never predicted this outcome based on my high school and college self especially because I don\u2019t have a degree.",

But it was really hanging out with a couple of people who went to big tech and realizing that we\u2019re all just regular people that kind of \u201cunveiled the shroud\u201d of working at cool companies with great compensation.\n\nMost people working in the FAANGs and Unicorns of the world are just regular people who knew what to study and what to learn.

I\u2019ve always had an interest in tech but never thought I could make a career out of it until this year. I made myself an intensive boot camp schedule and been studying a lot, although all of it has been self taught, it\u2019s going great and I have learnt a ton. I have a couple of questions and I hope this is the right place to ask. Firstly I\u2019m applying for a government funded 8 week course with an interview with employer at the end of it (no where near ready for employment at the minute but it will be good experience) They have asked to see my CV as part of my application, I haven\u2019t looked at my CV for quite a long time and I don\u2019t know where to start trying to update it. Second question is about LinkedIn and what should I write as a headline, I\u2019ve just added my online certifications I\u2019ve achieved this year.  Lastly how I prove what I know as I don\u2019t have a degree and self taught?

This is amazing and takes great discipline. You may not realize, but the ability to do this is actually more important than anything you learn. This is a _meta skill_ that you'll continue to do for the rest of your career. You are already ahead of so many people that haven't strengthened this skill yet.\n\n>  I haven\u2019t looked at my CV for quite a long time and I don\u2019t know where to start trying to update it. \n\nNo worries, put your certs you've gotten this year, list the main technologies you're familiar with, and some projects you've done. _Keep it to 1 page._ The CV / resume's only job is to get an employer to pick up the phone, so while this may not seem obvious, you only want enough information on the CV to peak their interest.  A clutter-free CV with plenty of white space is your friend.\n\n> Second question is about LinkedIn and what should I write as a headline\n\nIf you're doing web development, just title yourself as a Web Developer. Do *NOT* put \"aspiring\" or \"junior\" on your CV / LinkedIn. Let an employer decide how junior you are or aren't.\n\n>  Lastly how I prove what I know as I don\u2019t have a degree and self taught?\n\nThis is done holistically through your CV & projects. Also, I would think about keeping a blog to do some \"public learning\" e.g. blogging about things as you learn them. This also re-enforces what you've learned simply by teaching it through blog posts.\n\nI'm sure you've already done this to get to the point you're at now, but be sure to watch plenty of tutorials on your particular stack / tech, and podcasts help too to absorb the lingo so you can speak with authority. \n\nBest of luck OP!!",

            "Make sure you take some time to really research what type of job you're targeting so your resume and most importantly study can be tailored to that. A lot of juniors are understandably thinking \"I don't really care what I do, I just need that first opportunity.\" Which is perfectly understandable, but the more you can 'brand\" yourself as a particular role the more likely you will be to get opportunities in that area.  \n\nDon't be afraid to do have multiple resumes that communicate different things.  For example, have a resume that is targeted specifically for listings where skills/portfolio match the job opening well and you've done your market research to know you're competitive vs the \"shotgun resume\" you're going to send out to every software company job listing regardless of how well the role matches just as an outside chance.  \n\nAlso take a bit if time to prepare yourself for coding interviews.   Take this sub and all the others with a grain of salt because it's a bunch if hyper competitive over achiever types with crazy young adult anxiety, but you should at least have enough knowledge of the interview process that none of it comes as a surprise to you if someone starts giving you a leetcode style coding test.",

            "You're going to need a bit of a non-traditional CV. So you should list the skills you are proficient in: Algorithm design, runtime analysis, data structures, etc. Maybe even with a breakdown in between.  \n\n\nYour previous work experience is probably going to be useless. So, instead, list your most impressive portfolios under a \"Projects\" section and describe them as if they were your job. \"Designed and implemented CRUD interface over a *<insert other technologies>* UI with a focus on User Experience\" ... stuff like that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLeave off an education section unless you have education beyond high school that is somehow relevant or at least a bachelor. If you've attained a bachelor's degree that at least shows you're capable of working.\n\n  \nWhen you start a serious job search, it wouldn't hurt to have internships, either. They are generally easier to get, but usually harder to get for non-student types. So, landing one would give you work experience, which is gold. Work experience on your resume is more important than any other thing you could put on it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast, as you're a female (and this is totally screwed and I don't condone it, but it's the situation as it is) you need to focus on appearing feminine in a professional, non-flashy way. That means do your hair flat, practical and proper, don't wear many non-neutral bright colors, light on the make up, no excessive jewelry and keep your jokes light and professional (you don't want to appear \"bubbly\", because many sexist folks equate \"bubbly\" with \"airhead\". But you also want to appear personable). Job markets are sexist, unfortunately. It's not nearly as rampant as it used to be, but you still don't want it hurting your chances.   \n\n\n  \nLast *lastly*, good luck. What you're doing isn't easy, but it's totally doable with hard work and discipline. You will hit serious road bumps that look like brick walls. But, they're not. Work around them, even if it means a bit of sacrifice. One thing I figured out having a child while making a career: It sucked for him in certain ways. But he has now grown up seeing first hand what it takes to make a career if you don't follow the proper steps/get it right the first time. Moreover, he's seen an example of what it looks like to want something and GO GET IT. It's really an invaluable lesson that is rare for children to see first hand. So, when you feel guilty about sacrificing time or inconveniencing your children, just keep in mind that you're also teaching them a lesson that's very, very difficult to teach: That aspiration means changing your life and sacrificing small things for long term reward and if you get hungry for something, the only thing between you and it are the decisions you make and time.",

Actually MAKE a resume. \n\nSecond tip: This really sucks and slows down the process if you are applying to multiple jobs, but tailor your resume to each individual job listing that you ACTUALLY are seeking. \n\nRecruiters are using AI filtering. It's garbage. It's annoying. But they are using it. I also have found that some sites might prompt you to opt out of AI filtering. Think of this from the recruiter side - they likely want AI to do the legwork, so odds are they will favor applicants who the AI screened already. We're stuck playing their game. \n\nYou have to play with keywords and phrases. \n\nLooking to apply for a job?

Outside of my first job, I\u2019ve never applied the \u201ctraditional\u201d way. Either a recruiter from the company reached out, I got a referral from a friend, or I met a recruiter at an event and things took off from there.\n\nThat said, even my friends who\u2019ve been laid off aren\u2019t struggling to find work\u2014they\u2019re just having trouble landing a job as good as their previous one.

I suggest spamming more applications and checking\n* \"I have been mocked, insulted, told that I don't have real experience.\" It's part of the game, most companies are not really hiring right now, they just have to show that they are growing.

I would like to add that it's a difficult market, there are a lot of people looking for a job, so it's pretty common to find a rude attitude during an interview. Honestly, it's better to not work with rube people so don't be sad about that.\n* \"Non-technical recruiters asking me that \"Okay, you know React, but do you know HTML? It's not on your CV\".\"  hr changes jobs more often than developers, most of them just look or ask for keywords or stick to what the company has said that they are looking for. It's a good opportunity to work on your soft skills \"Thanks for your question, of course, I know HTML!\". Don't focus too much on the reason they give to reject your application, they have to say something but they cannot always say the truth (there's no job or the company does not have enough money to hire you).\n* In my opinion, don't focus too much on the framework you use. Start to define yourself as a frontend/ backend/full-stack developer (what makes you feel better about yourself). Think about yourself as someone who resolves problems, not just someone who types code. 90% of every job is about working with other people.

I\u2019m learning now how to build MVP\u2019s using Flutter and Firebase.\n\nOver the last few years, I\u2019ve dabbled around to see what I like - JavaScript, Typescript, Erlang (for functional programming), PostgreSQL, Go, Ruby, C, Java, C#, Python, Dart, and Powershell. \n\nMy advice is to not get another degree. Instead use your business and soft skills and find problems out here and solve them. Even if it requires volunteering. \n\nBased on feedback I get from a Ruby developer meetup I attend, and from the instructors in my program. Unique projects are how you get in. Doesn\u2019t matter the language or tech stack used. \n\nMy frat brother went from a BA in Journalism and working in the Netherlands (dual citizen) to working at Google in South Carolina at a data center doing networking. He completed a network installation training program. \n\nIf you can create something from scratch and it grows to have daily active users, you are ahead of a lot of applicants. Focus on that. Screw another degree. \n\nAlso check out WIOA. They pay for approved technical programs. I\u2019m located in South Florida. \n\nGood luck \ud83c\udf40.",

I dabbled a bit with HTML web design at one of my roles 4 years ago and honestly I loved it. \nI\u2019ve been doing some very minor HTML at my roles ever since but it isn\u2019t the main premise of what I do. I personally would love to be more involved in a role that just focuses on some kind of programming. \nI\u2019m thinking of leaving the PM life as there hasn\u2019t been any growth and several cuts in the last couple years. Not to mention severe burn out. (That\u2019s a rant for another time). \n\nMy questions are, what is a good place/way to start learning a programming language and getting into the field? \n\nWill I need to obtain a certificate? \n\nI have noticed several \u201cschools\u201d and boot camps that offer certification. Are there any free resources to be self taught or would a class be more sufficient?  (Money isn\u2019t an issue but prefer not to go back to college) \n\nI do know that I\u2019ll have to create a portfolio but honestly I don\u2019t know where to begin. \nI would absolutely love any insight that isn\u2019t just a google search and having sponsored ads about what school is better. \n\nMy background: \n\u2022 bachelors in communications. \n\u2022 Google analytics certification\n\u2022 lean six sigma certified \n\u2022 PMP Certified\n\nTLDR: \nLooking for a career change, what do I need to become a SWE or web dev or sorts. I\u2019m self taught in some HTML that I was able to use in previous roles. \n\nUpdate:\n\nThank you everyone for the information! It seems that the dev jobs are roughly in the same boat as the PM jobs. PM jobs have been cut down significantly in the last 2 years and project teams have been reduced quite a bit. It\u2019s been extremely difficult finding any PM or PC work lately hence the thought of changing to a different career path. ",

If it were me now, I would not transition at this time. Im in the Bay Area and personally know of people in the tech space  that were laid off.",
            "I do have a different opinion not focused on the market. First, learn to code. If you can and you enjoy it, know that working for a paycheck doing it will drain some of the enjoyment. So, with that out of the way, look into a Computer Science degree. You may even be able to completely one fully online. If this is not an option then I would start working on a portfolio or building and launching your own apps. Regardless if you do a CS degree or not that's a good way to start.\n\nAfter that it's just a matter of getting your foot in the door. The easiest way is to join a consulting or development shop that makes websites and apps for clients. The pay is low and the demands are high but that's the easiest way to get into software development. Two years there making apps over and over for clients will give you some really solid experience. From there on the sky is the limit. You just have to always be learning new processes, technologies and keeping up to date with the industry and trends. The people complaining here saying there are no jobs are correct, but that may (or may not) change in a year or two, or more. The people here also complain because they can't easily get a job paying 150k+ a year anymore at big tech, not because they can't get a job for peanuts in a sweatshop (at least not yet) but that's where you'll need to start unless you are extremely luck and talented at the same time.\n\nMore likely than not, you'll get stuck in the first step and give up. That's usually how it goes. If you can't learn to code on your own with all the available resources out there online then this field is probably not for you. HTML is not coding and not representative of the field of software engineering but it is one thing you should know if you work on the web.",

(That\u2019s a rant for another time).\n\nCould you expand on this a bit more? Your experiences might shed insight on those wanting to do a PM job in tech. Thanks!\n\nAlso, if I were you, this is the plan that I'd follow (we are basically in similar situations):\n\n* Look into certificates on Coursera and/or Edx. Learn from here and start building a portfolio.\n\n* Similar to the above, check out theodinproject.com, freecodecamp.org, fullstackopen.com, and roadmap.sh\n\n* Study algorithms and data structures. Check out /r/leetcode and leetcode.com and start grinding right now. If you enjoy this, also check out janestreet.com/puzzles\n\n* I haven't actually looked into it myself a whole lot yet, but consider the [O'Reilly Online Learning] (https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/individuals.html) service. They have a lot of good books so it might be worth having access to all of them. \n\nAnd finally, as other's have mentioned\n\n* Consider or plan for a master's degree in CS or something related. Good options for people that can't take time off exclusively for school: UT Austin's Online Master\u2019s of Computer Science, Georgia Tech's OMSCS, Harvard Extension School Online CS (very expensive but you'll be an official Harvard alum after completing it (not a HC alum mind you)). Start by taking online community college CS classes to get accepted into UT's or GT's program(s). \n\nThe market is brutal right now. So unless you have special connections or a very impressive resume, it will be very hard to get interviews. You are already starting off disadvantaged without a CS degree. It will be even harder to get an offer after you start interviewing too. \n\nOnce you start interviewing, aim for non-remote jobs as those are less competitive. Aim for rural or non-tech centered locations. Aim for non-profits or government jobs as the competition for those jobs isn't as high compared to big tech or finance. If you have another citizenship, consider looking for work outside of the US too. \n\nGood luck!\n\nedit: added more",

We're seeing companies do 2-3x phone screens and 1-2 rounds of interviews on top of onsite gauntlets now -- not even factoring in the fact that on-sites to offer conversions have drastically dropped. Combining all of the previously mentioned, you're looking at potentially 40-50 rounds before a solid offer (4-5 companies). To rub salt in the wound, compensation has notably lowered as well as the market becomes more saturated with supply of engs, and obviously job security has plummeted.\n\nSpeaking strictly on just the interview and job hopping process, tech is rounding out to be the worst of all careers from this aspect and it's incredibly annoying.",

            "You make $175 where?\n\nMy bosses in NYC make $200K plus.\n\nWith location you can't really compare salaries.",
            "Long post incoming, feel free to ask even more questions or want me to expand on anything. I love rambling, especially to help people.\n\n**TL;DR** test the waters and see if you like it, if you like it make the switch but please please please keep your expectations within reason!\n\nFirst of all, great job on what you have accomplished so far! You are clearly smart and a hard worker so I'd say you have an aptitude for this. Between you and me, I would kill to have 175k as an accountant, it's an extremely stable career with straightforward growth whereas with cs right now we are sort of in a hyper tech bubble (though it might not pop for a while!) May I ask how chill is your day to day and if you find your self being \"bored\" (this is a plus to me lol) I would find both equally as boring too be honest since to me a job is a job and a means to live life. Programming to me gets soul-crushing after a while since it's less about being creative and more about just busting out tickets and doing what you are expected to do. Programming is something I love but the whole corporate aspect of it is something I'd never enjoy.\n\nAnother thing to note is the reality of these salaries and how competitive the field is for entry-junior level. Most people dont actually make close to 175k starting out so it might take you a little bit to reach back there. But if you can get into big tech and study your ass off for the interviews it can be possible to get there eventually especially since you live in NYC (but again this is top % of people, reddit is just it's own bubble with people who have these jobs getting upvoted the most).\n\nAll these posts you see about software being in demand they will hire anyone is actually for mid-senior levels who have experience already. The entry level market is super saturated with degrees, boot camps, and self taught people since it is a hot field at the moment. To put into perspective it took me months and hundreds and hundreds of applications after getting my degree (4.0 gpa) with internships to still land anything and some of my friends even took non-paying internships to build up experience (these are the guys who didnt do much in school though). The job market in NYC is indeed competitive but at least you wont have to deal with the lower end 60k salaries for the most part.\n\nNow going by the median for entry level and junior engineers (averages are skewd by super elite trading firms and big tech) you can still expect 80-90K all the way to 6 figures (for tech and fintech) if you put in a decent amount of work and have a solid portfolio. Even senior level medians are around 175-200K for most companies that aren't big names. Everyone is going to say im dumb and you can join amazon and google for 150K-200K+ right off the bat (this isn't a base salary but with RSU and bonus) but this is just simple statistics, only the top percentile works for these companies and that's not going to be a VAST majority of people. These interviews are both hard to get and pretty hard to pass statistically and for me personally super luck based, but certainly doable just don't expect EVERY job is like that. To explain why these interviews are hard just know that when getting a programming job you have to take a technical interview, sort of like a final exam for finals week which tests your coding skills with word problems of various difficulties. You have to set aside a good chunk of your day for these rounds, (mine was 4 hours). A lot of the time these problems require \"tricks\" and repetition to really know the pattern and know which tool to use at which times. I say it was luck based because the questions you get could be the same type of question (similar algorithm used) you crammed the night or even the hours before.\n\nI wouldn't quit my job right away til I had a decent job lead after finding out if you really do like this and want to make the switch. The main important take away is to see if YOU would like it. Make sure you actually do a deep dive and not just do basic coding 101 things and think \"this is super easy, I love this.\" Trust me every beginner coding tutorial is going to make you feel like a child can do it because the beginning is purely snytax and easy logic! Honestly, if you want I could DM some of the best textbooks (for free dont worry) to help you with the most important part of CS which is the actual algorithms portions.\n\nAs for not going back to school, you certainly don't NEED a degree in this field with enough projects and hard work but the degree itself does make it easier to get an actual interview in a sea of candidates that all decided to go into the CS major (it is the fastest growing major). Bootcamp was and can still be a decent path but it became a bit saturated where the actual certificate doesn't mean much. Some of the better known boot camps (using the HR bootcamp as an example) have gotten less and less placements over the years so I personally would try to self-study as much as you can (online resources provide just as much structure as a bootcamp these days) to see if you like it rather than dropping the $20K.\n\nIt is 100% possible to make a switch but as for if it's \"worth\" is really up to you! If you're in it for more money / challenging work you could also see which career paths you can branch out from accounting that will give you an easier time switching as well, but if you fall in love with programming it can certainly be worth to switch. The hours depend on the company but usually it can be pretty chill. As a matter of fact I would rather have a low challenge, more autopilot which is why i'd love a \"boring\" accountating job where I just grind out hours and make money while doing other stuff on the side. So when searching for companies I usually look for the ones that are \"boring\" (rest and vest) and I can chill out. But places like AMAZON will pay you a TON of money if you pass their interview but you'll end up working hard for 10-12+ hours a day if you are in AWS. The reason people pick AMAZON over something like lets say GOOGLE is faster promotion (google seems to low ball your skill level to get you a lower pay if you're mid-senior level), and AMAZON hires (and fires) more people yearly compared to the other FAANGs so you'll see people who didn't get into one of the others go there."

Obviously ML Ops is huge, and anyone with good AI LLM experience is going to do well. I\u2019m experienced with neural network quantization and I have multiple offers for jobs atm, because it\u2019s so niche. You kind of have to know the market though, and develop experience and interesting projects in those niches. Niches I think are big right now are (only in ML, since that\u2019s my speciality):\n- ML Ops\n- LLMs (very competitive though, a lot of hype)\n- Compiler engineers \n- Quantization \n\nBut I\u2019m sure there are other niches elsewhere.\n\nI\u2019ve found that in the current job market, especially as an early career professional, recruiters are kind of a waste of time unless they\u2019re in house to the company. I\u2019ve been in contact with a dozen recruiters and nothing has come of it. The roles I reached out to directly had a much higher chance of going forward for less efffort.\n\nI also think the OpenSource route for getting a job is underused. Find a company you might want to work for and which has OpenSource code, e.g. on GitHub, and start contributing. There\u2019s a decent chance they\u2019ll offer you a paid role if you do a good job! I found one OpenSource library I wanted to contribute to because it would have been a good learning opportunity for me tk understand how to build a similar code base, and I\u2019d chat with one of the guys in LinkedIn, and after I\u2019d submitted 2 PRs he asked me if I\u2019d be interested in a job. It makes sense: they want to hire, but don\u2019t want to post a role and get 100 unqualified candidates bombarding them. Meanwhile there\u2019s a guy who went out of his way to help them out with their work for free, can obviously do the work and can navigate the code base, and ideally has decent online communication skills. Why would you not offer that person the job?\n\nIn my job hunt, I followed this recent freeCodeCamp video on getting a job, I think it had a lot of really good advance that is definitely worth following, geared towards people who are looking for their first job in software development. Highly, highly recommend, from working on projects to optimising CV and GitHub profile: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6nz8GXjxiHg\n\nI also started making YouTube videos about my niche: it shows I have people skills, I put effort into giving big back, and I know my area.

            "** Passers-by should read the comments under this one. Good discussion.\n\n*** A lot of people are mentioning that Trilogy stinks. Honestly, you can find such opinions/warnings about literally every bootcamp. They are as numerous as the bootcamps themselves.\n\nJust my experiences after doing this for ~10 years, and finding myself in a management role. They're not gospel.\n\n> At this point my goals are working from home, 9-5, Monday - Friday, no weekends, no holidays.\n\nThis is not an unreasonable ask, in my experience.\n\n> With the pandemic I know many people went from office workers, to work at home. Is this likely to continue? Or is there a large push to return to the office?\n\nThere is a large push from corporate leadership for \"return to office\". I don't have a crystal ball, but I'd bet on the companies that are pushing for \"return to office\" getting their way. Companies that were remote-first before the pandemic will probably remain remote-first.\n\nAny position that is fully remote is going to be ***incredibly*** competitive compared to any given on-site position. You will be competing with the best of the best for many of those spots.\n\n> Are the hours consistent yet flexible?\n\nThat's going to depend on specific corporate cultures.\n\nI get to be pretty flexible with my team. Peers/friends at other orgs, not so much.\n\n>  I\u2019ve read people often times work early or late based on their own discretion.\n\nI would not use \"often\" to qualify that arrangement. Most companies are going to have \"core hours\" during which all of the synchronous work (alignment/planning meetings, pairing, etc) happens.\n\n> How many hours a week is normal?\n\nSome figure less than or equal to 40. \n\n> Or is there a lot of forced overtime?\n\nOvertime isn't usually a thing in typical product development focused teams. [SRE](https://sre.google/)/DevOps/Ops flavored roles can involve on-call rotations. I rarely hear about anything as nuts as the 70-80 hour weeks I hear about in bedside care. Those sort of \"sky is falling, all hands on deck\" incidents happen maybe once per year at my company. YMMV.\n\n> How important are the degrees and certifications in this industry?\n\nBootcamps can be a viable alternative to those lacking in the time or money to pursue an undergraduate program. I cannot provide you a list of \"the good ones\" -- bootcamps are not accredited, very wild-west. If you have an existing relationship with a college/university that offers a [Trilogy](https://www.trilogyed.com/) based program, those are generally OK but come at a premium. They are absolutely not a replacement for an undergraduate program. \n\nThere are some companies, particularly those who pay top dollar, who will not give you the time of day without a completed CS/related undergraduate degree.",
            "It\u2019s doable for anyone with the tenacity to try. \n\nThere are a few things to consider before making this decision. Namely, the entry level market is flooded. Whether new grads, bootcampers, or self taught devs, getting your first gig will not be easy. Your best chances are at a place that has poor reviews and churns through developers (a \u2018beggars can\u2019t be choosers\u2019 mentality will go a long way). Then, stay long enough to get experience that will bolster your job search and income. In 3.5 years I tripled my initial salary. Also, because the market is nuts, remote jobs will likely be harder for you  to come by. You have to be realistic, Will a company hire you with no experience or someone else you has moderate experience for the same amount?\n\nAnother caveat that I\u2019ve recently discovered is that while a lot of places are now offering remote positions, if you\u2019re in a HCOL (which is the case for me), remote companies will pay what is relative to their market. For me that\u2019s a 40k discrepancy. \n\nIn regards to hours, the places that I\u2019ve been at have a general \u201cbusiness hours\u201d but my direct managers have been flexible with my schedule. One gig allowed me to work from 6-2, which helped me beat the DC rush hour. Getting up at 5 was worth the 4 extra hours in the afternoon that I got to spend with my family. \n\nAs for degree, bootcamp, or other, I\u2019m self taught. I would love to go back to school and get the brick and mortar stuff, but it\u2019s difficult to find the time and now that I\u2019ve been in the field for almost 4 years, it isn\u2019t really necessary. Though I didn\u2019t have much flexibility in the path that I chose; I left a job and was out of work. A degree was too expensive and would take too long and a bootcamp was also too expensive for me. In total I spent less than 2k to teach myself enough to get my first job and that included 1100 for a new computer. The longer you wait, the more crowded the market will become. The most important thing you can do is start coding and learning and see if it\u2019s what you want to do before you make the life changing decision to change careers.",
            "It's viable. 9-6 is more common. You may have on call as well, but nothing remotely as intense as nursing at a hospital. I've never been a nurse. I just had the misfortune of needing them for a couple years. The ones treating me were at the top of the profession and make less than I do. A software job is much much easier IMO.\n\nMy recommendation if you have a bachelor's is to do OMSCS at Georgia Tech. A nurse likely wouldn't need leveling to qualify. You should obviously do some online learning to code courses, but you will have time before they admit you to do that. It's cheap, online, flexible and legit.",

            "My mom was an RN - she worked in as a nurse consultant for insurance companies on complex claims and really only ever worked those hours. She would also frequently show up late and take a lot of days off work. Before embarking on a whole new field - you may also want to consider going that route. My mom got a work from home job doing that in 2001, though it didn't last for very long and she didn't really enjoy it that kind of thing is possible within the nursing field. \n\nIf you really want to do something entirely different, by all means, but I am still struggling after 2 years to really break into the software dev career as a former chemist so it really isn't an easy road even with a strong work ethic and STEM background- especially if your goal is wfh and regular hours you would  have an easier time finding that within your own field.",

            "I\u2019m a RN learning the MERN stack right now with the help of my fiance who is a SWE. Therefore, I don't have any advice as far as whether a degree vs bootcamp is better. But I just want to say I so resonate with the burnout in nursing. \n\nI know a lot of people here are saying \"the money is good!\" Or \" go travel nursing!\" But I TOTALLY understand where you are coming from. \n\nI've been a nurse for 6 years and I'm done with caring for the general public. Nursing is a damn hard job that some people (like myself) are not cut out for in the long run. I can't fathom doing this for another 30+ years. Covid is the cherry on top, when I got deployed last year to night shift covid ICU for 3 months, ratios were 1:3 or 1:4 in the icu, and management was canceling scheduled staff vacations. Oh and can't forget about the 1% raise and two tier pay system they tried to enforce on us this year, which we fought against and won (Thank God for unions). \n\nPeople who are not nurses don't and won't understand. For me, I even feel shame in calling in sick and refusing to work overtime. Even executing my exit plan to leave this career is making me feel guilty. I feel shame for getting annoyed by my patients who are so difficult to deal with (addicts, entitlement, demanding, verbally abusive, you know the rest..). As a nurse you see the best and worst in people. The worst rubbed off on me and I would carry that negative energy home. That's how much this job rubbed off on me. Again, this is case by case. Not every nurse is like me. Maybe I just need to not take it personally and grow some balls.\n\nThat's my personal experience with nursing. And there are days when I have really great patients. I realize that I have one life to live and that I want to have a career that allows me to urinate when I want to, work from home, have a full hour of lunch, have autonomy, be creative and heck, use my PTO that I earned! Anyhoo, enough of the negativity :). I'm enjoying learning about algorithms, data structures and specifically javascript for now. Hope whichever direction you take, you at least won't have any regrets not trying!",
            "If you have the time/money I recommend a bachelors over a bootcamp. Bachelors will give you the opportunity to get internships which make getting a full time job incredibly easier as well as build your confidence with software development. Second, taking the time to learn the fundamentals is important but it also sounds like it will give you a break from the nursing burnout, where as a bootcamp is incredibly fast paced and stressful and doesn\u2019t offer as much depth. Further, universities will open up feeder pipelines into big companies that hire lots of students from them, which is a pretty smooth transition into a first job. \n\nA lot of people are only focusing on money but aren\u2019t considering the cost of your mental health. Does traveling nursing make a lot more? Sure, but is it sustainable? You can make as much as you do as a traveling nurse as an SWE around mid-career if you are reasonably driven. It\u2019s not as if the entry level salaries at around 80k a year will leave you destitute. If nursing was your passion there are plenty of biotech and medical companies that would love to have someone with your background so you may even be able to skip right over the entry level pay bands. \n\nSide note: avoid hospital SWE jobs as they pay very poorly for some reason, I never understood how places like Cardinal Health have so much money but pay developers terribly.",

On-call rotations are also common among many companies. But you can find a company or position that will not have on call or crunch time.\n\n>  Is this likely to continue? Or is there a large push to return to the office?\n\nThere is a large push to return to the office. Remote work is still significantly more common but there is a large push to return to the office. Pointless mid-level micromanaging terrors hate remote work. Lots of jobs are being listed as remote but are not actually remote.\n\n> Are the hours consistent yet flexible?\n\nVaries wildly. Crunch time around release is common. On-call (usually via rotation) is also common. Some companies are much, much better about WLB than others.

Would you recommend one or the other?\n\nThey're not that important, but significantly more important than the nursing world. There's a lot to say about this topic... I highly suggest searching.\n\nThe grass isn't always greener on the other side. My wife is doing travel nursing now and making big bucks. Plus she has quite a lot of flexibility in her schedule.

I\u2019ve also actually found WFH to be more productive for me and have had no issue getting to know my coworkers online.

With the pandemic I know many people went from office workers, to work at home. Is this likely to continue? Or is there a large push to return to the office?\n\nA lot of this will depend on your company/industry. Some areas will be a bit more laid back. Perhaps places like government, non-profits. I assume non-profits don't pay as well, but perhaps you care more about **who** you work for vs other things like compensation. I've spent a lot of time in agency/consulting, and those types of companies can have pretty large spikes in hours. Things like poor planning, unexpected issues (think about some of the bug/exploits you hear about in the news, you might be responsible for patching Production and then going back to your original work). What happens if Production crashes? Depending the severity and your role, you might be spending a lot of hours trying to restore things. Probably the two biggest things that cause people to freak out is lives at stake and money. I'll let you decide which is more important, but there's definitely people that will vote the latter. Other companies, outside of emergencies, will be a lot more reasonable with expectations. You'll just have to see or research (and ask questions during interviews). My current job has been generally pretty laid back even thought it's consulting. It's primarily due to the client and the scope of work. I probably had 2-3 days since October where I worked really late into the night, but some of that was by choice.\n\nFor working at home, I think there will be considerably more full-time remote positions than there were pre-pandemic. A lot of companies are considering doing some type of hybrid approach whenever the pandemic ends. This might mean 2-3 days a week in the office. The truth is, no one really knows right now. Everyone is different. Some people love this. I've changed jobs twice during the pandemic, and full remote has made learning about a new company a lot harder. I mostly only know people on my project team, and I hardly got to know any senior and mid-level management. You don't get the incidental contact you used to. Some people are fine with this. I don't miss my commute, but it's definitely more isolating than it used to be, and I think career progression will be harder if you are fully remote. Some of that will depend on your company/team culture, though. I spent an hour speaking to a new person on our team, go over a the codebase on a video conference today. I spent another hour speaking to another engineer on the team, talking about some potential design/architecture options. I really enjoyed that, because most days, I've only been talking to people 15 minutes during a daily status meeting. Again, this will vary a lot from company-to-company, project-to-project.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Regarding pursuing this objective, I\u2019ve seen various discussions about university vs bootcamps. How important are the degrees and certifications in this industry? Would you recommend one or the other?\n\nIf you can afford it, my assumption is that a university program will teach you more. There are 1-2 year programs, I believe. One thing that really draws people to this industry, though, is the low barrier to entry. There are plenty of people who are self-taught or took a bootcamp. Entry level seems to be pretty competitive, though, as there are a lot of people looking to break into the industry these days.\n\nYour actual degree doesn't matter that much. In some cases, some companies will have an HR department that might filter you out if you don't have a degree, but once you're actually working, most people won't care. In general, I think people say certifications don't matter. The one exception I've been seeing (and some people have disagreed with me recently on this) are some of the cloud certifications. A lot of companies are pushing their employees to get these lately. For consulting companies, the more employees they have certified, they can get improved status with the vendor, and that can leads to projects.\n\nIt's a good field, there have been some bumps along the way. When covid first hit, some companies got hit \\***really**\\* hard, and there were actually websites tracking layoffs/furloughs. If you were asking this question in August 2020, a lot of people would probably say they really weren't sure what was going to happen. It rebounded very strongly, and most people feel pretty comfortable with things these days. \n\nGood luck, it's always scary (exciting?) trying something new. I hope you find something that works for you, even if it's not programming. Feel free to ask more questions if you have them.",
            "2.5 YOE here but talk a lot with friends at other companies and am pretty in touch with industry.\n\n\nI would say most work 45 hrs or less including myself (40 or less for me)\n\nThere are a ton of remote jobs now. It's honestly moving towards the norm since it cuts a lot of costs.\n\nRarely weekends except an occasional here and there.\n\nDegree is not really important for most positions and neither are certifications.\n\nProjects to put on your resume (and initially grades) will get you interviews. Talking well about those projects (design decisions, root cause analysis of defects, etc) and doing well in the technical interviews will get you offers. Although there are jobs where technical interviews are not very demanding so I wouldn't fret, you can initially shoot for those jobs, they still pay well, just not as well as the ones that wreck you during the interviews.\n\nFor a 35 year old that probably wants to expedite things I wouldn't do a bachelors. It's also important to provide how much CS or programming experience you have. Assuming you have none, I would\n\n1) self study a course or a couple . Let's say CS50 online + web developer boot camp in Udemy by colt steele\n\n2) after doing those, I would then think about the bootcamo\n\nThe reason is because you may not like it, and even if you do, a boot camp pace is way too fast to get a ton out of it with little prior experience. Taking those two courses before hand will make it more worthwhile.\n\nI personally wouldn't spend 4 years on a degree unless you can get it in 2 years due to previous BS. Then it starts becoming a competing option",

Most jobs have at least a partial on-call component\n2. If you're new you're going to get stuck playing catch-up after-hours.  This will slow down if you're with it for a while, but you'll be starting from the beginning.\n\nIf you think you'd like programming, by all means, go ahead, but expect there to be some level of grind there.  Probably not as extreme as what you're used to but I'm not sure about reaching your stated goal.",

        "content": "I'm 42 and have been in the internal audit profession for 15 years.  I left my job without anything else lined up because they would no longer allow me to work remotely (I moved from California to Austin, Tx during the pandemic).  But for various reasons, I want to leave that profession behind and start something new, like learning to code. Changing careers is very high risk and scary (going into the unknown and starting from scratch) but I feel that coding is in such high demand I'm bound to find something.  Some factors to consider:\n\n1. I'm currently not working, so I have the time to learn.  I could invest 1 year into learning and finding a job.  I can afford this time off because I have savings. But I do need a land a job by the end of 2022, hopefully sooner.\n2. Obviously I know I will start at junior/entry level with much less pay than I'm used to.  I am hoping for 60-80K range with potential to go into 100-200K within 5-10 years (I don't really know these are just numbers I'm thinking). Being 42, I'm hoping I have around 10-15 years left in my working career.\n3. I don't want to go back to school.  I already have an MBA and CPA.  A CS degree is out of the question, considering cost and my age.  I would be open to a bootcamp if it is worth it.\n4. I currently live in Austin, but I plan to move to Houston because I have a lot of family there and  lower cost of living.  I would either like to find a job in Houston or find a remote job anywhere in the country.  I know Austin is a tech hub with possibly greater career opportunities and startups than Houston, but I have read that Houston has more tech jobs than Austin although focused more on the energy sector.\n5. I plan to determine whether I have an aptitude for coding by taking free courses over the next few weeks such as [https://www.freecodecamp.org/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).  As I said, I would be open to a bootcamp if it is worth it.  If I discover I like it and have an aptitude for it, then my plan is to move to Houston and start studying on my own (maybe do a bootcamp if it makes sense), and hopefully land a job within 6-12 months. If I don't have an aptitude, then I may just give up on this idea and starting finding a job in my old profession.\n6. I'm thinking to learn web development, front and back end.  I've heard that Ruby on Rails is a good language.  I have heard to learn a language I have an aptitude in, not just based on the demand. I expect that I would need to learn several languages though to be competitive.\n7. I feel I would have an aptitude for it because of my working and personality style appears to fit: I'm highly analytical and work well independently, cautious, systematic accurate.  I've been told by my boss that I'd be a good specialist and I'm a great individual contributor.  If you have heard of DISC profile, I am a \"C\" which is \"the Analyst\".  I'm also an INTJ.  I also bring to the table soft skills and management skills acquired from my professional career.\n\nI guess my question is if my plan above is decent, what assumptions do I have wrong, what am I missing/if there other things I should know or consider?

I\u2019ve been promoted since conversion because I am good at my job and a valuable member of the team. Maturity translates to better people skills than some young folks have. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to invest the time to learn coding well enough to do software engineering (and it\u2019s something that does take time), look at other tech roles that might be a good match for your skill set and experience: product management, product owner, scrum master, customer success, etc.\n\nETA: There\u2019s more to software engineering than just slinging code and the higher paid roles tend to be for quality engineers who can build a solid system and lead a team in a productive direction.",
            "I think you're a very strong candidate for career change, I don't know why the other responses are so negative. Your MBA, CPA, and 15 years of work experience are huge advantages that will rocket your career progression after you get your first job, and overwhelm your slight age disadvantage. The average bootcamp attendee has just an unrelated BA and 5 years of unrelated experience in their 30s, so you'll have a huge head start: https://www.coursereport.com/reports/coding-bootcamp-job-placement-report-2019. Yes, the entry-level market is tough currently, but you're living in the best entry-level market in USA right now.\n\nI think you have the right idea to get started. Target web dev, because it's the most friendly field for career changers. Take 3 months to dabble in free online resources like Freecodecamp: https://www.freecodecamp.org/, Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/, and OSSU: https://github.com/ossu/computer-science to gauge whether it makes sense for you invest into a career change. \n\nIf you decide to green-light your career change, then spend the next 6 months learning fundamentals. Enroll in a 6 month part time bootcamp to learn web dev and network. Spend the other half of your time self-learning data structures and algorithms, and grind Leetcode to prepare for technical interviews. You should just focus on Javascript for web dev and Python for technical interviews. It's better to be strong at Javascript and have no experience with Ruby, instead of being mediocre at both Javascript and Ruby. But if you really want to learn Ruby, then Odin Project has a Ruby track.\n\nIn any case, allocate the final 3 months for full time job search, relocation, and delay before the job starts, and you'll be set. Bootcamp grads need to hustle for job interviews more than people with STEM degrees, and bootcamp grads need to tolerate more rejection than people with STEM degrees. But at the end of the day everybody can get a job. Only about 50% of software engineers have CS degrees, and about 20% have some other kind of STEM degree. The remaining 30% is a combination of bootcamp grads and self-learners. Data here: https://hired.com/state-of-software-engineers\n\nThe main thing to be cautious about is that it might take more than 3 months to find a job. 3 months is just the average it takes a bootcamp grad to find a job, and bootcamps often pad their employment rates by offering temporary employment to graduates that take longer to find jobs. Sometimes it takes bootcamp grads 3-6 months to find a job, depending upon how picky they are about location.",

There are people who have been professional programmers for 25 years who are making 110k and will never make more than 110k.  *shrug*  There are people who can make 200k after three years experience without a college degree. \n\nThere is no easy path to go from 60k-200k, it's all talent, hard work, and a little bit of luck.

Went to bootcamp in late twenties/early 30s? Got a low paying web development job.  Got promoted.  Did that for ~4 years, got hired at a well known game company for six figures. \n\n\nAlso look at programming adjacent jobs.

If we assume you made $100k in your highest earning year, if you take a year off work to learn programming and it takes five years to get back to $100k (we'll say you make $70k on average as an entry level programmer without a CS degree), that's (($100k - $70k) x 5 years + $100k x 1 year) = $250k in opportunity cost. \n\nIf you have ten years left in your career after that, $250k/10 years = $25k. So you'd basically have to earn $125k/year, on average, over the final ten years of your career, to break even. That doesn't count potential bootcamp costs either.

For the past decade I\u2019ve been working in construction, project management and eventually running a small company. I spent ~16 months learning programming and eventually built a small portfolio of personal projects. \n\nMy job hunt was a bit arduous.

With that said, I expect that I can ramp back up quickly\u2026my goal being to get back over 6 figures in about year-and-a-half. To help me with this goal, I am enrolled in an online university to earn a CS degree (WGU), while I also continue to get professional experience and grow as a developer. \n\nI feel fortunate to have found a job in this field and be transitioning careers at this stage of my life. I\u2019m currently on a hybrid work schedule, but I enjoy getting in-office a couple days a week to get in-person experience from more senior developers. My role has potential to become 100% WFH whenever I feel comfortable doing that.

Don\u2019t get discouraged, just do it. Your initial plan of action is fine, but it will evolve as you start figuring out what you like. I\u2019m a fan of freeCodeCamp, and earned a few of their certificates along my path. Also Harvard\u2019s free cs50 course is a great place to start as well. My goal was initially to get into data manipulation, so I started learning Python and R.

People can feel pressure that's not actually there (or sometimes it is there) to work long hours. Instead of establishing clear, professional boundaries and sticking to a 40 hour work week, they give in to the pressure and work long hours. Taking a gap year, or changing companies, or leaving SWE entirely *doesn't fix that.* You've already acquired that bad habit, and it's only a matter of time before it rears its ugly head again wherever you go.\n\nSo instead of taking the nuclear approach of a gap year, or leaving SWE entirely, you should focus on trying to fix the root problem, whatever that may be. Start establishing clear boundaries. Work 40 hours a week.\n\nThat's just one example, but for all of the other BS I listed and others I didn't, you can find teams/companies that have good healthy working environments. They exist. You just need to make it a point to find them by asking good questions during the reverse interview process, and declining companies that give you bad vibes.\n\nOr if you truly just hate coding now, then ignore the above. Maybe look into PM, that's a parallel career track that a CS degree qualifies you for and doesn't have coding. But be warned, being a PM does carry with it all the ugly baggage that SWE does. You can end up in toxic environments, with long hours, prod fires, annoying team members, bad bosses, tight deadlines, etc.",

I ended up quitting and started a small pizza shop - but it\u2019s been very hard and I\u2019ve burned through a lot of money trying to get it off the ground.\n\nIf you hate coding, or just office life in general, I think it\u2019s worth it to spend some time now vs later making sure your taking the steps to get your life to where you want it. But if you just want a job that pays the same and is less work or stress - I don\u2019t think you can do better than keeping a career your already good at. It\u2019s a tremendous amount of effort to change the course your on in life - just make sure your doing it for the right reasons - cause if it\u2019s just for money and \u2018less stress\u2019 your going to have to go through a *very* deep valley to emerge on the other side, and if you don\u2019t hate what you were doing with every ounce of your being, it\u2019s going to be real tempting after a few months of working in an unfamiliar environment and having to learn from scratch while getting paid 50% or less for what is in all likelihood an objectively harder job to go back to that comfort and security.\n\nAt the same time - if you really are unhappy with what your doing, and your not taking pride in your work, or the things it enables you to do with your spare time - I really don\u2019t think you have any other options but to go through that valley, even if you don\u2019t know where it leads, and you know ahead of time it\u2019s going to be a hard journey.\n\n\nEdit:\nA lot of people I know who didn\u2019t go to college seem to be doing alright working in logistics. I think you may be able to make in the range of $20/hr - which sounds terrible coming from a salary position. But that\u2019s $20/hr for 40 hrs a week. You can hit it hard around the holidays and coast.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got some money saved up, trade school like welding or mechanic and the time to complete the certifications could also get you to a decent life without the office environment. \n\n\nIf your personable servers and bartenders make decent money as well. \n\n\nBut those are the common sorts of job I\u2019m aware of  if you wanted to make decent money without going the college route. \n\n\nIf you just don\u2019t like coding but your fine with the office and all that comes with it - just switch over to a PM type roll. Just knowing what the different tech is, how it plugs in, what it can do, common fault points, ect you\u2019ll be way better than a lot of the non technical PM\u2019s I\u2019ve had.

            "I eventually decided to retire, basically down to burnout, after being at the same position for around 10 years (14 years with the company).  The company was still pretty good, the position was still pretty good, but due to a number of external factors, I had become super stale and was unable to effectively manage that.\n\nI did manage over 25 years, much of it filled with pretty high-end work.  Looking back on it, I think the biggest take-home would be to make small but impactful jumps before you get pushed to the edge and feel like you have no choices.  I cruised past a number of people who really burned the candle at both ends, burned out into the dotcom bust, moved back to their Midwestern college town and had to chill for three or four years before re-engaging with development.  There were very few cases where I saw the employee (or the employer) benefit from that extreme level of commitment - successful products sure take enough skill, but luck is HUGE, so just holding steady at 150% effort for a long time seldom works.\n\nIf I graphed my burned over time, my biggest points of relief were when jumping ship and taking a new job.  It provides a level of artificial challenge plus a lot of set decisions, so for six months to a year you generate a series of accomplishable goals.  Then you reach your high-productivity plateau, which can also be quite satisfying for a year or two.  After that, you start to accumulate HARD PROBLEMS, at which point a sideways change can be valuable, since endlessly dealing with insoluble problems is wearing.  Or sometimes after 2-3 years, you realize that the company or position doesn't have a strong future, which is also wearing.  Often you can lump all of that under \"politics\", because you've reached a point where you're not having to solve the problems presented, you're having to rephrase the problems to be sensible.\n\nAnother approach is to get a strong outside hobby, something that forces you to dial down your hours.  Training for a marathon or triathlon is popular, as is learning to fly a plane.  I've seen this with multiple people (and myself).  How I believe it works is a combination of a challenging new project with lots of early wins (same as switching up positions), plus narrowing your time spent at work on any given day, which lends focus.  In terms of burnout (or RSI, for that matter), you do most of the damage in the last hours of the day, not the first hours of the day.  When you're sitting at the computer at 10pm trying to land one more change, you are tired and useless, so you're both more prone to errors AND you feel under the gun.",
            "I thought I was burned out around that time too. It wasn't because of coding. It was because of the companies I was writing code for.   \n    \nEngineers need room to explore, do creative problem solving, learn new exciting things. Problem is that a lot if companies just want you to pump out widgets. I switched from FE to IaC because it was a new field and relatively untapped. Poof, burnout gone.  \n   \nBest advice I have is go into starvation mode and start socking away money. Try to get a 3-6mo war chest. Casually start looking for jobs but VETT THEM HARDCORE on the working environment, tech stack, philosophies of SWE. Really think about the type of work you want to do and how you want your career to grow based on those preferences.\n    \nonce you have a war chest, you'll not be as afraid to to just quit your job on good terms to look for another one (if you havent found one already). Be honest in your reasoning for leaving (long hours, lack of planning, toxic behavior, etc) without throwing anybody under the bus. If you tell them you are quitting with no other job lined up they might try hard to keep you on by addressing the issues or giving you a pay bump.  \n   \nSWE have a really bad habit of just taking any job that will have them or get in a rut bouncing from one bad gig to a worse one. You have to develop the power to say NO. That's the only way to get agency in your own career and overall happiness.",

            "> I cry every night before sleep very loud and very long.\n\nUhhhh... yes. Possibly severe, severe depression. Or a neurochemical imbalance. \n\nAnecdotes: A friend of mine was getting put on \"performance improvement plans\" and such while dealing with suicidal ideations. \n\nEnded up letting her work know about the depression, and then went into a mental hospital. Came out of the mental hospital a few days later (because they weren't that helpful) and started going through treatment known as transcranial magnetic stimulation, which can leave you a bit foggy or less functional during it.\n\nSo she was less functional *while at work,* while on a 'performance improvement plan'. But they also knew she was trying to fix what she was going through.\n\nThe TMS treatment worked, thank fuck, and a while later she ended up getting some sort of 'best employee' recognition thing?\n\nYou *can* turn this around, but it's going to be slow going, you're going to need to go get actual medical diagnoses, and you're going to need to go through the effort of (possibly multiple kinds of) medication (before they find the right one) *and* therapy to turn things around.\n\nGo. Consult medical professionals now. Like, now now. Find your phone, pick it up, and call some places, ask questions. \n\n(Second anecdote: Said friend is now trying to get off the anti-depressants. Turns out that taking these meds for years can mean taking years to come off of them, but they aimed for doing it in a few weeks on their first attempt, because that's all that was tested during the FDA trials. And one withdrawal side effect is crying. Not sadness. Not depression. Just... the inescapable desire to cry for no reason. Emotionally she was \"fine\", if a bit tired from what her body/brain were going through. And they ended up having to try and taper her down through a different drug. But she would spend hours a day crying because of the neurochemical imbalance.)",
            "Okay dude. Take a step back. You\u2019ve committed to nothing and you\u2019re only going to have a meeting. Go to that meeting but mostly listen, say you are worried about burnout and stress, but don\u2019t mention any mental health stuff. Ask to take a week off to address some personal issues in your life and get some rest, and say something like you feel this will help you be the best employee you can, which is true. This will free up your schedule to figure out a treatment plan and read into your options.\n\nThen, schedule a doctors appoint and ask about treatment for your symptoms and maybe get a diagnosis. Tell them everything and be 100% honest. The right to take leave from work exists explicitly for treatment of mental health conditions or the inability to do work because of a recognized diagnosis, but you need to be working with a doctor to really qualify. Burnout alone does not count.\n\nThere are options for time off, FMLA, and short and long term disability. Workers comp might apply here as well. However, you need to be reaching out for help, and sort of need to be working the system to take time off and get paid for it. That means seeing a doctor and getting a diagnosis, and start getting treated.\n\nEdit: just credit for asking for help. I think you\u2019re over thinking this a bit, and worried about the worse case. The best case here, is that your life turns around and you get back to enjoying what you love. That\u2019s worth more than anything, and from what you\u2019ve said about the situation this doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re going to be ambushed.",

When they \"protect the company\" from is lawsuits, discrimination cases, etc. They don't typically protect Bob the lower-middle manager from things.

A week here, 2 days there, a 3 or 4 day weekend when I wanted to.  I must have taken 2 months off in 4 month period.  It helped immensely.\n\nI hope your managers are willing to work with you like that.  If they aren't, then that sucks but they should fully expect that you will quit.

Maybe you see idiots failing up while you get no credit for the great work you do)\n\nIdentifying a more fine-grained cause will be helpful in figuring out a real solution... Otherwise you might take a two week vacation to \"recover\" and find nothing's changed when you get back.  (And you'll notice that some of those causes will be unfixable, as they're the result of corporate policy or culture.  If that's the case for you, be looking for a job somewhere better suited to your mental health).\n\nRemember this:  Burnout is a workplace injury.  You need to be just as patient with yourself as you would be in the event a forklift ran you over and broke your leg.  It's going to take time to heal.  And just because it's an \"invisible\" injury doesn't make it any less legitimate... you shouldn't try to \"tough it out\".  Seek help where you can and give yourself some grace.\n\nIf you were stacking boxes in a warehouse and threw your back out, there'd be all kinds of legally mandated support in terms of insurance and worker's comp.

        "content": "After 7 bumpy years in software development, I've had enough. It's such a soul sucking stressful job with no end in sight. The grinding, the hours behind the screen, the constant pressure to deliver. Its just too much. I'm not quitting now but I've put a plan to move away from software here's why:\n\n1- **Average Pay:** Unfortunatly the pay was not worth all the stress that you have to go through, It's not a job where you finish at 5 and clock out. Most of the time I had to work weekends and after work hours to deliver tasks\n\n2- **The change of pace in technology**: My GOD this is so annoying every year, they come up with newer stuff that you have to learn and relearn and you see those requirements added to job descriptions. One minute its digital transformation, the other is crypto now Its AI. Give me a break\n\n3- **The local competition**: Its so competitive locally, If you want to work in a good company in a country no matter where you are, you will always be faced with fierce competition and extensive coding assignements that are for the most part BS\n\n4-  **Offshoring:** This one is so bad. Offshoring ruined it for me good, cause jobs are exported to cheaper countries and your chances for better salary are slim cause businesses will find ways to curb this expense.\n\n5- **Age:** As you age, 35-50 yo: I can't imagine myself still coding while fresher graduates will be literally doing almost the same work as me. I know I should be doing management at that point. So It's not a long term career where you flourish, this career gets deprecated reallly quickly as you age.\n\n6- **Legacy Code:** I hate working in Legacy code and every company I've worked with I had to drown in sorrows because of it.\n\n7- **Technical Interviews:** Everytime i have to review boring technical questions like OOP, solid principles, system design, algorithms to eventually work on the company's legacy code. smh.\n\nI can yap and yap how a career in software development is short lived and soul crushing. So I made the executive descision to go back to school to get my degree in management, and take on a management role. I'm craving some kind of stability where as I age I'm confident that my skills will still be relevant and not deprecated, even if that means I won't be paid much.\n\nThe problem is that I want to live my life, I don't want to spend it working my ass off, trying to fight of competition, technical debt, skill depreciation, devalution etc... I just want a dumb job where I do the work and go back home sit on my ass and watch some series...\n\n**EDIT 1: I come from a 3rd world country Lebanon. I'm not from the US or Europe to have the chance to work on heavily funded projects or get paid a fair salary. MY MISTAKE FOR SHITTING ON THE PROFESSION LOL**.\n\n**EDIT 2: Apparently US devs CANNOT relate to this, while  a lot of non-western folks are relating...Maybe the grass is greener in the US.. lolz**.\n\n**EDIT 3: Im in Canada right now and It's BRUTAL, the job market is even worse than in Lebanon, I can barely land an interview here, TABARNAC!**.\n\n**EDIT 4: Yall are saying skill issue, this is why i quit SWE too many sweats** \ud83d\udc80",

Middle management is a basically a shit sandwich between your reports who don't want to do shit and don't know how, and execs that only want more. You're entire day is having your attention subverted to deal with requests and problems, so many that you don't have time to do it all.\n\nAt the very least, try to go into something like product management. You do have to manage things, the MBA will help, and it doesn't have the downsides of you having to learn new technology. Also, you can use your previous experience as a SWE so you aren't starting at the bottom.",

I once worked at a small startup in which I related with the points in the post, eventually I had to realize the company wasn't a great place to work, so I made up my mind to search for something else and then left.\n\nThe options that are at your reach play a pretty important role on how you view this industry. If you live in the US/Europe then it can be as easy as spending a couple hours at LinkedIn, applying for a couple roles and then maybe you can land a new good paying position within a month or so, but it's not as easy for everyone everywhere.\n\nDo what sits right for you OP, I'm sure as hell I wouldn't be able to live in those conditions and that's how I felt when I worked at that shitty company I mentioned before.

I\u2019ve noticed a lot of education hasn\u2019t done a good job of showing how to be flexible. Some schools only use primary languages and decades old product.\n\nI know I only knew how to use Flask, but then I was exposed to Angular and React- something that saved my career because they made things click whereas Flask just kind of was a painting by numbers.\n\nThe ONLY way some people are exposed is by being forced into them. Then something clicks. \n\nI felt like such a loser for half of my career because I was a legacy developer, working on cobal and mainframes. My education prepared me for 1/20th of my career because actual paradigms have shifted from functional, to oo, to event based.\n\nTake a deep breath. Ask someone you trust at your workplace how long they took to acclimate. It may be a shop issue- if they are spreading their stacks all over the place and requiring too much from each developer. That\u2019s just shitty team structure.\n\nScrew the guys saying it\u2019s a skills problem. Maybe grit, but there are tons of other factors and you don\u2019t need to feel gaslit. We all do it.\n\nI went from Cobol on a mainframe to working on the Cardano chain and full stack. You tell me any other professions that need to be that flexible.",

Incompetant management\n2. Imcompetant HRs\n3. Extreme greed for money\n\nAlso, I am beginning to think that it is not just the career in tech. **It is just job as a whole.** The entire world is becoming so capitalistic that even the founders, who had once, a vision, just want free money out of nowhere, and their entire actions are based on how to squeeze money from EVERY SINGLE PERSON AROUND.",
            "You are 100% correct in your assessment.  Reddit is full of overprivileged children of the upper class that while I'm not saying they were \"given\" something they mostly slept-walked their way to secure non-exploitive high paying jobs.  \n\nI'm on the same boat as you.  I don't have contacts that go back a generation or more anywhere.  I'm in line with everyone else in the world for the worst most exploited positions.  It sucks.  I've literally had US friends tell me to \"just ask my parents for money\" or when I say I don't have that they say \"Then your grandparents, you know what I mean\".  Umm no I don't know what you mean there is literally no one in the world I can ask for free money.  This also goes along with contacts with companies and such is my point.\n\nI had a (former) friend who's parents paid for him to live in a luxury apartment(and everything else) a block or so from the startup district for 10 years tell me that I just wasn't grinding as hard has he did to justify his success(got 10mil or so from an exit after 5-6 statups).  Bro you were living in a luxury apartment you didn't grind anything.  Thats the kind of people criticizing you.  They would rather you die then accept that their self idealization might not be as accurate as they fancy.\n\nI did a stint in management for a while.  It was way better and I'm also permanently heading that direction.",
            "Not sure how true this is for everyone but I was told that the seven year mark is usually when  devs hit a rut and don\u2019t want to code anymore. \nI personally went through it.

Probably lucky to have good product managers and tech folks where I never had to stress so much. \n\nCanadian market has always been shitty for many industries and low pay scale for last 20+ years.

So if you find software development stressful, its probably because you have a shitty manager.\n\n>**Im in Canada right now**\n\nThis is a huge factor. If not THE MAIN reason why things are as shitty as they are.\n\nCanada absolutely sucks for software engineering. All of our major cities with high paying software engineer jobs are almost as expensive as the major US tech hubs. But the average SWE salary is about half of what you would get in the US (and that's not even factoring in the USD being better than the CAD).\n\nIf moving to the US is not an option for you, then consider looking for a remote roll at a US company. Thats what I did, but I got lucky because everyone was hiring remote during covid. Its much harder to find a US company these days that is offering remote work.\n\nAnd while I don't make as much as my US based co-workers. I still make double what I did at my previous company.",

            "Hey budd, I am originally from Lebanon like yourself, and worked all my career outside of Lebanon, but made the fatal mistake of moving back to Lebanon and currently chilling in the warzone.  \n  \nI will comment point by point:\n\n    1- Average Pay\n\nYou are correct. The only nation that truly respect software engineers is the US, make no mistake. The only country that pays well for this field. Now you will get comments from people not in the US and telling you they make good money, please note there are people who haven't got any engineering or CS degree and moved from a minimum wage job to programming after bootcamp or something. For those, the upscaling in salary sounds pretty good. I assume you have a CS background, so yes for a person who went to university this field doesnt pay well unless you move to the US. I wish someone told me that long time ago.\n\n    2- The change of pace in technology\n\nIt does indeed change at a super fast pace, faster that most other fields. However it is what it is, if this is the main reason you feel like quitting, don't . Take breaks (min 3 weeks) and during those break do stuff that have NOTHING with technology, for example farming.\n\n    3- The local competition:\n\nIt is competitive locally, but more globally. From your edit I understand you are in north america, lots of outsourcing shops there to India. Again, the best place is the US, because it is a massive market and as much as there is competition, there remains lots of opportunities. Make no mistake, once again when it comes to software engineering the US is the land of opportunity. PS: Nowadays, post covid and ukraine war, must inquire further even for US jobs, as I am reading online from several source market is shit everywhere (any US engineers here to confirm?), so do your due diligence.\n\n    4- Offshoring\n\nExplained in (3)\n\n    5- Age\n\nNot necessarily. There is aging in some places especially startups (not because age means you cant code, quite the contrary, but because they want newcomers who don't know better and would work for peanuts). But it is more inflated in media and online than in reality. I know respectable companies like Google for example, hires experienced engineers, I read several times about folks older than 60 who got hired at google. So don't self indoctrinate about things that are not always true.\n\n    6- Legacy Code\n\nYeah all places have that. If you want to work without legacy code, only fresh startups are good environments for that.\n\n    7- Technical Interviews:\n\nYeah that is the WORST part of this whole career. It has become harder to interview than actually performing the job. Once again, this wont be changing anytime soon, we have been suggesting new interview approaches to companies and through conferences and others, to no avail. This sadistic interviewing system seems will stay there for a while unfortunately. I personally blame the very \"smart\" idea that \"entrepreneurs\" came up with, which is: anyone can code (even your gramma) and no need for degrees. Which in reality is a smart way from business people to lowers salaries, ie flood the market with \"engineers\" and automatically salaries get lowered. As a side effect, many folks who have no clue started interviewing, and companies started throwing exam like interviews which historically was handled by having a diploma which meant: hey those algorithms that i will probably never use in your company, i already studied and aced them during 5 years of studies, and if needed i could easily ramp up.\n\n    I can yap and yap how a career in software development is short lived and soul crushing. So I made the executive descision to go back to school to get my degree in management, and take on a management role. I'm craving some kind of stability where as I age I'm confident that my skills will still be relevant and not deprecated, even if that means I won't be paid much.\n\nOk that is a personal choice, you know what is best for you.\n\n    The problem is that I want to live my life, I don't want to spend it working my ass off, trying to fight of competition, technical debt, skill depreciation, devalution etc... I just want a dumb job where I do the work and go back home sit on my ass and watch some series...\n\nSoftware engineering is indeed a demanding job and it feels like the learning curve never ends. I kinda get where you going, but you gotta inquire about other jobs from people in those fields (working in the trenches) to see if the job is really 'dumb' or it actually requires more efforts than portrayed. Like don't underestimate anything.\n\nPS: lots of comments attacking you here and telling you 'you have skill issues'. I have been working in this field for long, this comment always surfaces anytime someone is struggling and need answers. Don't let it get into you, you have no skill issues. I guarantee you, the top skilled software engineers will NEVER put others down quite the contrary they are proud of their skills and would love to teach it to others. Those who decide you are unskilled  from a reddit post, are themselves unskilled most probably and so compensating, or haven't worked on a real life scalable project but been doing pet project or hello world tutorials.  \nIf you decide to stay in this field, the number one skill you will need is : build a thick skin. That is the major skill, the field is filled with people with inflated egos that are not there to cooperate but to tell you they are smarter than you. A thick skin is required, mute them and move forward with focus.\n\nWhatever you decide, wish you all the best.",

I've found her to be a teasure trove of info about SVGs and also web accessibility. AFAIK, she used to work for Khan Academy, I think? Plus freelance a lot. I'm just telling you about this because I hope it makes you feel less alone and maybe it can give you ideas, I don't know.\n\nAll I can say, and it might not apply since I'm in the US, is that how I stay sane with the technology changes is to not chase all of them. I'm over 40 and especially now hate to do that. I try to keep my learning opportunities to work as much as possible so I don't also have to study as much on top of working. Being in \"boring\" companies has also helped, but again, I don't know how it is in Lebanon. \n\nAnyway, I wish you safety and good luck in finding something that makes you happier. I couldn't imagine what I would find for myself to do if I left this field. I've been doing it since it was my hobby in high school. My only other thought would be to slide myself over into UX, but that's not so stress-free, either.",
            "I'm gonna say skill issue as well, I'm at \\~6-ish yoe, with a year long gap for side project breaks in there. 1 year VC backed startup, 3 years big tech/faang adjacent, almost 1 year faang, 1 year side project gap.  \n\n1. Average pay sure if you have a low stress job. My brother works at a bank and works 30-ish hours a week, makes $100k 1 year out of school. I am working 50-ish hours a week at faang, making $360k-ish per year will make mid 400s after promo, would probably already be there if I hadnt quit my last job to take a year off. Pick your poison. But why are you working so much for shit pay?    \n2. New stuff every year? lol. Maybe something new at each job. But I also think this whole \"constantly learning new shit all the time\" is so dumb. \"Oh no, I have to make a change that requires me to learn graphql\" its not like you have to become a master at it. Just know enough to do whatever you need to do. The whole, \"Oh every year theres a new framework\" shit is so blown out of proportion. And even if you did, I have only used CRA for like 5 years, last summer I decided to try out next for fun. Took maybe an afternoon before I felt like I knew how to use it. Expert? No. Do you need to be an expert? No.    \n3. Local competition - okay fair, to that I say, lock in. Wanna be in the top 1% of earners in the US 1 year out of college, god forbid you have to do some leetcoding...    \n4. This has literally never been a problem for me or anyone i know. If you think your competition is dudes overseas, then yeah maybe this isnt for you.    \n5. Lol you think an IC6/7/8 is doing the same thing as a fresh grad? Bruh.    \n6. Okay fair, legacy code sucks. But every job has shit that sucks.    \n7. Why are you reviewing OOP and solid principles for interviewing? Grind leetcode, grind system design and you are good. Probably interviewed with 20-30 companies in the last 5 years and have never been asked conceptual questions. It is always just leetcode and system design.  \n\nAlso why do you need a degree in management? Every manager I have ever worked with was just an IC software engineer who took a management opportunity. I also know a ton of managers who ended up becoming an IC again.",

I have disabled Outlook / Teams notifications and if someone calls outside the family / friends zone, I don\u2019t answer, I don\u2019t care and I don\u2019t give a fuck.\n\n-I don\u2019t push hard myself to finish assignments. I have a pace that works for normal assignments to finish them on time. If I notice that a assignment is too much and cannot be finished in a normal unstressed pace, i won\u2019t finish it and communicate that this assignment was too big, by giving reasons.\n\n-The outsourced colleagues do the same and even worse! A story can be dragged 2-3 sprints if it\u2019s unrealistic to finish on time. They work in their own pace and won\u2019t push themselves no matter what. On the end it\u2019s the company\u2018s problem and not their\u2018s.

        "content": "A little background: I graduated 1.5 years ago and I've been working full time at a top tech company since then. I have nice teammates, I have a good salary, and my work gets praised (even though a lot of times I deliver late). My manager also keeps telling me that he wants to promote me, I effectively just need to put in the effort to summarize my work and present it.\n\nI have learned much in the way of soft skills and project design, but I feel my technical skills are probably lacking as my team basically does very little coding. Everything revolves around using existing tools written ~5 years ago in order to maximize revenue. I feel that my coding skills are not at what an experienced engineer should have in terms of code design.\n\nI've been feeling a serious lack of motivation for the last ~6 months. I dread having to do work. I barely get any work done, basically just enough to float by and keep appearances up. I spend pretty much my entire day on my phone. I keep pushing the work back and end up working late into the night when I finally have to show something for the time I've spent. I'm not happy about this either as I'd rather just finish everything all at once so I can do stuff like play games without worrying in the back of my head.\n\nI've always been somewhat of a procrastinator, but I think the pandemic creating a situation where there are lots of distractions at home and very little accountability has made it much worse. My PTO is also being wasted as I'm capped but also don't want to take time off as I can't go anywhere I want to. Also, there are always deadlines and I don't want to let my teammates/manager down. \n\nI feel that I should be appreciative of my position since I have a stable job during the pandemic and make good money. I should also be promoted in ~1 quarter if I can motivate myself enough to put in effort to work through the process. My newest project is also something that finally has real coding.\n\nDespite all this, my motivation is at an all time low. I don't want to work, but I also don't want to leave since I know it would be good for my career if I can stick it out and get promoted as other companies would recognize my title. I would also likely need to spend a month or two getting back into shape with leetcode if I did quit.\n\nBasically I'm just at a loss for what to do, how can I motivate myself enough to stop procrastinating and get stuff done?",

Back during normal times whenever I felt bored I took a nice one week long vacation and by the time I came back I felt refreshed.\n\nI am am mobile developer but right now learning backend stuff; I found doing something different has brought back the interest for programming in me.

I also felt like maybe software development isn\u2019t for me - \u201cim not motivated like others are to learn, I only tolerate this job when it comes easy to me\u201d yadda yadda\n\nDecided to leave my company and take some time off. It\u2019s been massive for my mental health. I\u2019m feeling happy, motivated, and like myself again. I\u2019ve spent like 40+ hours a week working on a personal project, I literally can\u2019t get enough. Also had enough time to focus on working out more and being outside\n\nSo moral of the story for me is time off really helped me discover who I am again. It\u2019s very easy to get trapped in your own thoughts/anxieties, but with some time to yourself you realize maybe that role just wasent for you! If you can afford it I definitely recommend it. \n\nPlus the coolest thing is that friends, family, and coworkers haven\u2019t shamed me for doing it like I thought they would.

            "I just quit and come back when I'm reenergized",
            "I don't know how much your manager or boss knows that this is how you feel. I think it could be worth it to discuss how you are feeling, especially as most of us are at home, day in day out behind our screens and bosses or managers can't pick up on body language or facial expression to know you're getting bored and demotivated, so it needs to get communicated differently.\n\nIf you go to your manager and explain the current situation, plus some possibilities that you see to fix it, I don't see why it would go down badly.\n\nRegarding possibilities on how to fix this, I think trying to be honest with yourself is really important here. Some stuff might be fixable if your work changes, some stuff happens in our personal lives. There are some things none of us has control over at the moment, we've all been pretty much stuck inside for a year and that doesn't help. However there are things that are your responsibility, such as getting outside enough, having half an hour of exercise three times a week, guarding your sleep and trying to make the best of the situation you are in. If you soul-search a bit and you think you might be heading towards (or in a) depression, it's also something that needs addressing. And of course there's stuff that's purely work-related. It's probably a compound of all those things. If you think some of the issues are in the realm of your private life, you might need to ask for some PTO, just so that the pressure of work gets lifted. Which is you coming with a solution, not just complaining at the manager. Obviously if you see stuff at work that could make your life a lot better if it changes, mention it as well. \n\nI want to add something about procrastination however, purely on that aspect. It's a very vicious cycle. I've been where you are and one of the worst things that happens is this pushing off work until the last minute then sacrificing your evening to catch up. You ruin your working day and your time off, which means you're mentally in \"work-zone\" all the time and it will burn you down real fast. \"The Now Habit\" is a book that worked really well for me, in that it forces you to schedule your free time activities before your work and guards that.",
            "From some reading I\u2019ve done I\u2019ve found that true motivation that just springs forward from the void does not exist. It\u2019s really much more tangible than that. Motivation often times comes from an effort/reward loop. I struggled severely with motivation and feeling like I didn\u2019t have passion for literally anything, but it was because I wasn\u2019t willing to put in the effort that was needed to receive a reward that was worthwhile. \n\nI personally started with utilizing really simple tools like the Pomodoro technique just so I could practice putting intentional effort into what I was doing. It\u2019s quite difficult to get started, but once you do chances are you will continue. It is a steep first hurdle, but it is worth it. From my experience you have to muscle through it in the beginning and just get started. You don\u2019t have to plan to complete your entire project in a day. Just bargain with yourself and try to complete 15 lines of code. Inevitably that will get the ball rolling. \n\nI saw other people mention envisioning your future and what you want, and I totally agree with that. I would also add to think about what you are afraid of and use that as a stepping stone to try to motivate yourself to do the tough things. Someone recommended that, when I finish a tough work or learning session that I should take 10mins or so and just think about what I want to accomplish and how what I just did is helping me get there. It\u2019s a great little technique that can associate the work you just did with the better future you are looking forward to. \n\nGood luck to you",

I always have my iPad ready to take notes so nothing ever \"slips\" by me and I end every work day by going through my notes and organizing it and setting reminders/deadlines. Literally everything. I even have a reminder to check reddit and youtube for new content related to my field.\n\nI frequently switch between teamlead/manager and senior/principal engineer depending on the company and whatever I feel like doing at that time and the cognitive load for teamlead/manager positions goes basically to zero once you organize your life and outsource it to a computer.

            "Honestly, the pandemic is making lots of people feel weird and poorly imo. The isolation, the lack of fun activities and bringing work at home can interfere with your personal life. Sometimes having the possibility to physically separate work from home is a very good thing. Also, working from home isolates you from interacting with coworkers in the way we were used to. Social interaction at work however small has its bonuses for feeling fulfilled in one's career. It seems that you have a very good employer and you seem to definitely appreciate that but it seems the isolation is getting to you. It is maybe time to visit a health care professional to try to get some help and ask for some time off. For me time off did not work. I became even more lazy and disconnected so I went back, but not everyone is the same. But the visit to my doctor definitely helped. I was getting suffocating for being indoors all the time and in sweat pants all day and where I am the winter is long, cold and dark.

You finally know what it feels like to be bored again. It usually a signal that you are ready to be inspired and do bold things again.\n\nMy favorite meditative activity is taking a long walk in nature. Then I would talk to myself about anything that comes to mind when I am walking. I usually got insights while doing this. Sometimes, it clears my mind on what important things to do and how I can start right away -- which becomes momentum for me to start feeling great again. On some other times, that insight is to accept that I need some time off, to do things on my own terms, and make a plan to resign and look for other opportunities. \n\nAt least it always helps me to do something.

I feel like I\u2019m expected to keep my brain constantly operating at 110%, and I can\u2019t even take my foot off the gas for a second (even this hasn\u2019t been enough lately). At this point I don\u2019t know if this is burnout or just a sign that I\u2019m not cut out to be a developer.\n\nFor the last month or so I haven\u2019t even had time to do things I like anymore like go to the gym, play video games, or even talk to my friends.

            "Although a lot of comments here already cover great points, I think I should contribute. I have been in the industry for 4 years, went through a terrible company and am now in a better position. Actually, I've just started training new hires recently!\n\nAnd as someone with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, I had my quite bit of suffering with insecurities and panic attacks, and would like to share some insights that either I have heard or wish I had heard when I was starting:\n\n1 - You are not a machine. Developing is a mentally tiresome process, that requires focus, creativity and patience. No one can stay focused, creative and patient for 8-10 hours no stop everyday, and that's fine! We all get distracted, have our slow days/weeks or have \"non-productive\" time periods. Just today I got so distracted while developing something that I started brushing my dog in a poor demonstration of procrastination. Give yourself some permission to not deliver 110%, and don't let anyone treat you like a machine: not you, nor your boss;\n\n2 - You are learning. If someone doesn't get or respect that you have just started your career, it's their fault. Trust your value and your learning capacity and, although this easier said than done, don't see this as a race. Learn and grow on your rhythm, this is your best moment to do so;\n\n3 - Toxic environments exist and are never tolerable. If your boss yells at you, focus on trying to find a different job, in a place capable of seeing the great benefits that someone new in the market can bring;\n\n4 - Do not, by any means, think that you are not cut out for development. Of course, if you realize you are not that much into it, that's fine! But otherwise, if it's your insecurities who are telling you that, don't think like this. You may not be a senior yet, but YOU ARE A GREAT DEVELOPER JUST BY LIKING TO DEVELOP. Grow, learn, develop yourself on your rhythm. You are full of potential, and I mean it;\n\n5 - Finally, if the burnout feeling persists, talk to some friends and maybe consider consulting a professional. There's no shame in doing so, and my therapist helped me in a lot of dark periods!\n\nFinally, I wish things get better for you OP. Don't let toxic environments and the insecurities get to your head!

            "I started my career with a company called Accenture. It was hellish. They say you sell your soul to the devil when you work for them. My first two years had a lump sum \u00a340k bonus so I couldn\u2019t quit before the 2 year mark or I\u2019d lose it. I rarely left the office before 7pm and often worked until 11pm. It was hell. And I was a consultant and traveled a lot.\n\nBut that work ethic stuck with me after I left. And no matter where I worked after that I always went the extra mile. My colleagues would be out the door at 5pm and I\u2019d keep working. It was never about finishing my day at a certain time. It was about finishing what I was working on and getting my code working and checked in. Sometimes I left at 5pm sometimes I worked late. It was never about time. That was the habit I had formed.\n\nI reached the pinnacle of my career as Technical Architect when I was 33 (that\u2019s as high as you can go in software engineering in a technical role - I had no interest in CTO or VP Engineering I\u2019m a coder not a manager). So I was Technical  architect  then lead technical architect for another 6 years and at age 39 I finished my last job.\n\nI now work for myself - I write trading algorithms for the financial markets and I work as much or as little as I want.\n\nThis comment will get downvoted because this sub is predominantly filled with people who want to work as little as possible. \n\nThat\u2019s not my philosophy and isn\u2019t Elon Musk\u2019s, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerbergs, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs.\n\nHard work is tough at first then it becomes tolerable then it becomes habit. And then it sets you free. When you work twice as hard as your peers you become twice as good. The more time you spend writing code the better a programmer you become. \n\nAnd then you get to a point when you can choose not to work any more. Like Jeff Bezos, Bill gates. Or you can sleep in the office like Elon Musk. Me I\u2019m a little in the middle. I did no work from January to September this year and since then I\u2019ve been working on something new and been at my desk 8am - 9pm every day except Christmas Day. \n\nBut I\u2019m working on my terms. I cannot imagine anything worse than working into my 60s to retirement age in an office 9 til 5 making someone else rich. Fuck that. Work hard. Set yourself free.\n\nGetting yelled at isn\u2019t cool though. But I\u2019ve learned from participating in this sub that things that are acceptable in America are not acceptable in the UK and Europe. Your manager would be the subject of a grievance investigation if he did that here. That would be very damaging to his career. \n\nSo while I\u2019m definitely an advocate of hard work.

First off, it is common sense.  Maybe not common sense that you should know it at birth, but if you heard an extremely popular term over and over again, it only takes about 30 minutes to get the general concept of perhaps one of the most important fundamental philosophies of software engineerg, especially since you are working on something that requires 24/7 maintenance, and never bothered looking it up - I'd be worried about what you are doing.  And if you haven't done that for other parts of CS, I'm not sure you have the fundamental knowledge to ask the important, specific questions that a manager would answer.\n\nWhat I am saying is that the quickest way to get under some one's skin is to ask stuff that people would have looked up, and should have looked up, beforehand.",

Having to move back to your parent's house is NOT shameful (I want to say ever, but at the very least, not now). If anything, it is a well-learned lesson to always keep at least 6 month's in living expenses in cold hard cash, always.\n\nNext, can you find a job to get by? I'm not talking FAANG, I'm talking anything that bites. Even a job stocking shelves, whatever. I'm saying this not to imply that you should go and become a barista. What I'm saying is, what's your baseline? What's the worst that can happen? If the worst that can happen is that you move back to your parents' house and work as a cashier, you are genuinely in an amazing boat. You have a social safety net that's greater than many people in this country. You are working an overqualified job with the chance to jump back into your old career at any time -- others hold that job because it's one of the few jobs they can hold.\n\nThis is a mental trick. Once you have accounted for the worst possible scenario, you will realize that you have a very safe path right now, in a world of turmoil. This will put your mind at ease. You are well equipped for the next 20-30 years of your career. This is nothing but a small setback, a bump in the road.

Learn something new that isn\u2019t algorithmic/data structure related!\n\nAs many other people have mentioned look around at the rest of the country/world, there are millions of unemployed. When things get back to normal, job interviews will include a lot of slack for being unemployed at some point for some duration this year. Don\u2019t sweat it too much.\n\nFocus on yourself.

            "One option: Find a job in a smaller company, not even necessarily a tech company, where you can grow organically as you do more and more, and you don't have to take leetcode tests and shit.  They exist.  They might not seem like the sexiest job, but you can have the biggest impact of your career.  In companies like this you can generate types of projects that they didn't even realize were possible but in a big tech company would've been a given.  Spend a few years building them up and learning stuff you want to learn on your own time.  You'll be refreshed, have a good resume booster, and perhaps a much higher position in the company.. then you can go back to big tech if you want to or start your own thing.  You have good experience and shouldn't have any issue finding such a job with a good pay boost from your last job\n\nIts not always about doing what is best for your wallet or career, somethings you do need a little vacation or break to reset to improve your long term career health and give you a deload period to just apply the skills you have and not be so stressed.

You could also consider coming over to a field like biotech where you will be absolutely valued, have way less stress, have high pay, and will be able to grow rapidly and maintain career growth indefinitely.

I was also a professor/advisor in higher education (incl as CIS professor) for eight years, so I can relate to recent graduates and the challenges. Please try to change your view on this.

It's like experimenting in software product development; it's the experiments that help us learn exactly what works for customers. When I worked for a Seattle company, I learned that in a booming high-tech job market, it actually looks odd to hiring managers if you've been in a single job for too long - seems odd, and I'm not sure I believe that. But I was told it means that person hasn't been able to find other opportunities because they aren't \"wanted\" by other companies.\n\nI would also propose that you do some reading to help you get perspective and address the self-esteem / self-doubt.

Work hard in ways that will reward you later, either via improving your own skills, achieving personally-satisfying success, or hitting metrics or \"making impact\" that will actually get you raises at your current job.  If your manager is giving you shit work that is unpleasant and will not be rewarded, talk to them and let it be known that you expect a fair trade for it in some other way (i.e. better work later).\n\nDo *not* work hard out of a sense of duty to a company that is not going to actually reward you for it.  If the company doesn't respect and reward a sense of duty, then *work towards the metrics*.\n\nDo *not* accept work on a deadline you can't deliver without a written (e.g. email) protest of some sort with your own expected finish date.

            "At the end of the day a job's a job. I like to hang out in contracting -- there are bunches of contracting companies that'll do you a W2 and provide some benefits. If you're laid off from a position in a company while in a position like that, they can sometimes offer placement elsewhere as well. As a contractor, you rarely get asked to put in overtime, get paid for it if you do and the contracting company stays out of your hair for the most part. You also do tend to get a higher hourly salary, which helps make up for the difference in benefits and usual lack of paid vacation. So it doesn't hurt to develop a fairly mercenary attitude to the industry fairly early.\n\n\nUpdate your resume on Linkedin and bunches of those guys will come to you. Most of those guys suck, but there is the occasional good one who can put you in a job. I'd expect this to be especially true in the Bay Area. So update that resume, apply for positions that look interesting to you as you see them and hopefully unemployment can keep you afloat until you find a new job. It probably will take less time than you think, although it's always quite stressful until you land one.

            "Burnout is when you keep doing task after task and can never feel a sense of accomplishment and instead you feel overwhelmed by events beyond your control. Taking a break doesn't solve this issue, you need to figure out how to work in a way that satisfying and learn to not worry about what you cannot control. Usually, people learn a few coping skills and then can deal with the stress through changes in lifestyle as they age, but you can take a more disciplined approach.  \n\n\nFor me, I got burnt out after my first industry job: 8 months working at a small fintech start up with an arguably psychopath CEO. I kept doing work, got stressed out over the CEO and the general stress of being a developer, and didn't have the stress relief valves in my life, or a good perspective on the position.  \n\n\nNow, I've been in the industry for the better part of 7 years, and my life is much more balanced. I walk my dog twice a day for at least an hour each time, no matter what is going on at work. I've also adjusted my outlook, and try to take a stoic view of things. I can only control what I do, and what I spend time thinking about. Everything else is just beyond my control and therefore is not something I should be worrying about, although it's hard to not actually worry in practice. Your job doesn't define you, so don't let it. Figure out something that motivates you to do excellent work, but be \"walk away safe\" from a job at a moments notice.",
            "This is not likely to apply to most people, but I will share in the event that it might help someone. I dealt with burnout in my first job. My answer to it was surprisingly simple; I started working less. \n\nI don't mean working less hours, I mean working less during my 9-5 hours. When I started, I had the idea in my head that I needed to spend every moment during those hours being productive. If I got stuck, I would spend an hour or two looking into it before asking for help. Then I'd send the email, and continue to investigate. I would inevitably not make any progress and be frustrated by the time I got the help I needed. \n\nSimilar things like this would happen to me all the time since I was still learning. It was sapping all my energy and by the time the day was over my brain was totally drained. It was so bad I needed to speak with a therapist, which is how I found out about the burnout.\n\nFrom what I learned, burnout is inevitable if any of the following occur in your work:\n\nUnfairness,\nValue mismatch,\nLack of reward,\nIsolation,\nOverwork,\nLack of control\n\nFor me, it was overwork and lack of control (in when and how I worked). I was lucky and these were both entirely self-inflicted. The next time I got stuck and needed help, I sent the email and walked away for a bit. I just stopped thinking about it until I got the response. I did my due diligence but it wasn't enough and I needed help. There's nothing wrong with that, especially when you're starting out. I also started taking more mini breaks (5-15 minutes) throughout the day whenever I needed time to decompress from a problem or I finished a task.\n\nThis helped me tremendously on a personal level but I was concerned about how my work might be perceived. It turned out that my work actually improved since I had more energy to work when I had the pieces I needed to do the job. I did so much better, in fact, that I got a promotion a few months later. So I worked less, and performed better.\n\nAgain, my experience may not apply to everyone, but if you're a fellow type A, just give yourself a little grace now and then.",

Need to eat healthy, get healthy hobby or the way I work may be stressing and need some improvements. \n\nIf coworkers aren't getting burnt, why am I? There are people who make much less or even have no jobs. I should be grateful for this. \n\nBut in the end, my wife always brings me smile when I'm home.

Therapy won't magically cure this, but therapy could help you stop thinking this way.\n\nVacation does not cure burnout, it is a temporary fix because you just stop working. Your burnout will be waiting for you the moment you go back to work unless you change your mindset.\n\nJust changing jobs doesn't fix it either, because the problem *is your mindset,* not the company. The company may play a role, but for as long as you think that you need to grind to meet unrealistic deadlines, you will eventually burnout no matter where you are.\n\nThe good-ish news is it is extremely common. You're not alone. A lot of people think they need to grind to meet unrealistic deadlines early in their career before they learn better.\n\nThe first step is to view yourself as a 40 hour resource. Your company pays you for the best 40 hours you can give them. You as the engineer inform management what a realistic timeline for a given ask is, it's on them if they ignore it. You as the engineer give regular status updates to management indicating progress towards the deadline, including if it's way off track and going to be missed, it's on them if they ignore it.\n\nThe big mistake SWEs make is thinking deadlines are their problem. Deadlines are a ***project management*** concern, not an engineering concern. Management has lots of tools in their toolbelt to deal with at risk deadlines. They can dial back scope, hire more resources, or push back the deadline. This is literally project management 101. Expecting their engineers to work over 40 hours is not a healthy option.\n\nA missed deadline is a failure of ***management***, not the engineers. Do not overwork yourself to bail shitty management out of the situation they put themselves in.\n\nWork your 40 hours. Log off at 5pm, go for a walk or something, physically disconnect yourself from work. Do not check Slack, or email after 5pm (on call being the exception).\n\nOnce you change your mindset, and focus on establishing professional boundaries, you'll find your burnout will go away pretty quickly.

            "It sucks you're feeling burn out and depressed. Burnout among software developers is a popular topic, and I'm curious why. If I recall correctly, burnout was first studied among people working in the caring professions, and it makes sense there: a constant stream of sick or injured patients, some of whom will never recover.\n\nOne might think burnout would be less common among software developers for these reasons:\n\n1. Most software developers are not dealing with life-or-death situations like some doctors or surgeons. Many businesses try to instill a sense of urgency among software developers working with them, but the stakes are usually much, much lower and often totally artificial.\n2. The pay is better than most jobs available to people with a bachelor's degree or less education and no elite social connections.\n3. There is negligible immediate physical danger unlike coal mining or other physically hazardous occupations. The danger is the slow effects of a sedentary desk job: posture, eye strain, carpal-tunnel syndrome, and the psychological effects we're discussing.\n4. Software development, especially the average development job out there, can have its share of monotony, but it probably still has greater variety than many jobs: certainly literal assembly-line work.\n\nSo what are the hypotheses?\n\n1. On average, people who tend to go into software development have a greater predisposition to things like burnout. This is quite possible: Extraversion is correlated with higher positive affect (enthusiasm and cheerfulness), and software developers tend to be more introverted.\n2. Burnout isn't really especially more common among software developers than among many other occupations. Software developers may just spend more time online writing blog and forum posts about it. Some people may consider symptoms of burnout to be just inherent to working and not think of it as such.\n3. There may be something intrinsic to software development that eventually causes burnout in a significant portion of developers. It can be more socially isolating than many jobs, and a good social life is strongly correlated with happiness. Many software developers are spending the bulk of their time on technical problems that are fussy, requiring active, close attention, and various painstaking follow-up steps and checks but without any deeper creativity or intellectual engagement.\n4. There may be something about the social environment surrounding software development. A lot of software developers are prone to pedantry and perfectionism with a few narrow but deep interests.\n5. Beyond peers, the workplace is usually set up as one of business people commanding developers with some niceties on top (here's a ticket, work the ticket; done with that ticket? have another ticket. why haven't you closed more tickets?). This can start to feel like a figurative assembly line: tickets in, code out.\n6. Keeping oneself employable is a lot of work in addition to the day job. We all know about the horror of algorithm-and-data-structures-puzzle interviews and the various other hoops to be jumped, expectations to keep current on changing technology (often fairly superficial churn), etc.\n7. At least in the United States, I think software engineering often comes with low social status, relative to pay.\n\n----\n\nAt this point in my career (over ten years in), I consider day-to-day business coding to be about as interesting as doing taxes. The difference is doing taxes is a few hours of work once a year. So sometimes you've got to do a little boring coding work, but you don't want it to consume your day every day, or you're going to burn out hard, I'd think.",

Using metrics like story points or complexity assessments for features can help provide a clearer picture of what's realistically achievable. This can also help in discussions with leadership about setting more attainable goals.\n\nWhen it comes to communicating with your leadership team, it's all about framing your concerns constructively. Instead of just pointing out the issues, could you try presenting them as an opportunity for improvement? You might say something like, \"I've noticed that we often roll out features that aren't fully complete. We can set more realistic expectations by assessing our project complexity upfront and ultimately deliver better quality work.\" This shows that you're looking out for the team's success rather than just pushing back on deadlines.\n\nAlso, be sure to prioritize your well-being! Burnout can sneak up quickly when we're in high-pressure situations. I wrote an article on [Simple Ways to Stop Software Developer Burnout Early](https://danschaefer.dev/blog/simple-ways-to-stop-software-developer-burnout-early/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=comment&utm_campaign=r/cscareerquestions) that covers some practical strategies for maintaining balance and avoiding that pitfall.",
            "This is the purpose of Agile/Scrum. A lot of businesses do not practice it religiously, and it jades a lot of developers who never formally studied it and only learned about it OTJ.\n  \nIdeally, during release planning, business should have high-level features defined, and you should be working closely together to convert them into user stories, then consolidating them into a backlog. This is where the team collectively gauages the initial complexity of each story and assigns it a point value. Additionally, they'll agree on the number of sprints per release.\n  \nAfterward, during sprint planning, the team will select a set of user stories to work on keeping priority / point values in mind and adjusting initial point values based on experience/observations from previous sprints before starting the sprint.\n  \nAt the end of each sprint, you should be doing a retrospective that captures how many points were attempted vs. completed. This helps define a reasonable workload and enables you to better communicate expectations to stakeholders in future planning sessions."

I was the lead/manager of developers in a small software company for 2 years and worked 5-6 days/week, usually 50-60 hours/week but also a bunch of weekends to get client projects done. These even included a few 48-hr slogs (48 hours of straight working with no sleep) to meet client deadlines that my boss had agreed to without my input.\n\nI did this for nearly 2 years with no days off and no vacation time.\n\nOne time, after a couple of major projects were delivered and we had some downtime before upcoming deadlines, I submitted a request for **1 day** off. I took a day off. The next day I continued working as usual but got called in to my boss's (the CEO) office and he lectured me about commitment and being responsible. I continued my normal work schedule.\n\n1 week later I was called in and fired for being \"distracted\". The CEO told me he needed someone more committed and responsible.\n\nSo yea after busting my ass for 2 years for this guy for only $70k salary and no benefits, I was fired for taking a day off.\n\nMy mental health suffered badly over the following 6 months and it took that long to get my head together to find another job.\n\nBut that stint blew through my savings, and I've been getting by with no savings since then by budget shopping, no major purchases, no vacations, etc. I don't take days off anymore because of that experience and haven't taken a vacation from work in over 15 years.\n\nBurnout is a real thing, and it's serious. I struggle with it daily. I have had more recent jobs in which HR *forced* me to take days off because of their stupid rules about not being able to carry days over.

I suspect the obvious choices are the UAW (sounds weird, but the UAW has a big presence in academia) or the Communication Workers (basically, who has white collar workers that aren't public sector). Then it requires a *tremendous* amount of education and combating of misinformation. The university (falsely) told international students their visas would be in jeopardy if they unionised.

High-skilled people with experience are still employed, still very well compensated, and still have pretty decent lateral mobility within the industry. All this indicates that the laborer has pretty decent leverage in this industry above the most junior levels. The \"all-for-one, one-for-all\" mentality also can't possibly function among a group of workers make $30k on one of the experience/talent spectrum and $800k on the other.

            "> extreme job scarcity, mass layoffs, burnout, rising concerns over ethical practices\n\nJob scarcity is not a unionizable issue.  Nor directly is burnout.  When you get into \"ethical practices\" you *really* start losing support.  The \"always on\" is something to negotiate, though the solution isn't something that people necessarily want.\n\nEthical practices gets into an issue of company ethics.  Should a company be able to contract with the US government?  Certain departments within the government?  That's not a union matter.  If it *is* something that a union tries to argue one way or the other, it will likely fall below the levels needed to support it.\n\nAlways on is solvable - be hourly rather than salary and punch in and out when you're working.  This also means that if you're hourly and work 10 - 2, you only get paid for 10 - 2.  *Furthermore* if you put that you work 9-5 when only working 10-2 you will get in not minor legal trouble for wage theft.  But it is a solvable problem and that's a way that a union could negotiate it.\n\nBetter working conditions is not an industry wide thing. Additionally \"better working conditions\" differs by experience and family situation.  Junior devs will often have better working conditions in the office than in a remote environment.  Senior devs and people with families may find remote to be better.  Free food in break rooms is not something that constitutes something that would be a union negotiation point and potentially would be something that would disappear as a differentiable bonus for certain companies in that they would be prohibited for offering non-financial incentives to work outside of core working hours (this is the why companies do it).\n\n> Worker pay has decreased significantly over the past few years ...\n\nWorker pay *hasn't* decreased as much as people want to claim.  The charts that people use for that tend to miss other parts of the data that lead to those numbers.  Things like \"a higher portion of people got hired in regular companies than Big Tech\" makes the apparent wages go down, even while all the pay is increased.\n\nOn the charts thing.  People often point to [Stack Overflow Survey 2024](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/work#salary) and say Backend is only $67k while [least year](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#work-salary) it was $76k.  But what they miss is that in 2023 it was 11k respondents from the US and 1.8k respondents from India and 2024 it was 4.4k respondents from the US and 1,011 respondents from India.  Looking at just US numbers 2023 was $165k and 2024 was $170k -- the average pay went up.\n\nI will *further* point out that trying to argue that wages for Big Tech going from (making up numbers) $200k to $180k or a TC of $280k dropping to $250k because the stock price is down this year... that's not entirely something that is going to win too many people outside of a Big Tech company unionizing *within that company*.  You want me to join your strike because you went from $250k to $210k TC because the stock is down?  Cry me a river in Brazil.\n\n> ... and things like job security, work-life balance, and other protections are becoming bigger issues.\n\nChatGPT and Copilot are banned.  Hourly work is enforced (see above) and while an exempt worker so it can't be 1.5x pay, overtime tracking and pay is required.  \n\nI am not going to say that a union is bad - I am a member of one within the public sector.  However, the things that get brought up for unionizing are ones that are difficult to get consensus around.\n\nYou'll end up with something like Alphabet Worker's Union.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Workers_Union\n\n> [Alphabet Worker's Union] was announced on January 4, 2021 with an initial membership of over 400, after over a year of secret organizing, and the union includes all types of workers at Alphabet, including full-time, temporary, vendors and contractors of all job types.\n\n> It has been called a minority union and a solidarity union. AWU itself is not registered with the National Labor Relations Board and cannot engage in collective bargaining. In March, 2022 subcontractors of Google Fiber became the first within the AWU to gain NLRB recognition\n\nIf you want to unionize - go for it.  Unions at individual companies can work.  \n\n> On April 13, 2021, more than 650 tech workers at the New York Times announced that they were unionizing with the NewsGuild-CWA. In July 2021 the workers filed for union certification with the National Labor Relations Board. On August 11, 2021, the New York Times Tech Guild held a half-day work stoppage in protest of alleged union-busting tactics from the New York Times management for which the Guild filed at least three unfair labor practices charges with the NLRB. At the time the union was certified, it was the largest union representing tech workers with collective bargaining rights in the country.\n\nAnd so you ask...\n\n> What do you think would be the main obstacles in getting something like this off the ground?\n\nThe extreme disparity wages and perks between Big Tech and the regular companies suggests that trying to have a single union be able to collectively bargain across them would run into difficulties.  The solution to that isn't likely to give everyone at regular companies Big Tech wages and perks.",

Software engineering would benefit from similar professional associations that can preserve innovation while ensuring things like the privacy of people's sensitive personal information, the security of the systems developed, and the stability and availability of critical information infrastructure.\n\nRight now we're in a position where (1) the right people have to be on a team to know something insecure is being proposed; (2) they have to have the knowledge of more secure alternatives to propose; (3) they're willing to give a firm no if reasonable alternatives are all rejected; (4) they do not fear push-back from product and engineering management over costs and timelines; and (5) they're ultimately willing to risk burning bridges or even getting fired if it comes down to it.\n\nIf push comes to shove, some things cannot be done and some corners cannot be cut because to do otherwise would be malpractice; there's a paper trail; and any engineer still willing to ignore it would face professional consequences beyond their current client or employer.\n\nOf course, today companies that have massive data breaches or significant downtime that impact individuals and businesses can face lawsuits, but this hasn't been a sufficient deterrent if it keeps happening. Economists call that an *externality*; the costs (minus risk of lawsuit) is externalized to customers and the customers' customers (and so forth) or the general environment.\n\nLawsuits and bad press are laggy and unreliable signals. We're engineers; we need to work back to the root cause, where cavalier decisions are turned into production code. Professional associations are no panacea, but many of the most egregious data breeches are happening outside \"tech\" companies, where software development may be considered a cost center and management may be whipping people to work faster or hiring people who don't know any better.\n\nAnd I think you get there by helping other people see how how they benefit and building up the public perception of how competent software engineers (not just the founders or CEOs) play a part in that.\n\nWe don't have these professional associations today, so in the mean time, people should use the leverage they have, individually and collectively, to fight against the causes of mass burnout, \"the pressure to be 'always on,'\" and rash practices that erode trust.",

The supply of workers chasing those jobs is much higher than the demand, but, unfortunately, a lot of tech workers are reluctant to swallow their pride and recognize that they're not special.\n\nUltimately, I think the super high-paying jobs will have to dry up and the industry will have to continue treating workers badly for several more years before unionization gains traction.",

And Ive started doing the same instead of trying to come up with something that sounds good. I mean, I think its fair...like everyone isnt going to be on and at 100% every day.  Also, there will be days when I dont get a dang thing done, and other days when Im up early, start working at 7a or dont knock off work til 6 or 7p and just have this groove going where Im tearing through stuff.\n\nAnd at least for my team, it seems like we all have that ebb and flow and it all evens out in the end. Only thing that seems to matter is if we're hitting our goals and getting things done. Too many of those \"I didnt get anything done\" days would likely be an issue, but if its every so often and not impacting overall progress, no big.\n\nLike I said though, team dependent. My last team had a culture of getting work done before coming to work, going home and continuing to work til all hours of the middle of the night, weekeneds, holidays, it was pretty terrible and no way ever I could get away with saying I didnt get anything done all day.  We were kind of expected to get things done at all times. So yeah, Id just say a bunch of words that sounded good and be all, thats it for me.",

I thought I\u2019d give it a shot to help out the team, but it\u2019s been much harder than I expected and has been eating up a lot of my time and energy. I\u2019ve been meeting with a senior dev regularly, and I usually find I\u2019m on the right track, but the task itself just feels like a grind.\n\nOn top of that, my manager mentioned a monthly performance target, and I\u2019m worried about hitting it, especially with this tough ticket dragging me down. I\u2019m starting to feel pretty burned out, and I\u2019m not sure how to bring this up with my boss in a way that shows I\u2019m committed but need some support.\n\nFor those who\u2019ve been through similar situations, how did you handle it?

You've already done a lot of ground-work it sounds like, so if it's burning you out then perhaps handing it over to someone with a fresh perspective could be more productive.\n\nIt's not an excuse if you're just being open and honest about what's going on, and being active on solving a technical issue is equally important as being active on solving a meta issue like this (you making this post is a great example of that). It's an excuse if this is something that happens every time and you just say the same thing to get away with it, but it doesn't sound like that's the case here."

        "content": "I graduated university by leeching off my friends in coding projects and just memorized enough to get my diploma; I had ZERO coding experience/aptitude.\n\nMy programming journey started by doing LeetCode questions and I just felt incredibly stupid. I eventually was able to understand the logic behind 1 question but I didnt feel like I really progressed. \n\nThen I went to Udemy to do some online courses aaaaaaand yup. Tutorial Honeymoon phase. I felt like I was progressing and doing actual programming. Once I wanted to try to do what I\u2019ve learned on my own, I realized, I had no idea how to start.\n\nOnce I decided to make my own projects, (and I emphasize that this is the crucial turning point to start the upswing) things started to click and connect. \n\nI started by literally spending a whole day just memorizing how to create a project:\nnpx create-react-app [project name], cd [project name], npm start. Then slowly but surely, I Googled and YouTubed what I wanted to do. It was a simple React Counting app, then I wanted to learn Hooks, then I wanted to learn CSS... it just kept snowballing. Before I knew it, I had my own portfolio website, a couple of projects I\u2019ve completed on my own and I felt ready to apply. \n\nApplying is a numbers game. I applied to 10 jobs a day for 3 months straight. I\u2019ve gotten maybe 15 calls in those 3 months. Of the 15 calls, 6 of them gave me a chance with a technical test, and of those 6 chances, I\u2019ve failed 5 of them. The one I didnt fail? I made it to the final round of interviewing only to lose because someone else just had more experience than me. \n\nI was tired and drained but not too long after that final round silver medal, I got an email offer.\n\nI\u2019ve never been so happy to get an offer in my life. All the struggle was worth it. I would also like to say that I identify as a \u201cgifted burnout\u201d and I did therapy to help me overcome my \u201cchild prodigy\u201d ego or whatever you wanna call it. \n\nIf you feel like you\u2019re past your prime or you cant learn to program, learn from a gifted-burnout-slacker like me.

It was for a prestigious university, I was proud to work there and I enjoyed the work I do. That continued through COVID and even into last year. Then inflation hit, prices started to go up and my salary just...didn't. We have 1 kid and money was already tight but now I was finding myself having to regularly use savings to pay my monthly expenses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI got really annoyed and started interviewing for other jobs (this was in late 2022) and although I got some interviews, they inevitably ended up in ghosting or laughably low salaries for what they were demanding. Now I can't even get interviews to the point that I've all but given up. I was spending hours of my life staying up until 1..2...3..4am tweaking my resume to apply to jobs just to be rejected (or more accurately) ghosted. So  I've more or less given up on that (for now at least).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm hoping to get promoted to the point that I can at least pay my bills but I'm so fed up of life, work and just everything right now. I'm showing up for work and just going through the motions to collect a pay check. I no longer get enjoyment from my job or feel fulfilled. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess my question(s) are:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Is this what burnout feels like?\n2. If it is burnout what am I supposed to do?

New job in 2017, super excited, non-tech organization & started out low pay but extremely flexible schedule and interesting work. Had 1 kid during Covid and bought a house, and have been dealing w/burnout & depression & exhaustion ever since with the added weight of needing to provide income & health insurance while *wanting* to go travel and give our kid the level of childhood I enjoyed but can\u2019t currently afford. \n\nI\u2019ve done all the things at work, mostly by myself, am bored & demotivated. There\u2019s zero opportunity for promotion and the small raises aren\u2019t cutting it. I have wanted to quit for a while & hate programming most days. This year w/inflation & rising cost of living for every damn thing has made staying put even more untenable, but the job market being shit means feeling trapped and that just feeds the burnout/depression.\n\nWhat has helped me (a little bit) mentally is:\n\n- more exercise \n\n- better diet (cheaper too to make food vs eating out anywhere)\n\n- better sleep & not staying up until 3am anymore\n\n- starting the process of trying to see someone for my mental health\n\n- focusing on enjoying family time because our kid won\u2019t be this small forever. \n\n- starting a new project at work with a partner who knows more than me and can help me learn new/marketable skills (1st time that has happened the entire time I\u2019ve been there). \n\nOnly 1 of the above might be out of your control. Start with the others. Set your actual resume aside and start engaging in resume-driven development at work instead.

        "content": "[https://www.wsj.com/tech/tech-jobs-artificial-intelligence-cce22393](https://www.wsj.com/tech/tech-jobs-artificial-intelligence-cce22393)\n\nFinding a job in tech by applying online was fruitless, so Glenn Kugelman resorted to another tactic: It involved paper and duct tape.\n\nKugelman, let go from an online-marketing role at\u00a0[eBay](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/EBAY), blanketed Manhattan streetlight poles with 150 fliers over nearly three months this spring. \u201cRECENTLY LAID OFF,\u201d they blared. \u201cLOOKING FOR A NEW JOB.\u201d The 30-year-old posted them outside the offices of Google,\u00a0[Facebook](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/META)\u00a0and other tech companies, hoping hiring managers would spot them among the \u201clost cat\u201d signs. A QR code on the flier sent people to his LinkedIn profile.\n\n\u201cI thought that would make me stand out,\u201d he says. \u201cThe job market now is definitely harder than it was a few years ago.\u201d\u00a0\n\nOnce heavily wooed and fought over by companies, tech talent is now wrestling for scarcer positions. The stark reversal of fortunes for a group long in the driver\u2019s seat signals more than temporary discomfort. It\u2019s a reset in an industry that is fundamentally readjusting its labor needs and pushing some workers out.\n\nPostings for software development jobs are down more than 30% since February 2020, according to Indeed.com. Industry layoffs have continued this year with tech companies shedding around 137,000 jobs since January, according to Layoffs.fyi. Many tech workers, too young to have endured the dot-com bubble burst in the early 2000s, now face for the first time what it\u2019s like to hustle to find work.\u00a0\n\nCompany\u00a0[strategies are also shifting](https://www.wsj.com/tech/techs-new-normal-microcuts-over-growth-at-all-costs-b80bb18b?mod=article_inline). Instead of growth at all costs and investment in moonshot projects, tech firms have become laser focused on revenue-generating products and services. They have pulled back on entry-level hires, cut recruiting teams and jettisoned projects and\u00a0[jobs in areas](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-industry-reversal-intensifies-with-new-rounds-of-layoffs-11673134201?mod=article_inline&mod=article_inline)\u00a0that weren\u2019t huge moneymakers, including virtual reality and devices.\u00a0\n\nAt the same time, they started putting\u00a0[enormous resources into AI](https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/breaking-down-the-tech-giants-ai-spending-surge-e282ca24?mod=article_inline). The release of ChatGPT in late 2022 offered\u00a0[a glimpse into](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chatgpt-ai-chatbot-app-explained-11675865177?mod=article_inline&mod=article_inline)\u00a0generative AI\u2019s ability to create humanlike content and potentially transform industries. It ignited a frenzy of investment and a race to build the most advanced AI systems. Workers with expertise in the field are among the few strong categories.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for a while. I kind of know the boom-bust cycle,\u201d says Chris Volz, 47, an engineering manager living in Oakland, Calif., who has been working in tech since the late 1990s and was laid off in August 2023 from a real-estate technology company. \u201cThis time felt very, very different.\u201d\u00a0\n\nFor most of his prior jobs, Volz was either contacted by a recruiter or landed a role through a referral. This time, he discovered that virtually everyone in his network had also been laid off, and he had to blast his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 out for the first time in his career. \u201cContacts dried up,\u201d he says. \u201cI applied to, I want to say, about 120 different positions, and I got three call backs.\u201d\n\nHe worried about his mortgage payments. He finally landed a job in the spring, but it required him to take a 5% pay cut.\n\n# No more red carpet\n\nDuring the pandemic, as consumers shifted much of\u00a0[their lives](https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-sales-surge-amid-pandemic-driven-online-shopping-11604003107?mod=article_inline)\u00a0and spending online, tech companies went on hiring sprees and took on far too many workers. Recruiters enticed prospective employees with generous compensation packages, promises of perpetual flexibility,\u00a0[lavish off sites](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-startups-ditch-the-office-for-far-flung-bonding-trips-11623854510?mod=article_inline)\u00a0and even a\u00a0[wellness ranch](https://www.wsj.com/articles/forget-the-officesalesforce-is-making-a-wellness-retreat-for-workers-11644510615?mod=article_inline). The fight for talent was so fierce that companies hoarded workers to keep them from their competitors, and some employees say they were effectively\u00a0[hired to do nothing](https://www.wsj.com/articles/these-tech-workers-say-they-were-hired-to-do-nothing-762ff158?mod=article_inline).\n\nA downturn quickly followed, as higher inflation and interest rates cooled the economy. Some of the largest tech employers, some of which had never done large-scale layoffs, started cutting tens of thousands of jobs.\u00a0\n\nThe payroll services company ADP started tracking employment for software developers among its customers in January 2018, observing a steady climb until it hit a peak in October 2019.\u00a0\n\nThe surge of hiring during the pandemic slowed the overall downward trend but didn\u2019t reverse it, according to Nela Richardson, head of ADP Research. One of the causes is the natural trajectory of an industry grounded in innovation. \u201cYou\u2019re not breaking as much new ground in terms of the digital space as earlier time periods,\u201d she says, adding that increasingly, \u201cThere\u2019s a tech solution instead of just always a person solution.\u201d\u00a0\n\nSome job seekers say they no longer feel wined-and-dined. One former product manager in San Francisco, who was laid off from Meta Platforms, was driving this spring to an interview about an hour away when he received an email from the company telling him he would be expected to complete a three-part writing test upon his arrival. When he got to the office, no one was there except a person working the front desk. His interviewers showed up about three hours later but just told him to finish up the writing test and didn\u2019t actually interview him.\u00a0\n\nThe trend of ballooning salaries and advanced titles that don\u2019t match experience has reversed, according to Kaitlyn Knopp, CEO of the compensation-planning startup Pequity. \u201cWe see that the levels are getting reset,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople are more appropriately matching their experience and scope.\u201d\n\nWage growth has been mostly stagnant in 2024, according to data from Pequity, which companies use to develop pay ranges and run compensation cycles. Wages have increased by an average of just 0.95% compared with last year. Equity grants for entry-level roles with midcap software as a service companies have declined by 55% on average since 2019, Pequity found.\n\nCompanies now seek a far broader set of skills in their engineers. To do more with less, they need team members who possess soft skills, collaboration abilities and a working knowledge of where the company needs to go with its AI strategy, says Ryan Sutton, executive director of the technology practice group with staffing firm Robert Half. \u201cThey want to see people that are more versatile.\u201d\n\nSome tech workers have started trying to\u00a0[broaden their skills](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ai-skills-tech-workers-job-market-1d58b2dd?mod=article_inline), signing up for AI boot camps or other classes.\u00a0\n\nMichael Moore, a software engineer in Atlanta who was laid off in January from a web-and-app development company, decided to enroll in an online college after his seven-month job hunt went nowhere. Moore, who learned how to code by taking online classes, says not having a college degree didn\u2019t stop him from finding work six years ago.\u00a0\n\nNow, with more competition from workers who were laid off as well as those who are entering the workforce for the first time, he says he is hoping to show potential employers that he is working toward a degree. He also might take an AI class if the school offers it.\u00a0\n\nThe 40-year-old says he gets about two to three interviews for every 100 jobs he applies for, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s not a good ratio.\u201d\n\n# Struggling at entry level\n\nTech internships once paid salaries that would be equivalent to six figures a year and often led to full-time jobs, says Jason Greenberg, an associate professor of management at Cornell University. More recently, companies have scaled back the number of internships they offer and are posting\u00a0[fewer entry-level jobs](https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/computer-science-majors-job-market-7ad443bf?mod=article_inline). \u201cThis is not 2012 anymore. It\u2019s not the bull market for college graduates,\u201d says Greenberg.\n\nMyron Lucan, a 31-year-old in Dallas, recently went to coding school to transition from his Air Force career to a job in the tech industry. Since graduating in May, all the entry-level job listings he sees require a couple of years of experience. He thinks if he lands an interview, he can explain how his skills working with the computer systems of planes can be transferred to a job building databases for companies. But after applying for nearly two months, he hasn\u2019t landed even one interview.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI am hopeful of getting a job, I know that I can,\u201d he says. \u201cIt just really sucks waiting for someone to see me.\u201d\u00a0\n\nSome nontechnical workers in the industry, including marketing, human resources and recruiters, have been laid off multiple times.\n\nJames Arnold spent the past 18 years working as a recruiter in tech and has been laid off twice in less than two years. During the pandemic, he was working as a talent sourcer for Meta, bringing on new hires at a rapid clip. He was laid off in November 2022 and then spent almost a year job hunting before taking a role outside the industry.\u00a0\n\nWhen a new opportunity came up with an electric-vehicle company at the start of this year, he felt so nervous about it not panning out that he hung on to his other job for several months and\u00a0[secretly worked for both companies](https://www.wsj.com/articles/these-people-who-work-from-home-have-a-secret-they-have-two-jobs-11628866529?mod=article_inline)\u00a0at the same time. He finally gave notice at the first job, only to be laid off by the EV startup a month later.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cI had two jobs and now I\u2019ve got no jobs and I probably could have at least had one job,\u201d he says.\n\nArnold says most of the jobs he\u2019s applying for are paying a third less than what they used to. What irks him is that tech companies have rebounded financially but some of them are relying\u00a0[on more consultants](https://www.wsj.com/articles/consultants-emerge-as-early-winners-in-generative-ai-boom-8df71d38?mod=article_inline)\u00a0and are\u00a0[outsourcing roles](https://www.wsj.com/articles/next-wave-of-remote-work-is-about-outsourcing-jobs-overseas-54af39ba?mod=article_inline). \u201cCovid proved remote works, and now it\u2019s opened up the job market for globalization in that sense,\u201d he says.\u00a0\n\nOne industry bright spot: People who have worked on the large language models that power products such as ChatGPT can easily find jobs and\u00a0[make well over $1 million](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/the-fight-for-ai-talent-pay-million-dollar-packages-and-buy-whole-teams-c370de2b?mod=article_inline)\u00a0a year.\u00a0\n\nKnopp, the CEO of Pequity, says AI engineers are being offered two- to four-times the salary of a regular engineer. \u201cThat\u2019s an extreme investment of an unknown technology,\u201d she says. \u201cThey cannot afford to invest in other talent because of that.\u201d\n\nCompanies outside the tech industry are also adding AI talent. \u201cFive years ago we did not have a board saying to a CEO where\u2019s our AI strategy? What are we doing for AI?\u201d says Martha Heller, who has worked in executive search for decades. If the CIO only has superficial knowledge, she added, \u201cthat board will not have a great experience.\u201d\u00a0\n\nKugelman, meanwhile, hung his last flier in May. He ended up taking a six-month merchandising contract gig with a tech company\u2014after a recruiter found him on LinkedIn. He hopes the work turns into a full-time job.\n\n  \n",

            "Tech investment follows trends. Before AI was the crypto bubble, before the crypto bubble was the cloud, before the cloud was e-commerce. Investment paid off until crypto wasted a LOT of money, and investors were rugged. They threw everything they had left at AI. Well, AI isn't really paying off now, either... if you knew what the next trend would be(nobody does.) and studied on it, you'd catch the next tech employment wave. Any bets on what that will be? I'm going in on embedded systems, smart devices, robotics, and automated systems. Get those C/QT certs and Django skills brushed up. That new microwave with a TV built into it isn't going to code itself! And the company making them needs a quick django website to market it. \"Smart\" refrigerators are back on the menu, and an oven that provides video feed over wifi is cooking. The reason I think this is because of interest rates dropping. Lots of debt holders are looking forward to the opportunity to refinance on value equity. This money will go towards lowering credit card debt, home improvement/renovations, luxury home appliances, luxury electronics, energy saving systems, vehicles, and computers. The thing is, no one trusts GE, Armana, Whirlpool, Samsung, Apple, Intel, Amazon... they are now mindful consumers with a wad of cash looking for a next generation product that will last. So, some investors are going to see the value in developing and producing a high-quality home appliance. This requires high-quality parts and medium quality developers. The problem is that medium quality c/embedded developers are older, harder to find, and probably already have cushy jobs at big systems companies. So, the pool is small, and these large systems companies have the money/equity to increase wages and hire new talent. Now it's a race to shotgun everyone with even a hint of programming experience, assess which hires are competent, and lay off the rest. Just like they did with every other tech \"boom\". I'm in the thick of it right now, and if you can simply manage packets with QT, parse a CSV, and edit an ini file in a console, you're a genius. Make it all web accessible, and you're a god.",

Sit down with your manager and any other stakeholders and explain your reasons for leaving and any changes you expect to happen as a result of agreeing to stay. I would also make sure the retention bonus doesn't have any sort of clawback hooks or a vesting schedule, and if it's the latter either get them to drop the vesting schedule or allow quarterly vesting of some kind. They're offering you more money, so get that money and make sure it's as permanent as possible as quickly as possible.\n\nFinally: remember, they're offering you this because you leaving is likely going to blow a pretty big hole in their department, so while it's in your best interest to make it worth your while, you're also \"marked\" and if they have to reduce staff for some reason you may be first in line for those reductions. They could be offering you this and all the while are searching for your replacement(s) with the intention of canning you once they feel they've found enough gullible folks to do your job.\n\nFinally finally: GET EVERYTHING IN WRITING. Whatever you negotiate or talk through, get that shit in writing and signed by the interested parties, and keep a copy for your records somewhere you have access to and they don't. Nothing counts for shit if it's not in writing.",

It sounds like they are really wanting to retain you and your skills, and sometimes they don\u2019t know until they get smacked in the face. I know people will say \u201cif they aren\u2019t already paying you and only reactively will upgrade your salary/position that\u2019s wrong\u201d but in startups it\u2019s easy to get buried since there can be very fast moving environments. \n\nIf you are considering staying with them I would negotiate the parameters of your job and be very clear about how it has affected your mental state. Make sure they know and can guarantee it. I\u2019d be asking about how they plan to tackle the cloud-related stuff or bring in cloud-specific engineers  so you can focus as much as possible on the domains you are supposed to be working on. Make it clear where you stand and that you CAN do that stuff but it\u2019s not what you were transitioned to do. \n\nI know startups kind of have the \u201cwear all the hats\u201d mindset at times but it sounds like your startup has some capacity to bring in specialized talent for some of the things - even in the small/mid-sized startup I work for (around 60-70 full time staff) there\u2019s occasional overlap but people tend to work in their lanes. \n\nAnd at the end of the day if they aren\u2019t willing to listen or the vibes are off, then trust your gut and move on.",

It's not worth it.\n\nIf you're young and you're all about getting that money now and build wealth for the future and you think you can handle the load given the new compensation... just keep an eye on your health. Burning out is dreadful for your career and future prospects: you won't want to work anymore, you'll end up hating and resenting everything you do no matter if it's in this company, another company, government, NGO or whatever.

And let's be honest I'm still getting good money.\n\nI would say consider the new place carefully, all the pros don't just come automatically with a lower pay, and you wouldn't want to switch to an equally stressful  position with less pay. It's hard to judge a work environment from the outside, and in most places responsibilities will grow with time, so even the first few months can still paint an incomplete picture. That said if everything checks out, I would choose to take a break and then switch. Done it before, twice.\n\nAnother point in favor of switching that might not resonate with everyone but I'll throw it out there: you already accepted a new job, and already gave notice.

Since you have experience as a full stack developer and the demand for those is quite a bit higher, you definitely stand a better chance with software engineering. \n\nLonger answer:\n\n\nML being very competitive is because not every company or product needs ML but tons of people are interested in it and go study PhDs for it. This is in contrast to general application software engineering, practically every company on the planet needs software applications and hires software engineers so the market is bigger and most people have just a bachelor\u2019s in computer science instead of a PhD in CS, Math or Stats.",

        "content": "Not my main account because I know some of my coworkers/friends browse this sub and would recognize me.  I just want to rant and encourage people to keep looking for remote jobs and make the transition if they can/prefer it.\n\nSo last week, after a year or so working from home, I had to go back (for the first time in my career) into the office. According to my company, we should work from the office because it will increase collaboration and people will perform better.  Bunch of bs, but I had no other choice at the moment.\n\nSo first things first, instead of waking up at 8:20 and join a useless meeting at 8:30, be on mute and proceed to go make my breakfast and take my dog for a walk,  I now have to wake up at 7, get properly dressed (no more comfortable clothes), make sure I have lunch and breakfast prepped, get on the highway, drive, get there at 8:15, mindless chit chat till 8:30, join the same useless meeting on zoom (with coworkers from around the globe, what's the f. point? ) and now I HAVE to/MUST pretend to pay attention to something that has no relation to what I work with because well, I got no more flexibility on my surrounding environment.\n\nAt home, I invested in a nice work setup. I have a nice chair, a stand-up desk, wireless keyboard/mouse/headphones, 2 monitors that I can adjust, plus a private kitchen to make my snacks, and teas.\n\nThe first time I went to the office and I saw the work environment I felt ridiculous. It's a fucking cubicle, with a shitty keyboard, mouse, and headset. The best part is that the cubicle doesn't have tall walls so I can literally see/hear everything, including other people's monitors.  The monitors, of course, are facing the hallway, so you can't see who's walking behind you, but whoever walks past you can freely see what you are doing.  Manager's dream.\n\nI also have to wait in line now if I want to make some tea or something, delightful.\n\nAt home, I am able to have a quiet environment and be super productive. When I get a card, depending on what it is, I can finish it in 2-4 hours, and then I can focus on doing something else for the rest of the day (learning/training, other meetings, or just not work at all since I was able to be productive).\n\nAt the office, because of being constantly watched, I became lazy just to have something to hold on to/last for the rest of the day. I also noticed that my team members do the same.  Also for me, IT IS EXTREMELY HARD to actually focus with a lot of background noise and as I mentioned above, because of the cubicles, every time someone gets up (every 10 mins), or gets a phone call, my attention is drawn to that and I lose what focus I had.\n\nThe company kept saying we will be more productive at the office. That's the opposite of what I am seeing. My team is now taking longer for cards, and the amount of time wasted in the office is ridiculous. The number of people, mindless walking around, chit-chatting in cubicles, going out for lunch/ coffee breaks just to fill in the time is a joke(nothing wrong with that IMO, but I'd rather do that at home).\n\nI loved having a private bathroom at my house. I can go and do whatever I want to do in peace. At the office, welcome to the shitty stalls and pooping side by side because, yes, I do love the smell of people farting in the morning.\n\nThe people that wanted to go back into the office, after a week of going to work and lunches and whatnot, started to mention some stuff during the stand-ups and I quote:\n\n\"Are you guys feeling more tired than usual?  I forgot I didn't enjoy the commute\"\n\n\"Man I forgot it sucked to have to prep a meal every day and wait in line in the cafeteria to reheat it\"\n\n\"I actually didn't realize I was saving money eating at home, I spent over 100 dollars last week on coffee and lunch\".\n\nAt home, after work, I could go for a jog right away or just go watch some Netflix and chill out.\n\nAt the office after a long, tiring day? Nope, get in the car, you are going to waste 40 minutes in stressful traffic to get home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am FUCKING glad, I am putting in my 2 weeks this Wednesday and going fully remote. I started looking 4 months ago when the company announced their plans because I was feeling that this office thing would be horrible. I tried it out and it just doesn't work for me.\n\nIf you are looking for a remote role, keep applying/interviewing, you will get something too.\n\nIf you like/prefer going to the office that is fine. I am not trying to say we should all be remote. Companies should offer FLEXIBILITY to let employees choose where to work from.\n\nWe have different personalities and different preferences. Just because some people enjoy going into the office (or because management needs control) doesn't mean everyone has to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am gladly never going to or near an office ever again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Went to the office for the first time in my life. I hated it and makes no sense to me.  Companies should let employees decide where to work from. If they can't offer that and make their employee's lives easier/better, they should/will lose all their talent to companies that do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 1: There seems to be a lot of people saying that I am entitled. For a bit of background, I started working a couple of years ago as a dishwasher and made my way to where I am right now. I never had an easy path nor a college degree (I am self-taught with a small coding Bootcamp).\n\nJust because I prefer having a better quality of life/work, doesn't mean I am entitled. Instead of bickering with each other about who works harder or whatever, we should focus on having a better quality of life and trying to make it the norm. If you are working 6 days a week and you feel proud, good for you but I don't want that for me.",

My work laptop was in my living room so whenever I'd walk by I'd be reminded of work and I may open it back up after hours and do more work until I'm ready to sleep. That was my biggest struggle but I've learned to have a dedicated area for working in my home that is also not a common area so I do not have to see my work laptop. I hope this becomes easier to do as time goes on.\n\nWith that said I was commuting almost 2 hours a day in total to the office. That's 10 hours a week of free time I was losing just to work in an open office and wear noise-canceling headphones for 8 hours a day. Was I more productive? Maybe by 20% at the most during office hours (but this was off-setted by me working extra at night time out of boredom) but it wasn't worth the trade-off and I believe I could be just as productive at home if I had an actual office and wasn't working in my living room on my couch along with getting more disciplined with distractions.",

Still, I get irrelevant meetings. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEither way, if we don't fight for location and time flexibility NOW, they will eventually drag us all back to commuting and warming seats 40 hours a week in cubes breathing recycled air, and filled with sugar and junk food, \\*all for less output\\*.\n\nIt boggles my mind. Possibly Delta will disrupt this madness, but otherwise, it's worth looking for a job that supports remote work and a flexible schedule, because we either make it happen now, or we'll miss this chance.\n\nLet them try to compete for top talent while denying us location and schedule flexibility.

They know good devs (and good workers of all kinds) are too smart to let this backslide now.   \n\nI work for a very large and long established company in entertainment.   I am not paid at FAANG level, or even close really, and remote work was always a struggle pre covid.  Now, my boss is starting a pilot program where my specific team will be enabled to work remotely as much as we want. I'll probably go in a few days a week once this covid stuff is done, cuz I love my team, and my drive is short, but the point is that I won't \\*have\\* to.. and I shouldn't have to, after proving to my boss, and the business, that it's not a productivity inhibitor.  Not long ago I was searching for my next step, but as long as my boss is fighting to support indefinite remote work, I'm not feeling as urgent about it.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't let them bring you back unless you want to and feel safe ladies and gents.

I can't see why anyone would choose to come into your office if there was any alternative, and your company will soon realize this after the talented people who can get other jobs leave.\n\nI don't think companies *have* to let employees choose where to work from. That legitimately is complicated from a management and HR perspective. BUT, if they only offer limited options they damn better be sure they're good options if they want talented folks to stick around.",

I had a lot of unproductive days where I couldn't get anything done because I had to wait on someone else. Couldn't do it! Plus, same as you OP, I was distracted by every call and conversation. Plus we sold office furniture so clients would walk past me all the time while I was trying to focus. \n\nI started job searching and applying for full remote positions and I am on week 2 of remote work!

            "This is the absolute best summary I have come across for why flexibility is so important. One person can see the above-described office environment as collaboration/team building while another sees it as a waste of time. I personally could not care less about being best friends with my coworkers, apart from those whom I really respect. Further, I can typically build those relationships well-enough via written/video channels versus wasting time in cubicle conversations. I can't tune other people out, so remote work is 5x more productive for me than on-site.\n\n\nThe only time I would recommend someone who works better 100% remotely to go on-site is if they want to stay in their current environment but advance into management. If the culture is on-site first, managing an on-site team 100% remotely is going to pose several challenges that will prevent you from being an effective leader.\n\n\nThe best compromise I see: find a company that empowers their employees to choose to work on-site, remote, or a hybrid.\n\n\nAddressing the argument that a company cannot sustain a blended environment, a lot of times this is absolutely correct! \n\n\nSolution: There are so many 100% distributed environments where you can excel without worrying about having to go in the office to be promoted.

            ">I am FUCKING glad, I am putting in my 2 weeks this Wednesday and going fully remote.\n\nCongratulations my random online friend.  I put my notice in almost 3 weeks ago, and I just started my full remote job on Monday.  It's amazing how many of the things you mentioned related to my own condition, granted by the time I left we hadn't heard any plans of making people go back full time.  There were rumors being made of people having to go in either once a week or once a sprint (the latter I would have been fine with, considering I live 10 minutes away from my old office), but I had a feeling there were some managerial types that were trying to get us all back in.  To make it worse, our building unleased the top floor (the one with the best view, of course) to the building owner, which meant that going back into the office we wouldn't even have a dedicated area for our team anymore.\n\nThe move for me wasn't just in going back though. Constant managerial chaos and role shifts, nonsense corporate bullcrap.  Bullcrap that interfered with our productivity and constantly made us step back and rework stuff.  They had just started a policy of nuking our non-prod databases weekly in order to minimize our Azure bills, but this particular policy was going to make our pipeline configurations absolute hell to maintain.  Our product was rocky as hell and was no where near being ready to release. Our team was constantly being redirected by new contracts on a supposedly maintainence-moded product, only me and one other person on an 8 person team was regularly working on the new product.  They'd promise discussions about our salaries, and when that came the just gave a flat 1.5% raise and expected us to be happy about it.\n\nSo I got tired of it all, responded to a recruiter that had been bugging me for over a month on a nearly weekly basis, figuring what the hell lets see what they got, and holy shit I think I found a golden goose.  The interviews went great, I got an offer the day after my second interview 5k over my asking salary, for a grand total of a 50% raise. Their health insurance is \\*\\*\\*excellent\\*\\*\\*.  Starting September first when my health insurance kicks in, I will have a plan that has no deductible with a low copay and a relatively low out of pocket max.  The business isn't uber-exciting, definitely not anything near a FAANG, but it actually looks like it's going to be a lot of fun with a bunch of interesting new challenges to work on.  The product itself is an internal tool used by their sales agents, who are all US based, which means I more than likely will never be woken up in the middle of the night to triage a prod issue.  My entire team and department are based out of the US, and any contractors have a strict requirement to adhere to our timezone business hours. My last job had an entire department based out of Poland, and I got fed up with being pinged in the middle of the night for noncritical questions.\n\nNeedless to say I'm a happy camper, and I know it's only been a few days, but I already feel like this may be a job I'm going to be happy to stay at for more than a few years.

Better but I almost slid into oncoming traffic one time during the winter, scared the \\*\\*\\*\\* out of me.\n\nShared bathrooms are pure agony and misery.\n\nI have eating issues and finding something I could bring to work to eat for lunch is a really difficult thing.  So I was grabbing fast food all the time. $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\n\nSo all the same problems, if somewhat less horrible.\n\nThen covid hit and it was time to work from home.\n\nPrivate bathroom, no commute, saved so much money on food and gas.  I found I wasn't quite so easily bored and worked longer before needing a break.\n\nWhen we went back to the office, masked. I asked if things might change now that we've shown we can work from home effectively.  Some wfh days would be great once in a while.  The answer was a definite no.\n\nThankfully(????) I was let go because covid went on so long the company ran out of money.",
            "I just accepted a new position that I'm hoping I can WFH part of the time.

It's not a deal breaker because this is a position with a company where I've been trying to get my foot in the door, it's a perfect second step up in the beginning of  career change, and the small team gave the impression of being awesome. WFH one to two days a week though would certainly make things easier and my dogs would love it. \n\nI see pros and cons to WFH and office work, but I have to say if I was a grunt in a cubicle, I'd want to WFH full-time. Certain jobs make office work pure misery, a la Office Space.\n\nI think it depends on how open minded and trusting managers are of their employees, and I think some of the examples in this thread, like 200+ employees quitting when the office said come back to the office, will lead to companies having to change their minds. Flexible and open minded companies will have a better chance of recruiting top talent from around the country because of WFH options and perks, AND save money on office real estate.

I worked for 5 years at a 100% remote job as my very first job and for the first 3 years it was great! in years 4 and 5 it became a drag.   The office mostly sucks for doing actual work! But I do value talking in person with my co-workers and at lunch and at the end of the day and I think 1 or 2 days a week is great for this. It also allows for meetings to be concentrated on in office days.\n\nIn my ideal world 1 day a week in the office would be great preferably Friday 100% dedicated to meetings group conversations etc.\n\nI would quit a job where all I ever did was close tickets.

            "I just found your post! And I have to say yes, yes, yes! I agree with everything you said. The thing I don\u2018t understand is how we went from our companies trusting us at home (because they had to but didn\u2019t seem to complain\u2019 to \u2018we\u2019re going to continue this because y\u2019all are doing so great at home\u2019 to \u2018we don\u2019t trust you anymore, please come back to the office where we can see you\u2019. Wtf?\n\nI joined my company at the start of 2022 when things were still mostly remote with a flexible one day a week. Well, cut to 2024 where that is now mandatory, we have to scan a QR code to prove we\u2019re at the office, and now they\u2019re counting our days. Like seriously?! \n\nSurely as long as the work gets done who gives an actual f*ck where it\u2019s done?! I definitely do more productive work at home because I feel more relaxed. As soon as I go to an office I clench up, I get a stomach ache and a head ache. Maybe it\u2019s to do with the toxic work environment I\u2019m in plus the pressure from above to \u2018behave\u2019, but those things aside, I still resent having to go out of my way to sit in an uncomfortable environment to do the same job as I would at home. Why? The aircon is always too cold, there is never enough room in the fridge, the desks are too high, there\u2019s never a keyboard available, the lighting is awful for my tmj disorder\u2026 I could go on.\n\nI get that some jobs have to be done at a place of work. But I\u2019m speaking for the people who can do their job at home and love it. Why should we have to go back to the office?\n\nWhat I hate about today\u2019s society is that it\u2019s always one way or the highway. The office lovers want to go back so they\u2019re making everyone go back. How the f*ck is that fair? What about the people who fell in love with remote work? Sure we\u2019ll come in for a workshop or an important meeting. But every week just so the big boss can feel good and powerful? F*ck that, I say. Give everyone a choice and nobody will complain. That is literally all we\u2019re asking for. But no, of course, the higher ups are still stuck in the  nineties. \n\nThe extra stress and admin that comes with having to justify not coming to the office or having to make days up because you were ill or on holiday, or even the crappy platforms corporations use for employees to even book a desk\u2026 it\u2019s all a loada bother I could do without. I have my own problems. \n\nI think if my work environment was more positive, I\u2019d be more willing to go to the office but my boss hates me and so do the other two in the department. Yesterday, I had to sit through 45 minutes of my boss just giving me negative feedback on the tiniest of details from two weeks ago. Do you think I\u2019m gonna wanna hang with you in the kitchen after that? No thanks, pass, I\u2019d rather not trigger myself and constantly face the urge to throw staples at my boss\u2019 head. And most of the people I work with daily are in other cities. So again I ask: what is the f*cking point?\n\nAlso let\u2019s talk about the prep. The f*cking prep. You gotta pack all your tech stuff, then your lunch, pack your favourite tea or coffee because the shit at the office is absolute garbage, then you gotta iron a professional outfit, you gotta wake up earlier, leave the house, and then you gotta do the commute - the f*cking commute - probably to an office in the middle of nowhere with nothing near it. Then you have to do the same job as you would at home - with a lot more boredom involved because you can\u2019t go walk your dog in your spare gaps of time. Or watch a spot of TV (come on, we all do it). Then you gotta commute home with all the other sad f*cking commuters who also are thinking the same thing as you: what the actual f*ck am I doing?! Also I am tired. \n\nThe whole thing is puppet theatre. It\u2019s not real. Don\u2019t believe the lies. It\u2019s all about the fact that these egotistical companies want a presence in a given country or city to show they exist. To make it worthwhile you know what you need? Some employees, right! Guess who probably doesn\u2019t follow RTO policy? The big bosses, correct! \n\nThe amount of stress I get from this obligation that clearly doesn\u2019t align with my way of working  is unbelievable. I would quit tomorrow if I could. If the company hadn\u2019t started mandatory office days, I would probably not be complaining right now. I\u2019d be chilling. Happy. But the sheer fact that I am being forced to go somewhere to do the same thing in an office as I would at home just makes me miserable. What are we, school kids? Are we so untrustable that you have to watch us? Also word to the wise, if you have to force people to come, maybe explore why! Maybe you\u2019ll see that people don\u2019t want to come every week! So yeah, you can tell that I am NOT a fan of companies implementing mandatory office days, and I will be looking for a remote job. They do exist and I will get one!\n\nIf you hate the office and are thinking of taking a hybrid job, don\u2019t do it unless you\u2019re desperate. Hybrid isn\u2019t hybrid anymore. I\u2019m lucky I only have a one a day a week situation (I will admit that); one day a week gives me a headache - I couldn\u2019t imagine what three days a week would be like and I don\u2019t want to! be a They\u2019ll be guilt-tripping you into the artificial lighting soon enough.",

Afterwards I worked as a fullstack developer and a senior frontend developer for only 6 months and fired me during the trial phase because they were unhappy with my performance.  \n  \n I am aware how bad that looks in my resume and it's probably why a lot of companies don't bother inviting me to interviews. I do enjoy programming and IT, but dont really enjoy or am motivated in web dev and fullstack to be honest (which is most likely what caused me to perform sub par in the first place. I feel lie machine learning or data science would be more interesting for me to get into, but I am afraid I would have even worse chances getting into that currently since I dont have any work experience there and my resume in general. \n\nSo what should I do? Try to get any role as a fullstack dev with my experience and try to stay there for at least a few years while learning machine learning on the side so my resume looks good again and I dont have too long of a break between jobs, or just try to learn (and do stuff like leetcode or showable projects?), could that be enough to get into machine learning if you dont have work experience there? Maybe do online/evening university in that field so I actually have a degree to show that I can work in that field and just do anything I can get until then?\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated, thank you.",

I did both my BSc. and MSc. in the Netherlands, and after graduating I, like many of you, struggled for many months to find work. I started a job a few months ago at a Dutch company, and I thought I'd share some comparisons and differences for you all, whether you're considering studying abroad or even trying to find work abroad. \n\nSome high-level notes:\n\n- I had about 1 YoE if you include an internship + 1.5 years of part-time experience at a company during grad school.\n- My title is Data Engineer but my specialty is data science, particularly deep learning and time series forecasting.\n- I work \"40 hours a week\" but in reality I'm completely flexible, so long as I get my work done. I know that many in my team work closer to 32-36 hour weeks, though they're not explicit about it (at least not with me). My manager works 40-50 hour weeks but he's an excellent programmer who seemingly really enjoys his job, and he claims he just works on weekends because he wants to. He's unmarried and in his 30's, though.\n- My total compensation is \u20ac4500/mo, 14x per year. It's very common in NL to get a \"13th month\" which is essentially a free extra month of pay after 12 months of employment. Depending on company, it happens in either May or November. Additionally, I get paid two full months of pay in December. As such, the total compensation is 4500 x 14 = \u20ac63000,  or about $66,500. I do not get any stock as the company is privately held.\n- The company pays for 100% of my commute, either via public transit or the gas I spend driving a vehicle (I don't own a car)\n- I get 25 days paid vacation with 1 extra paid vacation day per quarter that I don't get sick, but I've been told that it's essentially \"unlimited\" vacation so long as you don't screw anyone over and are doing good work. Many senior individuals in this company get closer to 40 days, they've told me the company ramps up PTO quickly with seniority. \n- Our company is officially \"3 in-person, 2 remote\" but in reality its more like 1 in-person, 4 remote. Depends on the team member. I prefer in-person more than remote, but some days I just wake up late or it's raining hard and I don't feel like going to the office. Nobody cares at all.\n- The company has about 3000 employees, but it's not a tech company. Every product we create is exclusively internal.\n- We are agile in 2-week sprints. \n\nand my favorite:\n\n- If I get sick, the first 2 weeks I get 100% of my pay. Weeks 3-52 (yes, fifty two) I get 90% of my pay. Weeks 53-208 I get 80% of my pay. After 4 years of being sick and unable to work, I have to go onto a government program. I cannot be fired for not being able to work if I get sick or injured. \n\n---\n\nHaving most of my American friends and family in similar fields (engineering of some kind) I hear just awful things about almost everyone's companies. Dismissive managers, 10-15 days paid vacation per year, grindset mentality with strict supervision on hours, micromanaging everything, and having to be on-call or otherwise getting calls after hours, I definitely don't feel like I'm missing out compared to the States. I make about 25%-50% less than I'd make in the US (depending on city) but I can pay all of my bills and save at least \u20ac1000/mo while living a very comfortable lifestyle, and my \"emergency fund\" doesn't really have to be that big because:\n\n- I cannot get fired or laid off except in very dire circumstances (some discussion in the comments about this, but employment is not at-will here).\n- I basically cannot get evicted if I'm unable to pay due to work/health issues, so I'll never be homeless. \n- My medical bills will never be above \u20ac385/year because that's the annual deductible for my health insurance policy that covers 100% of everything, everywhere.\n- I don't ever need to own a car, and even if I want to I can get a free car through my job, which is common in NL, so I will never be cut off from work due to a car malfunction issue. \n\nI don't think I'll stay here forever, but I definitely feel like I could do several more years here at least before thinking about returning to the USA. I've always enjoyed the Dutch vibe and the more relaxed attitude people have here, but at some point my earning potential will likely just be much higher in the States once I am a bit more experienced, so who knows how I'll feel in a few years.",

In EU, changing companies or getting promotion will bring you couple hundreds \u20ac per month. \n\nWorking in EU means stable and stress free life with earning okayish money. in US, your income will be higher but you will need to deal with lots of stress and uncertainty (in terms of work)",

            "I mean, personally I\u2019m still happy I\u2019m a dev in the US. I say that as someone who did a short 2.5 month stint in Eindhoven, and moved to the US from Canada.\n\nIn terms of health insurance, it\u2019s almost always included for developers, so you can\u2019t really call that a benefit for the NL.\n\nCommute? Not uncommon to have some portion covered. My company gives $135/month which is a common amount as it\u2019s the most the IRS allows tax free\n\nFood? I get free breakfast and lunch, if I choose to come in.\n\nRemote? I voluntarily go in once a week.\n\nSick day? Most companies are pretty flexible for developers. I get 10 days at my current place. 5-10 seems pretty common for official policy but it\u2019s usually dependent on manager.\n\nVacation? Yeah NL is the clear winner. 3 weeks seems to be standard in the US. Personally I get 5, but that\u2019s not the norm.\n\nJob security? Yeah, NL wins.\n\nWLB? Eh, that\u2019s also a wash. WLB varies quite significantly. I\u2019ve personally worked for a company that I got by on 20 hours a week, but now I need to work about 45.\n\nPay though, oh boy. A random tax calculator says63k EUR is  43.8k EUR / 47k USD after tax, which really isn\u2019t a lot. According to the bureau of labour and statistics the median pay for software developers in the US was 127k which is 96k after tax in Seattle or 88k in California.\n\nThe ceiling is also waaaaay higher in the US. Most big tech jobs in Seattle, SF, and New York pay 150-350k for intermediates and 300-600 for senior. If you land one of those jobs it\u2019s hard to say the US isn\u2019t great for SWEs\u2026",

Although I don\u2019t doubt it\u2019s still probably much more competitive than yours.\n\nNow: \n- Healthcare situation is much worse here, even though my insurance is great it\u2019s very annoying navigating the healthcare system here\n- It\u2019s much easier for me to be let go or fired\n- I\u2019ll eventually do need to get a car, transit in my city is okay, but not amazing and it come in my way sometimes\n- I can\u2019t even start to think about childcare, I\u2019ve had coworkers spend over a grand a month in childcare.

My money is on the EU collapsing faster, though I'm for sure going to see what happens in the 2024 election before making any long-term decisions.\n\nI've talked a lot about the peace of mind of the healthcare situation, but I don't want to overlook the fact that *I literally cannot lose my job* unless the company goes under, and even so the company must continue to support their employees before paying off investors. The minimum severance is 90 days, which is similar to California. After 90 days, they still need to pay for my health insurance (I believe for up to a year). If the company does not go bankrupt, they cannot fire me except for the absolute most egregious offenses. Getting PIP'd here is not a common occurrence.\n\nA fun little tidbit: the Dutch word for debt (\"schuld\") is the same as for \"shame\" or \"guilt\". Credit cards basically don't exist at all here, and for the overwhelming majority of individuals, the only debts they have are for housing and student loans (which up until recently have been at 0% interest).

I recently switched to C# after 7 years working with PHP and I love it.\n\nIAmTimCorey and kudvencat on YT have incredible videos covering most everything you'll need. kudvencat has full, 100+ video tutorials from start to finish covering everything from C#, to Linq, to .net framework, to .net core, to entity framework, etc, etc. Small, easily digestible videos packed full of info. I highly recommend it.\n\nThe crowds over at r/csharp and r/dotnet are great as well\n\nE - Clearly, you'll need to pair this with the typical web stack basics like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. With development experience, you shouldn't have any trouble picking up the fundamentals of these. If you're feeling saucy, dabble with React. It's extremely desirable now.\n\nWeb development can be pretty overwhelming when entering the field, just due to the sheer amount of skills you need to acquire, but it's a blast once you break through that barrier.",
            "In general, unless you have 10 years or more of industry experience, your resume should not be more than a single pager. I would heavily consolidate your information to be much shorter and easier to digest. Recruiters get hundreds of resumes to sift through and if yours is short and sweet it's more likely they'll actually read the information presented. I wouldn't want to read this wall of text if I were a recruiter.\n\nAnother thing that will help greatly is putting concrete numbers to your achievements/experiences. As an example, using one of your bullet points instead of saying \n\n    \"Developed prototype software to detect and count cars in a video stream\"\n\nPut a value to this, as the facts and figures stand out to the eye when skimming a resume. Say something like:\n\n    \"Developed prototype software for detection of cars which increased tabulation efficiency by 30%\"\n\n(this number is made up, just an example so you know what i mean)\n\nAnother general rule I've been told for along time was the 5x5, no more than 5 bullet points and no more than 5 words per bullet point. I usually go over 5 words per bullet point but I think you DEFINITELY need to reduce the number of things you have for each of your work experiences.\n\nEDIT #1: also remove your name and contact information from the second page IF YOU MUST HAVE A SECOND PAGE AT ALL. The recruiter already has that info from your application/online submission/first page of the resume so having it on there twice is just a waste of space.\n\nEDIT #2: also, remove irrelevant work experience. You're trying to get strictly into a software dev position, so I think the Hardware Engineer and Design Engineer work experience can be deleted from your resume altogether. If a recruiter asks about what you were doing for work at that time, you can explain in person or over email what you were doing at the time so they don't think you were bumming around doing nothing.\n\nThat's all I've got, good luck!\n\nCredibility: I am a business major with a Computer Information Systems degree and will be starting as an entry software dev at a large company later this month.

        "title": "Addressing the whole \"AI will replace us\" concern",
        "content": "Seems like we can't even go at least one or two days without somebody bringing up the notion that at some point in the near future, all of our jobs are going to be replaced with AI. Designers, writers, developers, researchers, etc.\n\nI've stated in so many ways how the AI isn't there yet to be able to completely do things the way we do. Not to mention the fact that the stakeholders and employers that would love to get rid of all of their human labor are also the same people that can't clearly articulate what they want, so I can imagine while the AI could be very intelligent, it might not be able to translate the mess a stakeholder would give as instruction. \n\nNow I'm going to take this out to a bigger level. If AI could replace a software engineer completely, or a graphic or web designer completely, then that means the AI is intelligent enough to replace a lot of people. Why should finance companies hire wealth managers and stockbrokers and other financial gurus when the AI could simply go out and quickly analyze and figure out what to buy and what to sell immediately without any worry?\n\nWhy should we even have any other kinds of engineers if the AI can simply quickly draw up blueprints and then use a 3D printer to turn out a prototype?\n\nAnd then of course, there's the people that bring up their vocational trade, pretending that somehow they will never be replaced and they will always make loads of money forever.\n\nWhat happens if we end up with millions of displaced knowledge workers, and at least a fourth of them decide to go out and learn vocational trades so they can make a living? That means you're now going to have a lot more competition out there, and they're going to be undercutting you, and now you're going to complain that you can't find decent paying work. Isn't this the same complaint I hear about migrants coming in?\n\nLet's be brutally honest. If AI could come and replace all of us very quickly, and now human labor has become obsolete, this is not going to just become an issue of where you're going to work, it's going to become an issue of how does society survive. If it comes to the point that there's really no work out there for you beyond retail or some other menial labor that is likely going to be replaced with robots, then that means that you are now obsolete. That the only option for you is to find a nice place to curl up and starve to death.\n\nAnd how do companies make money if nobody has any income or money to spend on anything?\n\nLet's be brutally honest, society isn't going to go there. And Lord knows if the AI is intelligent enough, then somebody could replace the board with the AI. We could replace our government elected officials with AI. That means anybody could be replaced with AI.\n\nIt's a tool. I would tell anyone out here that you should be trying to figure out how to utilize it in your work. I know for me, I'm slapping my forehead today thinking that I should be running content. Then I'm writing for company emails through chat GPT just to see if they can improve on it. I'm using generative AI with Adobe products to do certain kinds of retouching that it would take me hours to do on my own. I'm not necessarily going to let AI completely lay out a web page for me, but I'm not going to sit here being scared of it as if it's going to make me irrelevant.\n\nI'm sorry for those out there who can't find a job. It sucks, but I will tell you I've been through this thing after the dotcom crash, watched many more go through it after the housing crash in 2008. This is unfortunately a transitional time in our economy, and everyone's going to have to suffer a little bit until everything settles down and we figure out what the new normal is. I will tell you though, that if you believe everything is so absolutely hopeless right now, then you're pretty much screwed in life. \n\nSo take a deep breath, stop being afraid of AI, start figuring out how to better utilize it in your work, and keep at it because eventually these companies are going to have to hire again. They can't sit on their hands forever because the shareholders will start demanding why they are not making new revenue.\n\nIf you are a beginner or a junior or somebody that came out of a boot camp with minimal skills, you had better be working on those skills while you are sitting here applying for jobs. Put down the Xbox controller and look for things you can do to build on your skills. Network with people who are working and don't ask them to give you a job or an internship, but ask them what skills they are seeing that everyone is lacking that you should be working on. \n\nI know if someone asked me that in UX, I would be happy to try to point out what I think they should be doing. I may not have jobs or internships to give out, but the very least I can do is give out advice.\n\nThings will get better. Calm down. ",

I'm not worried about the entire career becoming obsolete just yet. If you guys think the industry is saturated in the state it's in now then you guys are going to be so fucking blown away and even more depressed when you see how teams are going to shrink and shrink because AI as a tool is going to make it so 2-3 devs can do the work of 10.

It still (mostly) works because even though we hollowed out our manufacturing sector and created a new class of indentured servants, we left enough people making enough money to sustain the demand for goods and services. An AI that could replace - actually replace - a software dev ends that because that same AI could replace not just software devs but also any other discipline with a similar cognitive load, plus *everything beneath that.* That ends our economy. Not just an economic sector; it ends it as a whole.\n\nI don\u2019t think people understand this; the advent of an AI that can *truly* replace a human software dev is a civilization ending event; it sweeps all the pieces off the board.",

Even if they get a million a year salary, the companies will still be saving hundreds of millions of dollars from labor, which I think is a very real possibility. \n\nAnd no AI isn\u2019t good enough yet but it\u2019s getting better at an exponential rate. It\u2019s the first time AI has become \u201csmarter\u201d than the average human in history. Look at how much Sora improved in a year.

            "Disclaimer: I posted part of this on another thread, so it's essentially leftovers.  I had just started using AI four months ago, and so I wasn't really prepared for its, as Pantera would say, 'Vulgar Display of Power'.  Edited the text so that it would make sense.  The other post was on a graphic design sub, but it's relevant here, even four months out.  \n  \nLet's not forget that AI is in its absolute infancy.  Give it a year.  Hell, if you go to that \"this person does not exist\" website, apart from a very few mistakes once in a while, the images generated are indistinguishable from a photograph.  Even then you'd damn near have to launch a forensic investigation.\n\nSo while AI is in its proverbial Model T form, if it's able to produce images that are absolutely believable and solve complex problems and 'learn' from them, then graphic design and most creative endeavors as a career are over.  I have a startup where literally every single operation, from invoicing/billing to customer retention, marketing, data analysis (determining on a daily basis which sectors/product classes of the website are performing poorly and then producing a marketing piece and campaign to address that deficiency) and order management is being done by AI.  It's all at once shocking and cool and more than a little frightening.  I started it up for my teenaged children to be able to take over so that they don't get sidelined...by AI and the coming de-industrialization and de-employment of the entire planet.  Don't forget that about 10 years ago, it was widely predicted that 25% to 50% of the world's population will be unemployed by 2030.  \n  \nAgain, this is the Model T version.  This is the 'bare minimum', hyper-controlled/edited/garbage-in-garbage-out version of the software that companies that are largely aligned with global big business and mainstream globalist politics 'approve' for general use by the general public.  It's going to be a crisis of civilization in about two to three years when this cat gets out of the bag and people are actually able to exploit its full potential on their own, without interference from any powers that be.  Humans, myself included in my consulting business, are going to be unnecessary: no, we're going to be irrelevant - and ultimately a hinderance to AI, which in the next few years will have a sort of sentience beyond what it has now, which is clearly artificial and sometimes a little cringe.    \n  \nAnyone pretending that we're not headed for that iceberg is absolutely fooling themselves.

        "content": "I spent close to 2 years in a well established mid sized tech company after my bachelor's in CS. I loved coding. I enjoyed solving Codeforces problems and I loved learning algorithms.\n\nBut my work never involved a single \"Algorithm\" or \"Leetcode\" related task ever. I was programming in React and JavaScript and literally never understood the depths of stuff like render cycle or promises or whatever was required for my job. Whenever I had to write basic components, I knew what to do and got it done. Whenever I got to a certain bug, or some kind of an authentication issue, or build failure, I absolutely hated it. On top of that, I never understood how to bloody write tests. I never understood what's with mocks or wrappers or whatever this entire domain requires. I somehow got stuff done because I had a friend who helped me at work and always knew a way out.\n\nI interviewed for another company to take a step back and see how good I was at interviews. I nailed the leetcode rounds because I'm good at that. When it came to writing a React component, I literally had so many issues with syntax and errors which made me realize; I copy pasted react/JavaScript code for 2 years without even learning the basic syntax. I was so embarrassed because I came in to the interview with my \"years of exp\" and I fumbled so badly.\n\nTaking another step back, I realized that every project I had done in my life, was always something I wrote from scratch. I never really contributed to open source or got my feet wet with REAL codebases because I just felt like it was \"too complicated.\"\n\nThis whole thing of leetcode being used as a reference point for someone's engineering abilities may have fucked me over to think I'm good at engineering, but I'm not.\n\nI understand the overall architecture and engineering at a decent level. When I need to look at code to FIX it, I have no interest. And making that shift from one tech stack to another, learning new technologies and new languages just seems so boring. I don't even know what the fuck goes on during builds, or code splitting, or pipeline or whatever terms you toss at me. I don't want to go that deep and figure out why things are/aren't working.\n\nMy ego got in the way of my career. I thought I was good at programming. No. I'm good at algorithms and leetcode. I'm not good at software engineering.\n\nI'm thinking of making a career transition into something like technical product management or whatever. I have an exterior understanding of software. I like problem solving. Maybe I'm good at strategies? I always think of things that can go right/wrong and I'm cautious of different aspects. I noticed that specific aspect in me while gaming.

            "I have the literal opposite problem. I never studied DSA and can't leetcode to save my life, but I am an expert in troubleshooting and fixing broken code or finishing something I don't understand in the slightest. I have the same imposter syndrome you have, in an ideal world we could give each other everything we know and be twice the developer we both are. What you need are methodologies to bail you out when you are stuck. I have developed troubleshooting methodologies from years of doing everything from HVAC to building agricultural robots. Some of these may not apply to you considering you are a web dev and I am embedded / robotics but here is a list of everything I do.\n\nStart at power: May seem obvious but the first thing you check when something isn't working at all is power, do the old off / on again or even literally take a meter to the power connection to check it.\n\nTake measurements: whether they are electrical measurements or timing measurements or print statements. Find a way to test different parts of your system for bottlenecks and to make sure code is being activated.\n\nFind a comparable system: find something extremely similar to what you are trying to do and understand what it is doing.\n\nReview documentation: read all source documentation you can find related to the problem, there are many nuggets of wisdom that won't be obvious that can be hidden in the documents.\n\nGoogle the problem: lol oldie but Goldie always Google that shit.\n\nIsolate parts of system and develop tests: find way to test individual parts of the system to assure what you are trying to do is being done, they call this unit testing I believe but it is a skill that takes time to get good at.\n\nReview your assumptions: if you designed something to work and it isn't working, you very well could be making a wrong assumption somewhere. Check all your assumptions without ego.\n\nUse version control: constantly using version control allows you to test different parts of a system in a roundabout way, you can think you are fixing something, somewhat fix it, then break it again and have nothing to go back to. Version control helps you fix that.\n\nInspect visually and check all connections: for physical devices this is far more important also known as the wiggle test, I am sure there is some web dev version of this with endpoints or something idk.\n\nStay calm, do not get emotional: Never get too attached to an idea or fixing something in a certain way, it can completely blind you to the real issue and end up making you look foolish.\n\nCut things in half: cut you data, arrays, memory whatever in half, this can allow you to find many problems related to bottlenecks, overflows and other issues. It is a general rule that has served me very well when I have been stuck.\n\nGuess and check: just start changing stuff that you think may be relevant, this coupled with version control can allow you to gather the information required to isolate the problem.\n\nFind all information related to the system: software version, compliers, language version, what system it is running on etc, this lets you find the once in a while odd ball problem many other engineers don't look for.\n\nAsk for help: even if the other person doesn't help you directly, this can inspire new ideas and bring other viewpoints into the problem.\n\nKeep track of ideas surrounding the problem: write them down, keep a list in notepad++ whatever. Keep track of your thoughts on the issue and review it. I have all these things written in a notebook I keep in my bag, Every time I solve a new problem I write it down.\n\nThere are more things I have on my list but it's longer than I remember and much of it isn't applicable to you so I won't list them all here, just understand everyone has a different set of skills. Work on your weaknesses but play into your strengths, what different companies want is completely random. All these things have served me well in the past but seem foreign to many SWEs I have dealt with.

I find that's the case in most people, and they just have to be shown how it works or dig in a little bit more to the fundamentals. \n\nIn terms of React, I think the FrontendMasters course on React does a great job of explaining what problems React solves for you in a way that's not overwhelming. They also have authentication courses, and Pluralsight and similar places also have things. Sometimes it's a little easier to spend a little time in that than digging in yourself, especially when you're not sure where to start. \n\nFeel free to reach out for questions or guidance if you want and I can see if I can help. \n\nSide note - I'm guessing you prorastinate some, and all it really is is your brain wanting to avoid things that cause negative emotions. Not knowing how to do something causes a negative emotion. Software Engineering is *hard* and pays well for a reason. \n\nYou have to retrain your brain to approach the problems differently where not knowing something can be a positive, or at the very least have a strategy for what you do when these situations occur. Something like a checklist. \n\n* Do I understand what's supposed to happen? \n* Is it doing the thing I expect it to? \n* Am I sure that it is because I saw it happen while debugging, or am I assuming it is because that's what I think the code is doing?\n* Have I read the documentation for examples?\n* Have I created the most basic working solution possible for this scenario in a separate small project (like a quickstart or tutorial)?\n\nThis is basic, but modify it to fit your need. If you're working on troubleshooting an issue that spans your whole system, you might add some steps. I know you probably feel overwhelming in general, but having a strategy to tackle these things takes away a bit of the unknown parts. It's overwhelming to look at a problem and say I don't even know what to do here. You start with the checklist so you're working on smaller problems rather than the whole big problem and do small pieces at a time.",

There are many other jobs out there that pay well and that you could find enjoyment with. \n\nYour degree is not wasted because it demonstrates that you can be disciplined and apply yourself for a lengthy period of time. Maybe look into other less technical jobs but still related to the field for example scrum master and the certifications that go along with it, or product manager,  etc",
            "OP - you sound exactly like me 3 years back. When I transitioned to a \"real\" engineering company where I had to build services and write frameworks from scratch or build on other people's work, I was totally lost. I considered myself good at coding as I equated LC to real coding but reality of eng work is far far different. \nHere's what I'd suggest(which worked for me)- \nfirstly, take it slow. You're just 2 years into the industry. As you're already interested in LC, I feel you'll eventually like software engineering as well. Your current \"hate\" towards eng or unwillingness to learn is likely coming from the fact that you're displeased with your perf.\n\nGet a senior engineering mentor in your team or sister team that can comment on your work directly. Catch hold of him/her and get your code/designs reviewed diligently and request aggressive feedback. \n\nWhile doing this, participate in every single code/design review that you can get your hands on. It can be totally unrelated to your tech stack but take this opportunity to understand the choices. Use these sessions to understand the thought process behind a certain class, design choices, why use this over that etc.. Comment during live reviews, pull requests, design docs, oncall etc.. Chat or setup calls 1-1 with other person and try being the devil's advocate. Remember that our goal is to learn the best, absorb the other person's expertise and eventually build something like them. Dig to the very deep until you REALLY understand the barebones. The end goal here- you should be able to explain this design or code with clarity to someone outside your team independently and even answer their questions. In the process, you can sound ignorant when asking trivial questions but that's totally fine and acceptable for a rising engineer.\n\nThis approach is certainly time consuming. It might look like you're not making any progress. But trust me, with diligent progress, you'll start seeing results. Continue doing this over the first 5 years of your career and you'll reap in leaps and bounds later. Best wishes!",

            "You're discovering the difference between solving little self-contained coding problems and real world software engineering. Most code is edited 10-20 times more often than it is written. And all of the non-glamorous stuff you mention, bugs, authentication, concurrency, mock testing, etc. is an essential part of getting software to production. You will have to develop a knack for recognizing and fixing things like poor syntax (though IDE's and copilots help with that these days). Troubleshooting and bug fixing is its own completely separate skill and discipline. It's like cooking an omelette vs. running a restaurant.\n\nBut you are definitely far from the first person that finds that heads-down coding is not for them. If you ask around to your product and people leaders you will find that many of them started out as coders and found it wasn't for them. I talked to one business person that said they spent 2 hours staring at a block of code until they realized there was a misplaced comma and that was the last time they did any coding. Doing enough coding to understand how it works allows people in those roles to relate to the engineering in a way that non-coders can't so that can be valuable.",

I'm not good at software engineering.\n\nAt your level of experience this is normal. Very few CS programs have a serious focus on software engineering as a discipline and a lot of CS grads are expected to develop those skills within industry.\n\n>I'm thinking of making a career transition into something like technical product management or whatever\n\nI would consider whether or not you have a similar viewpoint of these other roles that you had with the software engineer roles, i.e. your assumption of what the role demands of you is fundamentally wrong and so your expectations will be misaligned with what the role expects. I would suggest that you ask yourself what it is you actually want to do, and figure out if there are roles that actually line up with that. You sound like you like to hack together working solutions for customers quickly, which are the core skills for consulting and sales engineer roles.\n\nSales engineering and solutions architect roles are interesting because a company selling services along side their products will need to train a set of skilled programmers to present solutions to customers who want to leverage the product solution but don't have the internal staff to actually leverage it without some support. As a sales engineer your concern is primarily the customer's level of understanding, and not the deeper level the engineers who develop the product have. Typically sales engineers are a bit of a dry-run for product documentation and tend to be the first to file bugs before the product hits customers. Often a sales engineer will be guided around how a product is intended to be used and how it can be customized, and isn't necessarily expected to have a deep understanding of a system.\n\nSales engineers are often entitled to a portion of the commission of the sale, depending on how compensation is structured. However, the current labor market isn't favoring sales-centric roles, so while this may be a good fit for your career interests there may not be an abundance of open roles at the moment outside of the AI startup world.",

I am self-taught and have a degree in a different field. Back in my home country, I supported myself through a combination of remote freelance and full-time positions, focusing mainly on UI development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Angular.\n\nJust before moving to Canada, I decided to transition to iOS development. I quit my last real job (4 years ago) and jumped into learning mobile development. The pandemic provided plenty of time to study, and I completed several online courses, the most significant being the iOS Developer certificate from Meta, which took six months. I built some projects and spent two years at a startup designing, developing, and launching a social media app. Then I built more projects, and still doing it.\n\nSince moving to Canada, I have struggled to secure any tech interviews for both web and mobile positions. Initial screening calls often ended with feedback that companies were seeking 'someone more experienced'. I couldn\u2019t land any freelance gigs either, despite competing for low-rate projects. I never imagined that years of hard work and real experience would count for next to nothing in the job market. It's disheartening to think that I haven't earned a single dollar for the last 4 years after nearly a decade in tech.\n\nThis situation is astounding for people like me. I never aspired to be a prodigy who solves complex algorithms on breakfast, but it seems that\u2019s what companies are looking for. I don\u2019t need a $200k salary; I just want an opportunity to secure a tech job for any salary that is close to market average. Now it's more about having stuck in a dead-end after years of trying to solve this huge problem. Looks like I tried everything - applied more than thousand times worldwide, including WITCH companies, including Senior, Mid, Jr. and internship positions, completed expensive courses, finished local bootcamp, applied to startups, got into an unpaid startup for 2 long years and justified it as a good experience, created my own big project which is a cross-platform app and spent 2 more years on making it perfect, churned LC. The worst part is that I see all this as wrong decisions. It all seem to me like a big fucking mistake and waste of time. Any decision that I do in this environment ends up as a wrong decision.

            "Echoing some of the other comments in here, security is generally not a good career if you just want a job or are not super passionate about it. There is a super high barrier to entry, and a lot of people spend a lot of time doing it, so it can be hard to be competitive otherwise. For context, when I was in university, most people would spend 20-40 hours outside of class working on security-related projects. If you want to go forward, do it, but know it is much more difficult than the TikTok/YouTube influencers make it sound. It takes years to build up enough knowledge to be \"entry-level\" in the field. \n\nYou need to build up an understanding of how computers, networks, and software work first. Ideally, you would start a home lab (a mini server in your home) and work on programming projects. Then, choose a specialization within security that you want to do as your job. Focus on that specialization and do projects/conference talks/blog posts about it. If you want to do offensive stuff, then something like HackTheBox or TryHackMe is a good place to get experience. Also go to conferences and network with people. The projects that you have done will give you the credibility that you need to get a job. \n\nCertifications may be a good fit for you, but if you don't have a degree, that could significantly limit your options. The fact is that a lot of companies require a degree or use a degree as a way to filter out a bunch of candidates. Few hiring managers that I know care about it, but HR typically does. When you get 1000+ applicants for one role, it is a way to filter out a bunch of people quickly. \n\nI hope this is helpful!

You will also need to deal with endpoints with older versions of the EDR agent and with issues with the OS that might have contributed to it not getting its EDR agent updated (likely Windows patches were missed as well for the same reasons).  In those cases, you have to manually remove the EDR agent, either using special utilities obtained from your AV vendor or manually which requires having physical access to the endpoint.  The Agent Self-Protection feature, that most AV vendors include in their agents, adds a level of difficulty to that task.\n\nWithout the required enterprise knowledge and experience to support physical computers and virtual machines that run Windows operation systems, you likely won't get any further than an interview (in-person or remote), should you be one of the applicants lucky enough to land an interview."

This focuses on company culture, behavioural change and awareness. On a lot of my client projects I work closely with our human factors team in trying to improve the cyber security culture both for trained cyber security professionals but more so for non-cyber security professionals.\n\nThis is to help ensure that changes recommended are more likely to be adopted by the workforce (from graduate up to C-Suite). The majority of the HF consultants I work with have a background in psychology. \n\nThey develop and run surveys, workshops, training sessions and leadership coaching among other things. \n\nA big focus on this subreddit is that cybersecurity is only technical and that you must be technical to get a job in it. For some roles, yes you need to build up your technical skillset but cybersecurity is broad and encompasses many different skillsets. \n\nIf you work in a client-facing role, the majority of your stakeholders will not be technical individuals and the ability to explain technical information to a non-technical individual is advantageous."

        "content": "",
        "comments": [
            "No. I\u2019ve interviewed 4 or 5 people who graduated from long boot camps. Some of these were online, some were bundled with CompTIA certifications, or associated with a big name university. Every one of those people knew nothing. It was pretty evident that the boot camp taught them just enough to pass a certification then they forgot everything. Your money would be better spent studying for those certifications on your own while working in IT to get some experience.",
            "The root problems for bootcamps are that they are relatively new, profit-oriented, and unregulated. In a nutshell:\n\n* Unlike *programming* bootcamps, which have a comparatively established track-record of elevating the layperson to be a somewhat competent developer, *cybersecurity* bootcamps are relatively new to the scene, capitalizing on reported short-staffing problems industry-wide. There are (quite literally) dozens if not hundreds of such bootcamps being erected, all claiming to offer the same transformative experiences as their *programming* bootcamp counterparts without any real transparency to back such claims.\n* There is still little uniformity in what should reasonably constitute a \"core\" cybersecurity curriculum. Some bootcamps offered by universities act as \"certificate\" programs which feed into their undergraduate/graduate programs; some bootcamps tout as a kind of holistic \"Zero-to-Hero\" curriculum, producing all of their content in-house (or - more likely - contracting out the curriculum development to other content producers); some bootcamps structure their entire teaching experience around tutoring for *other vendor's* certification exams. The point here is that - absent an understood, unilateral, and uniform curriculum - bootcamp experiences can vary wildly. This makes it difficult for employers to judge what you actually know.\n* Becoming a subject-matter expert in cybersecurity is a massive undertaking. Talking-the-talk and speaking to concepts is one thing, but implementing and enforcing an actual solution is quite another. By-and-large, cybersecurity is handled by employers as an extension of an existing set of professional experiences; some of the most competitive candidates are those who have previous years of experience as software engineers, system administrators, etc. Artificially fostering a similar technical foundation in an X-week or Y-month bootcamp is a massive undertaking. Again - because these bootcamps are new - we don't yet have the data to prove that such an approach is a tenable alternative to more traditional forms of entry to the profession.\n* The worst - and most prolific - bootcamps of the bunch are the ones that build themselves around tutoring towards passing *other vendor's exams*. Most often, such programs aim at the lowest rungs of certifications that are technology-agnostic, including CompTIA, ISC2, and others. These include, among others: A+, Network+, Security+, Cybersecurity Certified, ITIL, etc. Many of these certifications test foundational knowledge and have a considerable number of free-alternative resources which can be tapped into to study for. Enrolling in these bootcamps often means sitting for the same exam, learning the same content, at a significant markup. But because students don't know any better, they pay the price.\n* Almost every bootcamp I've encountered is profit-oriented. This isn't inherently problematic, but in true start-up fashion, there is considerable inflation of the perceived value of the product in order to attract students (and by extension, generate revenue). In one particularly egregious case, I saw an offer to train someone to pass the CompTIA Security+ at a markup of over 10x the cost of the exam itself. In watching the bootcamp ecosystem evolve, it's not uncommon to see them pull the same content from other MOOCs (e.g. Udemy, Udacity, EdX, etc.), which - while cost effective - means that they aren't producing original content that you couldn't otherwise get at a fraction of the price ($5.99 MOOC course vs. $X thousands for enrollment). These and other ethically-dubious practices have only further diluted/damaged the bootcamp brand.\n* The real incentive to enroll in these programs is the prospect of changing careers - that on the other side is a job waiting for you. But - while your friends may anecdotally have been successful - the reality is that most folks looking to get their first break in cybersecurity really struggle. While there are a number of reports that highlight the short-staffing problem in cybersecurity, said reports often gloss over the fact that these absences are not entry-level. Absent some kind of employer-linkage program (which should NOT include becoming employed by the very bootcamp you're considering), there is little incentive for the bootcamp to assure its graduates find meaningful employment after tuition is paid.\n\nAll told however, people *do* still enroll in these kinds of programs. *Some* report satisfaction in being able to make a successful career transition. However, many in this subreddit would indicate otherwise. Your tolerance for risk should guide your decision for engaging such a resource.",
            "No. They are not worth it. Compared to the money you could spend on certifications and a degree, it's a scam. I had a bad experience with one.

            "I think that most bootcamps are not worth it.\n\nThey are usually very expensive and you can learn any of it yourself for free.\n\nThe vast majority of employers won't care that you have a bootcamp listed on your resume either.\n\nThey usually care much more about IT work experience and certifications.  The latter is much cheaper, and the former is free and actually makes you money!  Getting an IT job while doing some learning/certs on the side is probably preferred.\n\nBut if you do insist on spending lots of $ for a course, do it for one that is much more recognised than a bootcamp, such as a masters degree.\n\nThere are masters degrees in Computer Science & Cybersecurity that are intended for those without a tech bachelors.  These are often online and flexible.\n\nUltimately, I think most bootcamps are a big waste of money.  Many are also unrealistic and almost fraudulent about the alleged career prospects after doing it.\n\nOne of the only benefits of a bootcamp is that they tend to hold your hand more, are very guided & structured, and hold you to account if that's something you need.\n\nAnd I say this as someone who's done 3 bootcamps lol.",
            "I took an intro to cybersecurity course through a university that I thought was great for the $185 and 2 days a week for 4 weeks. It gave me an idea of what their extended boot camp might include. However, the best things I got out of that course was learning about all the free classes available out there and the cheaper lifetime subscription options for training that are i small percentage of the cost of a 6-10 month boot camp.

            "It comes down to the person and if they can hack getting an information overload. Every bootcamp just gets you to build projects.   I would say bootcamps are questionable,  but there\u2019s literally 6 brilliant and amazing people that I work with that all come from bootcamps on my team. Free is better!  There\u2019s lots of great resources online. Also, don\u2019t get discouraged by everyone talking about degrees.  College is ALSO VERY expensive and slow.  When you\u2019re finished with your degree, technology has moved a light year ahead. The \u201cbirds eye view\u201d in here (through everyone\u2019s complaints on how they think the road leads) is that a job in tech is a life long commitment to learning.  The journey is not linear. Jobs and hiring processes change drastically every 2-3 years, so  getting opinions from engineers is like aiming a bow and arrow in the dark.  Everyone\u2019s journey is so different from the next.  I especially wouldn\u2019t listen to anyone who has currently been with their company and role for 5 - 8 years or more.    Hiring has flipped on it backside since then.

        "content": " \n\nHi All,\n\nI currently do Incident Response and Threat Hunting for an organization and lost the passion. A few months ago, I found binary exploitation and liked it. However, I'm stuck on a roadmap. I thought of moving laterally to the RED team side, thinking it would be a good foundation. However, with pentesting there would be a lot to learn since your skills need to be broad. I wouldnt have the chance also to create exploits.\n\nI want to develop exploits and find new vulnerabilities. I have been doing RE and Malware analysis for some time now as a side hobby and some Binary Exploitation courses. As a security professional my interests and goals right now are to break tech (new and old) and find unique and creative ways of entering. \n\nWondering what a good path/road map to take to get into vulnerability research?\n\nThe way I see it there's two options:\n\n1. Get into pentesting (AD and Web) to learn the building blocks and do VR on the side. Find the area you want to specialize in and focus on the vulns there. Gain experience and do red teaming.\n2. Find a codebase and platform within a Bug Bounty platform, research the hell out of it, and start poking around. Maybe move into AppSec.\n\nVery new to this side of the house, so please feel free to correct me or add your opinions thanks!",

            "I\u2019ve learned to not lump pentesting and red teaming together because you\u2019ll piss off actual red teamers. \n\nIf I remember correctly, most actual vuln research/exploit dev focused positions prefer you to have actual CVEs. Maybe set up a fuzzer and mess around with some open source applications? \n\nYour roadmaps are both fine ideas. Why not just throw your resume at some research positions? Doesn\u2019t hurt you try and interview.",
            "I'm in a similar boat. My bread and butter is cloud security engineering, which includes \"cloud\" and api pentesting. But I started off my career with hardware RE.\n\nI am interested in red teaming AND exploit dev but as you mentioned, I don't think it makes sense to go for both.  \n\nWhat I've heard from exploit developers, that red teamers tend to not do well shifting into exploit dev. No idea why, but their advice was simple. Go for exploit development if that is what you want to do.  \n\nI'm currently wrapping up some more red team/pentesting certificates that I had planned. But then I will make the decision to definitively continue red team or focus solely on exploit development."

The program is taught by some pretty influential people in the Cybersecurity world. I've had a professor that is legal counsel or FISA, career Signal (IT) Officer in the Army, a CTO for Dell Technologies, and some career cybersecurity authors and senior personnel (CISO/CIO) in some organizations.\n\nMost of us don't have a hardcore computer science/IT background, though some do.

        "content": "Background: I am a 15 year active duty service member currently in aircraft maintenance. My first job in maintenance was avionic sensors/electronic warfare systems, where I troubleshot system failures using test equipment/software and replaced hardware/components. Then I was forced to retrain due to my career field being overmanned, so now I'm currently in Low Observable structural maintenance (F-35s/F-22s), but nowadays I'm essentially a manager. \n\nI have always been interested in IT back in high school and I even obtained my A+ and Net+ certs in 2005 (back when they were GFL), prior to enlisting. Recently, I have had conversations with old buddies from high school that are still in the IT industry and I mentioned that I wished I had stayed in that career track. I curiously asked if they would think I had a chance to get back into IT after I retire from the Air Force and they seem to think there is a strong possibility, as long as I obtain certifications and stay knowledgeable. \n\nI am currently pursuing an MBA but the conversations I've had with my buddies and my wife have had me question if this is really what I want to pursue. I have always told my wife and fellow Airmen to pursue a degree in something they would love to do as a career and for some reason I have not followed my own advice.\n\nMy main question is this: Should I pursue a different degree more relevant in IT, or should I focus on obtaining certifications/self-teaching? I'm currently interested in the [MS in Computer Info Systems](https://catalog.fit.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=9&poid=3263) from Florida Tech and think this would give me a good foundation prior to retiring from the Air Force and hopefully provide me the knowledge/skills to prepare me for certifications. There is also another avenue, which is the [Microsoft Software and Systems Academy](https://military.microsoft.com/programs/microsoft-software-systems-academy/) that I can attend once I'm 6 months out from retiring. My end goal is to eventually be in cyber security. I appreciate any advice/feedback that you may all provide me, and I apologize for this long post.",

            "Good morning! Former F-16 Weapons guy here, now a CISSP. As a former Avionics guys, you should have an easier time than I did at the transition.\n\nDon't waste your time with the Microsoft academy. I'm not going to say that it's worthless because someone might value it, but I personally have not run across anyone in my career that thinks anything of it. Instead, you should immediately apply for Syracuse University's Onward to Opportunity program https://ivmf.syracuse.edu/programs/career-training/#:~:text=Onward%20to%20Opportunity%20(O2O)%20is,members%2C%20veterans%20and%20military%20spouses.\n\nIf you're married, your spouse can sign up for that too. But I highly recommend getting Sec+ before you get out. You'll be dead in the water without it. If you want to do Cyber Security for the government, you'll need EC Council's Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) or CompTIA's Cyber Security Analyst+ (CySA+). The two are the same to the government, but CySA+ is cheaper. \n\nI've also done interviews on the hiring side for Leidos. My advice: stick with your MBA, and go for certs. Your certs and experience speak far louder than some Cyber Security degree from a college that hasn't updated their materials in 2 years. An MBA is still valuable in this career field, and will also help if you want to transition out of it because it's valued in a lot of other industries as well. An MBA or any degree for that matter will probably not help you get a job. It'll help in getting you an interview and it'll be a fantastic negotiating point when negotiating your salary, but I've never once looked at a candidate with a degree and went \"skip the interview, they're hired\"\n\n You probably won't have to start out at a help desk since you already have a clearance. Your salary level will be highly dependent on where you're going. I know the St. Louis area pretty well, so I'll only speak on it.\n\nSo you've magically appeared in St Louis. You have your Sec+, you have at least a TS security clearance, and you want to make $100k+/year. Your first step is probably Leidos at DISA. You won't be able to start in Cyber Security straight off the bat, but you'll still probably start in the 60-70k range as a network controller. Cool. So you do that for a year, you've earned your CEH/CySA+ and you're ready to move on. Now you apply for a job with CACI at the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) for a cyber security gig, and they start you at the $105k-110k range. It happens fast in St. Louis for people willing to put in the work for certs.",
            "I worked with a guy who essentially did what you\u2019re talking about. Come from the flight line to the office as our ISSM (Information Systems Security Manager). Having a degree in IT/Cyber and certs helps bridge the gap where you lack experience. The only issue is that you may have to start out on Help Desk or any job to break into the industry and work your way into a managerial level IT role. Nothing that you\u2019re not accustomed to or can\u2019t overcome given your background. My advice, get the IT/Cyber degree, get Security + (at a minimum), and start looking for jobs. If you plan on working for the DoD still (either contractor or civilian), you have a big advantage based on your experience and time in uniform. Best of luck!",
            "I'm a hiring manager for a federal contractor. I have an MS, an MBA, and all the big-name security certification. Additionally, I provide a lot of direct mentorship (online and in-person) to many folks in similar positions as yours. Here are the specific things I would recommend to someone in your position:\n\n1. Decide if you want to be a technical IT person or a manager as they have very different career paths and knowledge requirements.\n\nIf management:\n\n1. Maintain your clearance until you find a job that you're happy with for the long-term. Know that if you can only work for 2 years in a non-cleared role before you lose your clearance for good.\n2. Focus on finishing your MBA.\n3. Security+ and CISSP before you transition out. For all intents and purposes, these are the only two general IT certs that matter for contractors. Every other cert is job-dependent and not worth pursuing unless you know exactly what type of role you're shooting for.\n4. Start looking for IT jobs where your existing domain knowledge is useful and relevant and fill in any knowledge, education, and experience gaps that you can before you transition out. For example, in your case, Google \"F22 cyber engineer\" and look at the requirements for the first ten or so jobs that come up. Work on building a basic competency in any tools or frameworks that show up for more than 30% of searches.\n5. Accept that you may not get a high-paying IT management job right away, but you'll generally be on the fast track to doing so. For most of the country, the salary floor for someone with a Security+ and a Secret clearance is about $60k. Add in a CISSP, and that goes to around $75k. You can usually do a lot better if network well and line up a couple of opportunities before you get out.\n\nIf technical:\n\n1. Maintain your clearance.\n2. Get your Security+ and CISSP.\n3. Start learning about the different technical fields and (networking, cloud, sysadmin, etc.) and figure out which one interests you most. Once you figure that out, your time is better spent mastering that technology than earning a master's degree.\n4. My advice for steps 4 and 5 is the same for technical as it is for management.\n\nGenerally speaking, I try to steer retirees toward the management track first. A lot of guys start out thinking they want to get their hands dirty but quickly become disillusioned with the politics of the tech industry. Starting over at the bottom is harder than most people want to acknowledge. People are generally much more status-driven than we're consciously aware of; it can feel really weird and offputting to go to work for supporting a shop from the bottom when your knowledge and experience suggests you could be running the whole thing.\n\nAlso, it's harder to maintain a technical focus as a contractor than you might think. If you're any good at your job, you're going to be roped into doing a bunch of management-type work anyway, just without the pay and status to go along with it. I could go on about this, but it's better left for an offline conversation.\n\nFeel free to ask away with follow-up questions. I've been doing this for a long time as both a senior technical guy and a manager, so I should be able to answer any specific questions you might have."

For IAM, try looking into certifications like Okta, Azure AD, or other IAM-specific tools and highlight your experience with firewalls and technical infrastructure, which translates well to identity management. For GRC, focus on building up knowledge of frameworks like ISO 27001, NIST, or GDPR, depending on the region and industry.",

Just saying \u201cyou will be a manager one day kid\u201d seduced a lot of people. \n\n- you are almost always worth more to someone else, but make sure your skill set (technical and non) is ready. \n\n- If your seriously thinking about moving roles start saving, money is the biggest reason people don\u2019t move (odd as that sounds), if you move is a chance it doesn\u2019t work out and your easily terminated. Are people out there in fair sr positions who can\u2019t go the 4+ weeks it can take some companies to issue you a first paycheck. Not being stressed over that will be the best thing for your transition.\n\n- Think about if a higher salary will make you happy. A lot of people get offers to try and have the current employer match it. I really don\u2019t like this as they just take it out of your next raise, but if you love everything but the money is effective",

        "content": "I quit my good paying job at a very big, well known company due to extreme burnout. Poor training that didn't cover 1% of anything you need to know, including internal tools that we constantly are just learning even exist to aid in troubleshooting, actual job had almost nothing to do with what i interviewed for, agile development environment that don't do any kind of testing before pushing into production, which causes us to constantly chase bugs to prove to other engineers that they broke something and require us to gather all the evidence and expect us to just know how they designed all our systems and APIs that we dont even have access to or knew even existed, which causes us to play 20 questions with the backend engineers, who don't believe they can do any wrong and brush you off like you're the idiot, while on the phone with angry customers wanting resolutions 5 minutes before even submitting a ticket. They are very escalation happy if their issue isn't resolved within 2 minutes, which causes 10x more work and stress, because you are barely in the information gathering stage, looking through logs, trying to determine what failed, having to play 20 questions with customers.\n\nTypical day is accept a ticket, customer calls front line ask to speak to me, answer their call, \"hello? I need to raise severity. Did you find the issue?\", customer isn't happy they don't have an answer within 2 minutes of me accepting the ticket, they call the front line ask to escalate the case, front line reques the case, I have to go back to my ticket system to find it to assign it back to me, front line asks why It belongs to me again, explain to them I was told to by my manager. I'm trying to read through device logs and app logs to find a bug between our hardware and software, customer escalates to the VP of my company, now I get questioned by 5 other engineers and management about what my next steps are, how I'm going to resolve it, answering emails that are constantly being sent out about it, got 4 different chats going and that's just this one case, not to mention the 5 other tickets I got all trying to do the same thing, which severely takes away from your time you could actually be troubleshooting, and you're still in queue accepting tickets, very rarely get to take a lunch, consistently stay late to be able to breathe and focus on other tickets to not get too far behind.\n\nAs much as I don't enjoy dealing with customers at this level, I really am an advocate for the customer and disagree with alot of company practices, and do my best to resolve issues as quickly as humanly possible, and voice my concerns to the company of how to improve, but they end up expecting more out of us, demand higher customer satisfaction, and not doing anything to improve the product or processes that got us here. \n\nI am by no means lazy, or incapable, and always was able to handle a lot more stress than most. Iraq was less stressful to me.. Maybe I am whining just a little bit. I am passionate about tech. It's all I do in my free time.\n\n I busted my butt to get here. I did the army thing and for 10 years I was blue collar working 72+ hour weeks, on top of going to college for software development, ended up getting my first tier 1 networking job, help desk was not my favorite, but I learned a ton and that company didn't bend over backwards at the whim of every customer, which was nice, continued to get my Master's in cybersecurity while working there, then landed into this mess. I had a very good manager, who I do respect, and obviously would've fired me if he thought i couldn't do the job, but the issues are much bigger than anyone really has any control over. Pressure from shareholders causing executives to make dumb decisions, which is always at the worker's expense.\n\nThis has got me to the point of thinking did I make a mistake going into tech if this is how it is? Maybe I just got unlucky and landed the wrong job, maybe there's a better career path in tech more suited for me, maybe smaller companies are better? Is every company going to be this way and how the future is going to look? Even got me contemplating if this is an America issue and if I should try leaving for the European lifestyle.\n\nI knew I was burnt out when I started experiencing brain fog, and getting irritated at not being able to make simple decisions like what I wanted for dinner. Every weekend was spent stressing about Monday, or logging in to learn more or troubleshoot to update a ticket for Monday, because there just isn't enough time.\n\nI'm interested in your thoughts, accusations, sharing experiences, or anything else.

That's literally a job for power bi developers. I have been trying to move on from this company since they started assigning me to such work. I also tried changing teams to get other cyber work.

I obtained the CompTIA CySA+ 2 years ago and last year the CISSP during my free time and did not receive any kind of \u201cmarket adjustment rate\u201d raise or promotion of any kind in my time spent here. Instead, I got the typical of my company, yearly generic 3% raise, which, with inflation being what it is, is a pay cut.\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve learned all I can in this position and there is absolutely no more growth or experience to be gained, having felt this way for the last 2.5 years. For the better part of my tenure here I\u2019ve been searching for the next stage in my career. Something more hands on than just combing through redundant logs and issuing the same tickets day in and day out that never get answered and closed automatically after 24 hours of inactivity.\n\nI\u2019m at my wits end here as I\u2019ve sent several hundreds of resumes and I either don\u2019t get a response or when I do finally get on interviews, I get praised for my knowledge and expertise yet find out they move forward with other candidates because I\u2019m lacking experience. The chicken and egg scenario, how am I supposed to get more experience if my job does not allow nor incentivize it? I really thought getting CISSP which as the joke goes is required for a lot of entry-level positions in cybersecurity would be my golden ticket for finally escaping this hole I\u2019ve found myself in. It hasn\u2019t really made much of a difference as I\u2019m still not hearing back or getting rejected at about the same rate.\n\nI don\u2019t know what else to do at this point. I see the same positions I\u2019ve already applied for and been rejected from being posted every week. So, my assumptions are that the field isn\u2019t that short on skills if they keep posting the position in the hopes of getting the absolutely perfect candidate who fills all their criteria or the position just doesn\u2019t pay well for the people who actually do fit those criteria and are hoping people will settle rather than train up someone. All I know is that I get told they are going with another candidate (I know, it\u2019s a generic rejection letter; I just don\u2019t get any other kinds of feedback). \n\nI\u2019ve been contemplating leaving the field entirely because I can\u2019t advance in it, and I don\u2019t want to keep feeling miserable in this same position 5 more years down the road, but I have no experience or really any interest in other fields because I love this stuff. I keep hearing how hot and well-paying the field is but my experience these past 5 years has been anything but, it just really depresses me seeing people just starting out in the technical fields or in unrelated skills such as working in HR positions making over $100k a year, and I\u2019m nowhere near that. For those who have been in a similar position, how did you get out of this predicament?\n\nUPDATE: People have suggested some of the cause for my predicament with no responses to job apps is because of my resume being filtered out since it was not made by someone with a cybersecurity background and not properly conveying my experience.

The CISSP is a little out of place and thats why companies are confused that this guy has a CISSP and still working at L1, so they get spooked and dont proceed\n\nShitty situation i know, but it is what it is\n\nWhat I have seen that once you get a hang of L1 responsibilities, being a little bit more involved delivering some SOC improvements related projects really shows that you are ready for the next level, where tbh the real meat of the SOC work is. L2 work is less investigative and more towards the improvements, deployments and administration side and tbh I personally enjoy working on that level more than L1 tbh. \n\nSo yea just be a little more proactive and have some projects to show the mgmt that you are ready for the next level or the next role.

I'm seeing more mature frameworks and best practices knocking out a lot of the low-hanging fruit I'd routinely run into earlier in my career.

We are impressed by what you have accomplished. We are convinced that you can pick up the skills on the fly and do a great job, but we aren't proceeding with your application because you don't have work experience with these technologies\". \n\nHow on earth am I going to get experience if neither my employer not a potential future employer is willing to give me a chance?! I did all I can. I did the courses. I did the labs. And I did my personal projects. What more can I give? The only reason why I didn't take certifications is because all of them cost at least half of my entire month salary. I can't afford that shit when I have to put food on the table for a big family. \n\nWhat can I do? I did all I can. I'm in pain and can't think of what to do next.

            "I\u2019ll let others suggest specialties, but as someone who has interviewed newly post-military candidates, here\u2019s my best advice:\n\nThe private sector values very different things than the military. A common thing I have seen in post-military candidates is a feeling like they can\u2019t make decisions themselves; namely, when asked how they would deal with a difficult situation, many times the candidate mentions letting management make the decisions or deal with it. Given this has been a common answer amongst all the military candidates I\u2019ve interviewed, I assume this comes from needing to follow a chain of command.\n\nHowever, in the private sector, initiative is highly valued. Part of what they\u2019re hiring you for is to make decisions about your day to day work, and your manager probably won\u2019t want to make every decision. So if you feel like the attitude I mentioned is how you\u2019d approach issues, I\u2019d recommend adjusting your perspective before interviewing and taking the time to think through how you\u2019d solve issues assuming you didn\u2019t have a commanding officer to consult or pass the decision to. Showing initiative and an ability to problem solve yourself will win you a lot of points in your interviews.\n\nI mostly mention this because I believe all the candidates I interviewed were capable of problem solving and handling issues themselves, but they just didn\u2019t realize they were *allowed* to because of their recent time in the military.",
            "Cloud, cloud, cloud.

A lot of other infosec companies like CloudFlare are also FedRAMP certified, they'll all need cleared personnel as well:\n\n[Pentagon splits $9 billion cloud contract among 4 companies](https://apnews.com/article/technology-politics-amazoncom-inc-cloud-computing-us-department-of-defense-bfaeb3549b4d42328f35e579d7cb40b0)\n\nWith your experience, clearance and a couple of cloud certs you could probably apply for jobs starting at $150K and go from there.\n\nJust pick a public cloud platform to cert up, give yourself a crash course in terraform and you're off to the races .",
            "Here's a response I posted to someone else that is pretty applicable to you as well:\n\nYou need to ask yourself three questions.\n\nDo you want to stay DoD or go private? Pluses and minuses to both. If you stay DoD, you'll pretty easily land a ISSO/ISSM position with your background (either contractor or GS), which will pay $120-$180k depending on location, you'll work 40 hours a week, and never worry about job security. From there, you can compete for GS-15/SES positions. Compensation levels off pretty fast, though; most people move up in government for the mission and the connections, not the $.\n\nIf going private, do you want to do work in security, or develop/sell security products? If you're open to some level of sales, there are tons of cybersecurity companies that are always looking to hire Sales Engineers and Product Managers. These jobs pay very well as they are directly tied to revenue, but may not feel as mission-driven and do have some level of crazy hours.\n\nIf staying in private-sector security, do you want to do hands-on technical (security engineer->Architect), technical management (TL->EM->VP ENG or CTO), or governance/risk/compliance (Auditor->GRC Manager->CISO)? Hands-on technical pays the best at senior levels. but lots of competition and intense continuing education/learning. Tech management has less competition but many fewer positions available, plus harder to get as an external candidate. GRC is a little different; pays less, less tech/more paperwork, but generally 9-5 and more likely to lead to CISO roles.\n\nNotes:\n\nYour best source for a ballpark comp figure is probably going to the Stanton House cybersecurity salary report, which was actually just updated for 2023 (https://www.stantonhouse.com/us/cybersecurity-salary-and-recruiting-trends-guide-2023-download). TLDR: $200k is probably a good estimate, but market is tight right now. \nYour certs/education is fine, nobody cares too much about which certs or what type of degree in private industry, as long as you have something.\nNetworking is key - most of the senior roles you probably want get filled through word-of-mouth or recruiters before they hit job boards. Skillbridge if you can, work LinkedIn, etc. VetSec is a good resource as well to ask some of these questions."

The point here is that my strong foundation in IT knowledge helped me become a great IT security professional.\n\nI really do enjoy network, operations, compliance, and auditing security.  Those are pretty broad areas, but those are my favorite.  I am diving more into IAM and BIA recently and those are of interest to me as well but I classify those as operations.\n\nI don't see security going away, but I do see a move into security automation.  Security professionals cannot react fast enough when there is an incident, and the viruses, malware, and other attack programs are only going to get faster.  Security automation is the next big thing coming.  Application and cloud security will also be huge in the future.  I don't see any security areas going away.\n\nAll security jobs have high earning potential.

        "title": "The Hard Truth About Breaking Into Cybersecurity",
        "content": "Hi everyone,\nBreaking into cybersecurity has always been tough, but now it\u2019s harder than ever. I\u2019ve been in the field for 7 years, and during that time, I\u2019ve earned certifications and degrees while working in various roles and industries. Based on my experience and conversations with hiring managers, directors, and VPs, I want to share some hard truths and advice about getting into the field. Keep in mind, this is just my perspective\u2014it won\u2019t apply to everyone, but this is what I\u2019ve seen.\n\nCertifications Alone Aren\u2019t Enough\n\nYears ago, having certifications like Security+ or CySA+ was a big deal, but today, they don\u2019t hold the same weight. Certifications are still important, but the market is oversaturated\u2014everyone has them. Hiring managers are looking for more now, like degrees, technical experience, and specialized skills.\n\nIf you\u2019re relying solely on certifications, it\u2019s not impossible to break into the field, but it\u2019s definitely harder than it used to be.\n\nDegrees Are a Game-Changer\n\nI\u2019ve spoken with many hiring managers and VPs, and they\u2019ve all said the same thing: degrees still matter. Employers see them as a sign of a solid foundation in cybersecurity, especially from well-known schools.\n\nFor example, I earned my master\u2019s in Information Security and Privacy from a very reputable school, and it opened doors for me that certifications alone couldn\u2019t. Hiring managers have told me to my face during the first week on the job that they only hired me because of the name of my school and how reputable it is.  Of course, there are more accessible options like WGU, but even WGU programs are getting saturated. If you\u2019re serious about breaking into the field, a degree paired with certifications is the way to go! \n\nThe Application Security Route\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to figure out the best way into cybersecurity, I highly recommend application security. It\u2019s one of the most underserved areas in the field, and there aren\u2019t enough people specializing in it. Companies are always looking for application security professionals, and it\u2019s a great way to stand out in a crowded market.\n\nThe Truth About TikTok Advice\n\nLet me be blunt: most TikTok \u201ccybersecurity experts\u201d are lying or don\u2019t have the experience they claim. They make breaking into cybersecurity sound easy, and that\u2019s just not true. Many of them are doing it purely for views and clickbait.\n\nThat said, there are a few accounts I\u2019ve found that give genuinely good advice:\n\t\u2022\tCyber_Warrior\n\t\u2022\tAndrenajee\n\t\u2022\tSwenius\n\nThese are the only accounts I trust on TikTok. Everyone else? Ignore them. They\u2019re not in the field, they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about, or they are in the field and just doing it to sell a course or make side money. They\u2019re doing more harm than good by misleading people.\n\nAlso, never pay for a mentor or someone promising to help you \u201cbreak into big tech.\u201d These people are scamming you. You don\u2019t need to pay anyone to succeed in this field. Focus on building real skills and networking with legitimate professionals.\n\nThe GRC Myth\n\nA lot of people think Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) is an easy way into cybersecurity, but it\u2019s not as simple as it seems. Many GRC roles now require technical experience because you need to be able to explain technical issues to non-technical stakeholders. While it\u2019s not impossible to get into GRC without a technical background, it\u2019s definitely harder. A better approach is to start with a technical role, like SOC analyst or application security, and transition into GRC later if that\u2019s your goal.\n\nAdvice and referrals \n\nLastly, I\u2019m happy to refer people and give more advice \u2014but I need to be clear: I will only refer Americans. Not to get political but trump is listening to Elon musk and Ramaswamy and bringing in hoards of Indians on H1B visa. The are paying them for a fraction of the cost as they would pay true hard working Americans. Getting tech jobs in general will be extremely hard for Americans. This is the reason why I will only be helping American citizens ONLY. \n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nEveryone\u2019s journey is different, but this is what I\u2019ve seen work for myself and others. It takes persistence and dedication, but if you put in the work, you\u2019ll get there.\n\nGood luck to everyone working toward their cybersecurity goals!",

Even in entry level roles, we're looking for folks who take the time to explore, build and experience systems that will bring some kind of specialized talent to our teams. \n\nAlso, if you don't know how to write documentation, breaking down the complexities of cyber security and how it relates to the average user then you should take time building that.

        "title": "Sick of some Cybersecurity influencers lying about how easy it is to break In",
        "content": "I notice that there are more and more influencers promoting cybersecurity lately.  Aspiring cybersecurity folks need to be aware that some cybersecurity social media influencers keep advertising how easy it is to get into the field, which is extremely misleading.\n\nCybersecurity is not an entry-level position; it's actually a senior and even management-level role. Most cybersecurity positions require strong knowledge of networking and systems. Aspiring cybersecurity professionals need to start from helpdesk roles and work their way up over many years, progressing through Network/System/Cloud admin positions before they can become cybersecurity professionals.\n\nI've noticed that the situation is getting worse lately. Recently, a surge of those YouTubers and LinkedIn cybersecurity influencers are promoting GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) as an easy entry-level path for career changers. In fact, many are just promoting their own expensive online courses, which hold little value for employers. The truth is, it's extremely difficult for career changers to break into GRC roles. For students, it is more viable to pursue the GRC route by starting with an IT audit internship at an accounting firm, obtaining CISA/CISSP certifications, and eventually working in GRC. However, it's not so easy for mid-career changers.\n\nSome claim that transferable skills can facilitate a career change into these roles, but this is TOTAL NONSENSE. Let me explain - there are over hundreds of applicants for every Cybersecurity or GRC position in my region. If you were an employer, would you choose a candidate with actual cybersecurity experience or someone with just \"transferable skills\" from unrelated job experience? In this economy, where even experienced professionals are struggling, basic home labs or those useless \"job simulations\" (which often don't actually validate your skills) from some online platforms carry little weight with employers without prior actual related experiences.\n\nI can understand and agree if they are promoting blue team roles such as SOC. There are indeed entry-level SOC positions out there. But the truth is that the majority of cybersecurity positions are in fact senior-level Network Security or IT risk and governance manager roles.\n\nOf course, from time to time, there are some outliers who have successfully changed careers into GRC, but they often need quite a bit of luck and extensive networking and referrals to do so.\n\nNetworking and referrals are key, as most jobs are filled through personal connections. But promoting cybersecurity as an easy field to transition into is misleading. If the only feasible path is through networking, that applies to any career - I am a mechanical engineer and I could become a Marketing Director if I know the right people. You can be successful in any field if you have the right connections.\n\nSo, I urge aspiring cybersecurity enthusiasts to be very careful about those Youtubers and influencers who keep \"selling\" the idea that it's easy to get into cybersecurity. It's not, and their courses won't help much with employers. Aspiring cybersecurity professionals need to understand the realities of the field and plan their career journeys accordingly.\n\n\u00a0",

Aspiring cybersecurity professionals need to start from helpdesk roles and work their way up over many years, progressing through Network/System/Cloud admin positions before they can become cybersecurity professionals.\n\nI don't belive this is true anymore.

            "I\u2019ve always had the mindset that to get started in cyber you needed to have at least two of four things (besides the need for passion and persistence):\n\n- IT Work Experience \n- An IT-related Degree\n- Certifications \n- Networking (Know someone) \n\nWith one, you\u2019re gonna be lost in the sea of other applicants.\n\nWith two, you stand a better chance, but it isn\u2019t foolproof.\n\nThree or all four and you have a good chance of landing a role. \n\nFor my start in cyber in the late \u201810\u2019s, I had all four. For someone else I know, they had two, a cert and a reference (it helps they\u2019re one of the smartest people I know and put in a ton of effort to prove themselves). Most I know in the field, though, had three or four. It\u2019s luck of the draw but statistically speaking, the resume density matters. \n\nI think a junior analyst role can be entry level but it\u2019s a very advanced entry level at best, and it requires the SOC team to be mature enough to absorb those entry level folks and effectively train them. At worse, it\u2019s really, as many said, an intermediate or journeyman level role.",

An MSP or government has actual entry level positions, but a small manufacturing company might not since their IT team itself may be only a small handful of people. I will say there are less entry level jobs in the private sector than there was 5 years ago, but government and military is an option for those who can go that route.\n\n>I've noticed that the situation is getting worse lately.

I have been wanting to start a cyber security career for a while now so I have practiced hackthebox trying to get a taste of what a pentest job would be like because I believe that is ultimately what I would like to do as a job. I see job posts for pentesters and I see that the experience required is usually a little hefty and usually requires certs I don't have yet (currently have Sec+ and CASP+).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday I had an interview for a position as a Cybersecurity Analyst and the interviewer at the end already told me I had the job. The job pays 7k a year more (at least that is what I asked for and he agreed to), and I am scared. Here are my thoughts:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Is a Cyber Analyst a good foot-in-the-door job for an ultimate goal of being a pentester? Is there something better as a gateway position?\n2. If anyone has worked with eMASS, STIGS, SCAP and ACAS scans do you enjoy your job? Was/is it a good learning experience for cyber?\n3. Is now a \"smart\" time to be making a career move given the state of the world?\n4. Is saying \"you will start off drinking from a fire hydrant\" a red flag in transitioning to a job like this or is that an appropriate comparison?\n\nI think this is a good job with a good company and maybe I am overthinking things but I like my job and I am just worried it could end up being something I hate since it sounds like mostly being a \"paper pusher\", but it almost seems like that is THE starting point for most cyber careers from what I have heard.",

            "Analyst is a good first step. At least, it was mine. \n\nI work with STIGs and POA&Ms - extremely boring for most people. You\u2019re literally using archaic govt software to find a STIG that corresponds to a current vulnerability and you document it blah blah blah. \n\nI made a career move during all of this. Probably not the *best* time for a move but I\u2019ve been fine, and I\u2019d say I take this whole thing a lot more seriously than most people. \n\nAnd that\u2019s not a red flag, IMO, that\u2019s just a thing that people say. It\u2019s like a work colloquialism. I just consider it office-speak for \u201ctheres a lot to do\u201d or \u201cwe don\u2019t have a lot of the processes in place yet\u201d - but guess what, you\u2019re job is likely going to be to make those processes. That\u2019s what cyber security really is. Just documenting and babysitting sysadmins. Documenting vulns that should be easy to fix but for some reason can\u2019t be in a timely manner. \n\nCyber Security isn\u2019t as sexy as people think. You\u2019ll likely be living in a SIEM, or in a vuln scanner, or in a DLP console, or all three. You\u2019ll be doing a lot of paperwork/documenting, you\u2019ll be shocked at how annoying it is that the sysadmins that you babysit won\u2019t just update that CentOS 4 server, etc. etc. etc. \n\nBut it\u2019s good experience and good money and if the company is good, then go for it. IT, especially cyber security, seems to be pretty insulated. \n\nI say go for it. It\u2019s a direct move-up in your career. If it\u2019s not for you, do a good job and check out in a year with your impossible-to-get \u201ccyber security\u201d experience that everyone wants but no one wants to give.",
            "I would say that an Analyst is a good step forward. You would be more doing Incident handling rather than incident Responding IMO.\n\nThe thing with Cyber Security is that it is massive. You think IT is massive:\n\n* Systems - Systems admin, engineers, designers, IT support, Application support\n* Network - Network admin, engineers, designers, NOC, VOIP, \n* Storage - DB admin, hardware, storage \n\nThen there is cyber security - its massive:\n\n* DFIR\n* Compliance\n* Bug Bounties\n* RedTeaming\n* Engineering\n* Assurance\n* IAM\n* Threat Hunting\n* Threat Intelligence\n* Incident Handling\n* SOC\n* Vulnerability management\n\nEach one of these has its own specialty too. DFIR - You wanna be the guy that works with volatility, or work for the Government doing Incident reponse, boots on the floor - basically map out and log out how an attack has taken place. Where did they exfil data, what did they user to obfuscate commands etc. Or you want to do Red Teaming where you're attacking networks, processes and people. But you can even further specialise. Say; in infrastructure c2 setups, or you can specialise in bypassing EDRs. etc. Choice is yours.\n\nPeople say that Cyber security is not sexy because they just think that you live in security tools, when its not like that at all. Sure, if you work at the SOC as an analyst. But there are other areas of Cyber security that you can venture out.. and there are specialties within. It goes deep.\n\nSource: Service Desk doing 50 calls a day from reseting passwords to \"my mouse wont work, get me a new one.\" Now I am a Red teamer and I love it."

        "title": "Recent cybersecurity masters graduate with regrets and questions",
        "content": "Hi all,\n\nI am going to obscure my identity, including the university I attended, because I want to speak honestly about the academic program but I still need my advisor's recommendation for jobs. If anyone is interested though, send me a DM and I can give more details.\n\nFirstly I apologize for the length, but for your convenience, I have split it up into an internet-friendly numbered list. Feel free to skip around and not read the whole thing. Secondly I apologize because I know this is a relatively well-covered topic, but I am curious what people think of my exact situation.\n\n**1. Background**\n\nI am in my early 30s, and a year or so ago, I left my career in a very technical, but not computer-focused, field to pursue cybersecurity. I was bored at all the \\[technical career\\] jobs I ever had, and I had taken a serious interest in security for the previous \\~2 years. I felt like my old career didn't have any meaning or long-term interesting challenges, but I knew that cybersecurity would be meaningful and that it would challenge me for my entire life. I'm in it for the endless challenge, encountering and solving novel problems and the love of the field, not for the promise of a 6 figure salary. I did some of the standard exploration before leaving my job--I got my head around Linux and some basic sysadmin stuff, completed online CTFs and security challenges, did basic forensics projects on spam emails I received, etc.\n\n**2. The Beginning**\n\nI knew I wanted to change careers and I wanted to make the transition fast if I could. I live close to \\[local university\\], and they had recently started offering a 1 year Cybersecurity Masters program. Though the masters is new, they have a undergraduate cybersecurity program and the department has quite a long history. I went to meet with the director of the program and at the time, everything seemed very nice and above board. She reported to me that they had a 98% placement rate after graduation and told me stories of graduates going on to be penetration testers, etc. The program was relatively cheap compared to other programs that I had researched and the university was local, so I pulled the trigger, quit my job, and started the program.\n\n**3. A lament about my university**\n\nOnce I was in it, I could tell that it wasn't exactly what I had imaged it would be. I was imagining like \"Okay, I know 1 year is not long, but this program will be a bootcamp of sorts that will kick my knowledge and abilities to the next level in a short time. It'll give me some experience, skills, and a credential.\" That was FAR from the truth. The program essentially consisted of writing a \\~200 word discussion post once or twice a week and occasionally doing a beginner level TryHackMe class. This is absolutely not an exaggeration. There was a single class, Network Security, that had ANYTHING more difficult that what I previously described and all that it required was to set up some virtually networked VMs and scan them with nmap. The program was genuine slop. I can hardly believe that it is an accredited masters program. I kept comforting myself, like \"okay, but its a real program, right? If they say this is what I need to know, then this must be what I need to know.\n\nI should have left after the first semester, but the sunk-cost fallacy is hard to get over (even when you are aware of it) and I didn't know where else to turn. I kept clinging to the what they had told me: 98% placement. \"I'm a smart guy, I was in a technical career,\" I thought, \"surely I can get a job.\" I had quit my old job and I badly wanted a career in cybersecurity. Despite the red flags, I was fully committed, so I stuck it out, hoping that the classes would get better and hoping that the credential would help me get SOME job in security so that I could start building real experience.\n\n**4. Post-graduation reality**\n\nNow I have graduated. All my friends and family are congratulating me for having a masters and seem so hopeful about my future. I, on the other hand, have realized that I am now overqualified on paper and vastly under-qualified in reality and I have no idea how I am supposed to move forward. I have been applying for jobs since graduation, but I haven't even landed an interview. If I did, I know that I don't have the knowledge or skills that they're looking for so I don't even know how I would handle an interview. Ninety percent of the security jobs I see require at least 3-5 years experience, and the ones that don't still have qualifications and experience requirements that I don't have.\n\n**5. Attempting to patch up my education and move on**\n\nI have been trying to do online courses and personal projects to gain experience, but the courses that I have tried are not very helpful and don't seem to teach actual skills. It feels like I'm stuck in a loop of hearing about what risk management is, how important security testing is, what a red team does, how you should implement a zero-trust model to secure your network, what Mitre ATT&CK is, etc. Which like, okay, but knowing those things doesn't give me skills! I need to be able to DO SOMETHING. My personal projects are fun and probably actually helpful, but its always hard for me to gauge if a recruiter will think they are worth anything. My feeling is that I need a job in the industry, even a tangential one, in order to get any meaningful experience. My last job in \\[technical field\\] had very little to do with my education, and while it was difficult to adjust to at first, the pressure and hands-on environment helped me learn quickly and excel at the job anyway.\n\n**6. Help desk or internship? Can I really expect either?**\n\nWhen I read about it online, I see that the typical advice is that I should try to get a job at a help-desk or as a sysadmin. Would anyone really hire me to a help desk if I am applying with a masters in cybersecurity? It just seems like an odd mismatch. Though I have fully switched all my personal computing to Linux (RedHat family) and set up some home IT infrastructure, I don't think I could reasonably work as a sysadmin yet either in terms of skill.\n\nThe next thing that I see people recommending is to do a security-related internship. This is the most appealing option to me, but again there are roadblocks. All of the internship postings I see require the applicant to be enrolled in an undergraduate cybersecurity program, and they are all summer internships. Is it possible any companies would be willing to take a recent masters graduate as an intern? I don't really care about pay, I'd take $15/hr for an internship. Hell, I'd even do it for free as long as I was getting real experience! That would sure beat sitting at home trying to learn from online courses and personal projects.\n\n**7. Hindsight is 20/20**\n\nIf I had this to do over, I would have just gotten a helpdesk job straight away, gotten some certs while working there, and tried to move up. I just got taken in by the idea that a masters program would be rigorous, challenging, and teach me some interesting stuff about security. \n\n**8. TLDR and Questions**\n\ntl;dr: Quit my job and got a masters in cybersecurity. Now I'm too overqualified and under-skilled for any job, can't get an internship because they are for undergraduates or enrolled students.\n\n**Main questions:**\n\nShould I just try to do my \"hindsight is 20/20\" move from here? Is help-desk the way?\n\nWould the companies that you guys work for hire a masters graduate at a help-desk or as an intern?\n\nIf I contacted companies and told them \"Hey, I know your internship program is supposed to be for the summer, but I just graduated and there's nothing that I am qualified for. I need experience. Do you have room for a fall intern?\" Do you think anyone would be responsive to that?\n\nShould I be trying to get certs on top of the masters? I would like to, but I also don't want to sink even more money down the drain trying to get into this career if those credentials are also just going to flop without experience.",

            "I understand your level of frustration. Overall I think a lot of college cyber curriculum aren\u2019t embedded with real world cyber security training. A student needs to understand the different tactics, techniques and procedures of IT security. You mentioned risk management! Did you know that\u2019s what every organization or agency employs security specialists to assist with? Design, build, secure, monitor and the list goes on. In an enterprise look at IT specialists and the security specialists it\u2019s one goal. If a system admin needs to patch a Linux or windows box, why? To mitigate risk. If a network engineer needs to configure a firewall rule to allow traffic to xyz port, why? To mitigate a risk. If a pen tester comes in and reads the scope of work and knows he/she can only try to infiltrate a certain application, system, etc. he/she is testing the security controls that were implemented. Cyber continuously monitors these things, and report on what is going on to effectively aid with decision makers on where to spend the money, on what to spend the money, and where to cut the budget. Cyber is a subset of IT I just think it\u2019s what do you want to do. There is IAM, least privilege, (ZERO TRUST), AAA there\u2019s just so much. I too was able to pull back from my cyber undergrad program because I landed 2 internships and now I am in a permanent role with an impressive company doing the thing.

        "content": "Hey there, everyone. This is a REALLY long post, so I apologize in advance. I just feel like these questions are best to ask people with first-hand experience. Thank you for any insight.\n\nI've been strongly considering joining the military to gain experience in the field and to get my foot in the door. That being said, I have a little background, I am 30, I have a business degree, and I've been working in management roles over the last several years. I and a few coworkers were recently laid off about a month ago due to budget cuts with the company and I have had 0 luck landing another role, either they ghost me, they never reach out after the interview, never reach out in general or nothing at all happens. This has been with I would say 100s of applications. I am looking for a change career wise. I always wanted to do something with IT but never did for some reason. So I am looking at it like this is my biggest chance, and it's now or never. Is the military a good idea for this?\n\nQuestions here.\n\nWhat branch would be the best for cyber? How long are cyber contracts? Are they all 6 years in every branch?\n\nWhat branch would offer the best QoL? \nThis would more than likely only be one enlistment, so it's not something lifelong, so I understand it's the military, and I'll be in a barracks, etc. \n\nWhat branches training would be the best for cyber?\n I've read different things based on the training provided, failure rate, what happens if you fail, etc. Any first-hand experience would be very welcome.\n\nWhat would transition best to civilian life?\n I've read some branches give you alot of certs, and some don't. I've read basically all give you a clearance which alone is valuable. \n\nWhat branch would also fit my age better?\nI've heard people say to commission, but I don't have a degree in computer science or STEM, so it's not possible. I also want experience, training, and learning the field. Also, I get it. It's the military. People younger than me, older than me, etc. Again, I'm not really bothered about it. They put in the time.\n\n-So last question is there any branch that does their job more over another?\nI've read various posts where people said they learned maybe a year of experience vs. their 6 year contract. Due to being pulled away from their job, etc. \n\nThat being said, I'm only interested in IT/cyber. So I believe AirForce would be out because the chances I've read of getting it are not likely. Since it's a 1-10 or 1-15 dream sheet shot. Army, I've read you can pick. Navy, I've even read you can pick, so that's another option too.",
        "comments": [
            "I have a biased opinion because I am in the Navy, but I believe the best option would be an US Navy CWT (enlisted). If you were to try and commission as an officer (I don\u2019t believe the degree that you have matters), getting into the cyber job route is harder than most, plus you may not get a lot of hands on with the equipment/software. This is because as an officer you will focus more on admin work(paperwork) and management. Which is not a bad option if you wished to get out and go for IT/Cyber management.  \n\nJCAC like you said is a great program, and though yes you can sent to the needs of the Navy, typically you can still choose a rate that is closer to the Cyber field (IT, CTR, CTM). ALSO, you get multiple tries after failing an exam. It\u2019s not a one and done.\n\nI\u2019ll say again, CWT is the rate you would want to go for, none of the other CT ratings (CTT, CTR, CTM, CTI) are focused on Cyber like CWT.  \n\nMarines, and Air Force to my knowledge you can\u2019t pick your job/MOS.  \n\nIn the Navy you will only be in barracks for a short period of time (about 2 years), you\u2019ll make E5 quick as a CWT and be able to get housing out in town. Also if you get married you can do that sooner. \n\nFor QoL, unless you volunteer, most CWT\u2019s don\u2019t go on ships. And if you do, it will be on an Aircraft Carrier. Most Sailors don\u2019t enjoy the ship life and that\u2019s where a lot of the bitterness comes from.\n\nIMO, CWT is the best rate in the Navy, especially for civilian job opportunities once out, second being IT.\n\nI hope this helps!!",

It is extremely frustrating how much that is the answer to every question. The first schoolhouse you attend to qualify for cyber (besides boot camp and combat training) as a marine is JCAC (joint cyber analysis course) which trains with all the branches. Because of this I am decently well versed in what branches do what. As far as I can tell the Navy is a decent choice and they mostly do SOC analyst type work or Pen test type work. For Marines we do mostly things with routing and networking, which might translate into network engineering. The Marine corps has a GIANT block right now. It takes about a year and half just to get started on the pipeline and then it\u2019s another 9-10 months after that. TBH I don\u2019t know what kind of jobs the Army and Airforce do.

For example, if you want to do web application security, you gotta learn basic web applications, common architecture, and client-side and/or server-side programming languages. The best path is to start as a front-end/back-end web developer. Similarly, suppose you want to secure a cloud environment. In that case, you gotta be a cloud engineer first to learn and gain knowledge working with that cloud environment, understanding the cloud model, responsibilities, deployment pattern, how it works, and so on.\n\nThere is no shortcut in cybersecurity.",

If you had more IC(pentest/appsec etc) sort of skills then you'd have a better chance imo. Also don't shy away from in-person roles, I've had many jobs where after showing up for couple months and proving I can get the job done the company was fine with me working from home when I wanted.\n\nMaybe you could you approach companies/take jobs as a consultant. That allows you some freedom to dictate how you work.\n\nFor finding work nothing beats in-person events right now. Companies are being bombarded with online applications so you'll basically be tossing your resume into a AI filtering void. Try local bsides or any tech event, you might get a referral.\n\nTry doing some \"thought-leadership\" on LinkedIn and connect with senior team members of nearby companies. Get on their radar.",

I worked on HMI systems, RSLogix 5000, and PLC's, in relation to gas turbine engines.\n\n\\- VBA, Fortran, and Matlab programming experience, from university.\n\n\\- In 2014 I started an Amazon FBA business, doing wholesale, my own products, and also representing various brands on Amazon, managing their whole brand image on there, and all the logistics that go with having their products fulfilled by Amazon FBA.\n\n\\- Also created my own product brand that actually did well (until I got attacked by a competitor, and the factory in China threw away my $4000 moulds due to not ordering for a year b/c of said competitor attack).\n\n\\- Started shopify store, designing the shopify store.\n\n\\- Creating listings on amazon for mine and other companies, optimizing them for amazon SEO.\n\n\\- Running Amazon PPC ads, creating Amazon PPC campaigns.\n\n\\- Created my own automated tool to create Amazon PPC campaigns using VBA programming\n\n\\- Dealing with vendors, creating relationships with new vendors, companies, and manufacturers to represent them on amazon and negotiate exclusivity contracts.\n\n\\- Travel to China to visit factory, do inspection, meet vendors, negotiate terms, etc.\n\n\\- Had a patent issue as someone attacked one of my vendors for his patent (and attacked me to enforce his exclusivity in the market) and I had to deal with all of that, and subsequent fallout.\n\n\\- Active in the investing space, studying economic cycles and such, much beyond the scope of regular investing, not sure if that would fit into a cybersecurity career.\n\n\\- I\u2019ve also taught English in Spain, and can speak fluent Spanish and Polish. I could learn another language quite fast if need be. I\u2019m good at teaching and enjoy it.\n\nI guess I have analysis paralysis on how to implement this into a resume. Just not sure where to even start.",

            "There's a lot to think about here, and I'll be blunt, nothing really in your post aligns to a security role. You have a degree from almost 15 years ago, which is nice, but so does everyone else. First I think you should try to define what security even means to you, from a job sense. Since you didn't mention anything about that I'm going from the assumption that you either don't know, or you think you'll be hacking things. It's a very wide field, with a ton of different specialties within it, there is no single type of \"cybersecurity job\". \n\nAlso, you're picking a terrible time to try to get into the tech space at all, not sure how much you follow this sub, or /r/ITCareerQuestions  but it's overflowing with people with degrees, internships, experience and certifications who can't even get interviews right now. \n\nI'm not saying it's impossible that you learn a bunch of stuff and happen to luck into something, but it's highly unlikely. The resume step is far down the road for you. Sorry for sounding harsh but I'm trying to be realistic and a lot of people see \"millions of unfilled jobs in security!\" and think it's easy to get one.",
            "Not trying to be mean but ill second the notion that nothing on your resume seems to qualify you for a security role. \n\nLike most people trying to get into security, you'll *likely* have to play the long game of getting an entry level IT job (like helpdesk) and progressing from there. Security is typically regarded as an \"advanced\" specialty within IT and the fact is that most people just don't jump into security as their first IT job. There are obviously exceptions but they're just that; exceptions",
            "Well that is a lot of stuff, but absolutely none of it really relevant to IT/Security work\n\nMaybe it is time to go to grad school for whatever you want your next career to be, but its not going to be security related",
            "There is a lot of interesting experience here, esp. related to business and product management.  Props to someone who was willing to have a go on their own, and hustle to do that.  But not seeing anything security related, and most of that has no place in a IT resume outside of the automated tool for PPC, or a passing mention of VBA and Fortran (lol).  \n\nIs that PPC tool code in github for me to see?  \n\nMore importantly, can you tell us what IT security does?  like in a nuts-and-bolts sense, what you think the day-to-day of the job is?  What are the different IT Sec roles?  Because if/when you know that, you'll be able to see the parallels to your listed experiences.  Looking at what is written above my only takeaway is that you don't have any idea what actually happens in cybersec if you think some of that is relevant.  \n\nThe saying \"Entry-level Cybersec is mid-level IT\" is not 100% true, but kinda.  As it stands, you're not really even entry-level IT, either, though some of the VB is a good start.  Like could you troubleshoot a basic Active Directory issue?  \n\nFor an IT manager role?  different story, there could be some options for Delivery Manager or PM or something.  Some of the formal engineering experience might help if you wanted to go the Dev role."

        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nA question I often get during interviews is: *'Why, as a girl, did you choose this field?'* or *'Pentesting/SOC is very challenging for girl'* or *'You should consider pursuing risk management/QA/QC/BA instead.'*\n\nI graduated last December with a major in Cyber Security. Before that, I spent two years studying Computer Networking and Communication, specializing in areas like networking, cables, and network infrastructure.\n\nHere\u2019s a brief overview of my experience:\n\n* 1 year as a SOC Analyst, handling both SOC Tier 1 responsibilities \u2013 it significantly impacted my health.\n* 6 months working in R&D for SOC products and services.\n* 3 months as a Security Auditor.\n* Currently, I\u2019m handling Incident Response for a state-owned company while also working as an *\"outsource auditor\"* (essentially doing internal audits for a company that outsources the task).\n\nAt the moment, I\u2019m looking to transition into a role in DevOps/DevSecOps or Cloud Security.\n\n* If I were to change jobs now, I\u2019m honestly still unsure about what my next position should be or how I should plan my career path. Would I be confident in that decision? \n* I'm considering studying for the AWS CO3 certification and learning more about DevOps. But is it a good idea to dabble in a bit of everything?\n* Has anyone ever made a similar role transition? What did you need to prepare? I\u2019d greatly appreciate any advice or insights. \n\nI\u2019d be happy to connect and learn from everyone here.",

            "Soooo, if you're getting \"*'Pentesting/SOC is very challenging for girl'*\", then I'd be in touch with someone for some legal advice. That said....\n\nDuring my career  all I did was study different security subjects. If I found something interesting I would dive in a learn more. I have so many certifications its not even funny. The only ones that mean anything are CISSP and OSCP. And thats questionable. Just study different fields but make sure to learn the basics (networking, sys admin, coding, sec policy, etc). Even if its only an inch deep. I've worked as a SOC analyst (t1-3), threat hunter, pentester, auditor, uav reverse engineer, and now at a ciso capacity that still gets about 40% hands-on. I went from on-prem bare metal servers to cloud.\n\nLooking at your experience, 1 year in SOC, 3 months in auditing isn't really much time at all. I noticed there is no helpdesk experience or sys admin in there (most of us started here).\n\nDefinitely learn a cloud (everything is cloud now), I find the knowledge to transfer easy once you get the concepts, albeit a small learning curve. AWS CO3 isn't a beginner cert, if you don't have cloud experience I suggest hitting the CCP first.\n\nAs far as devops goes, do you enjoy collaborating across teams, testing, implementing tech, rinse and repeat? I know thats a high level there. I enjoy working with other teams, I serve as an SME to the devs where Im at. I learn a ton from them.\n\nPlan your path with what you really like. But don't forget to stop and learn new things along the way. But yes, dabble in EVERYTHING, it will help you immensely in the future. Even if it seems pointless now. Early on someone told me I should learn Python or Java and I was like \"meh, when will I use that\". Well, it turns out, just about every security job I've had. I was lucky enough to find Linux very early on, when wifi adapters didn't work without a lot configuration changes.  That helped me with scripting and understanding how the OS works. It's the little things.\n\n  \n\\*\\*Edited to say this, don't just grab certs to feel good and brag. Take your time to learn the material, I would sooner hire someone that spent 6 months studying for CISSP than a 7 day boot camp. I never did boot camps as I couldn't afford them early on or my employer wouldn't pay.",
            "WTF. If one of my colleagues said anything about the gender of someone interviewing I\u2019d stop the interview and apologize for this person and have a talk with them and HR later. That\u2019s a red flag",
            "so im similar to you currently soc analyst but always been eyeing cloud security\n\nim planning to go down the azure route and just tick off all the certs while building labs on everything I learn as part of my portfolio  \nand then cover some general devops tech like k8, linux, docker, go etc",
            "Those interviewers asking why you chose this field \"as a girl\" or suggesting you should pursue less technical roles are completely out of line. Your gender has absolutely nothing to do with your abilities or career choices in cybersecurity or any tech field. You've already gained impressive experience across SOC, R&D, auditing, and incident response roles. That diverse background puts you in a great position to transition into DevOps/Cloud Security if that's where your interests lie.\n\nPursuing the AWS CO3 certification and learning more about DevOps are excellent next steps. Focus on building practical skills with cloud platforms, infrastructure-as-code, CI/CD pipelines, and security automation. Many organizations are looking for security professionals who can bridge the gap between traditional InfoSec and modern DevOps practices. Your incident response experience will be particularly valuable in a DevSecOps role. Don't let anyone discourage you from following your interests and leveraging your technical skills.\n\nBy the way, I'm on the team that created an [interview AI assistant](http://interviews.chat), a tool designed to help people navigate tricky interview questions. It provides real-time suggestions during online interviews to help you confidently showcase your qualifications."
