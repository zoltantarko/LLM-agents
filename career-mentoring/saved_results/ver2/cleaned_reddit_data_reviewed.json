    "title": "All my IT friends discourage me (40M) from a career change to IT.",
    "content": "So, several times in my career over the years, I have contemplated a switch to an IT career. My focus would be networks and/or security. My father in an IT lifer and have several good friends in the IT field. I myself am an industry biologist. While I absolutely love science and am passionate about my work, some toxic work environments I have found myself in have pushed me to go in a different direction.  IT has always one of those things I think I could be really happy doing. I have always had a knack for understanding computers and how to troubleshoot them, I have never ventured beyond the hobbyist sort of computer nerd. I have always wanted to step up my credentials in my desired path and become a professional.\n\nEach time I try, my IT buddies are always a bit pessimistic. Before now, say about 10 years ago, the reaction was \"You will not make a lot of money starting out in IT\" and various other arguments about starting IT from the bottom. BTW, the money in biology isn't great either. But if your a science nerd like me, biological lab and field work can be rewarding. \n\nSo now, at 40, and again in a toxic environment and industry job, I am looking to make an exit and find another passion to pursue professionally. Now, my friends say that I have no chance to beat out a recent college grad with no experience for a job. The idea is that put a recent college grad with little to no xp vs a motivated 40 year old with little to no xp, HR will always go with the college grad, hands down. So it seems they are telling me that I missed the boat and stick to biology.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Would it be a waste of time to seek out some certifications and head for the nearest help desk wanted ad?\n\nEdit: Some great advice and feeling the reddit love. But want to clear up one topic. I know the money won't be anywhere near what I make now. I have an established career and some serious credentials backing up my experience currently. I am not looking for a change to make the money. I want the change to reinvigorate me. I want a job that I can learn and growth with in something new and exciting (for me). I also know that toxic work environments are everywhere. I just am just stuck in one right now and that is what is spurring the change.",

      "I'm 38, went back to school at 35 and got my associates degree in CIS/MIS. Graduated a year ago. I'm finishing up my second contracted project this month and starting my first direct hire IT role next month in desktop support. Ill be enrolling in the fall to pursue my bachelor's as well. I also have a wife and 3 kids, one of them being just 3 weeks old. \n\nThe point of that is...fuck your friends. \n\nGo for it. \n\nIf I can do it then so can you.",
      "Why do you care what your friends think? If they're not ambitious, that's their problem. You can make plenty of money as a 40 year old just starting in IT. Go for it.",
      "You have a STEM degree, you have a good story to tell, you (presumably) have a work ethic that will enable you to be successful.  Go for it.",
      "Dude what? You clearly don't like your current job much, what do you have to lose? Just do it. Also, your pay will scale very quickly with some experience.",
      "Ill play devils advocate here. I think your friends have some valid but misdirected points.\n\n1. While its not like this everywhere, there is absolutely toxic work environments/cultures in IT. Especially when I first stared in IT I had a few jobs that were based off of favoritism, there was a lot of gatekeeping by upper management, they expected us to do unpaid on-call, work holidays, stay late, etc. \n\nNot all companies are like that. Id wager most arent, but they do exist and you probably wont know until your already in it. It tends to happen in more jr roles but can happen nonetheless. Read about burnout at FAANG companies as well.\n\n2. You could leverage your experience in some ways to go into IT, but without any verifiable skills/background you could be taking a cut from where your at pay and title wise. Not always the case, but its a possibility.\n\n3. There are parts of IT that are boring. If you like doing field work, you may not like sitting in an office doing routine work.\n\n4. Understand IT, especially in the entry level area, is very oversaturated and competitive right now. Thats not to say there is no chance to break in, but there is a industry around funneling people into IT and there has been a drastic spike of people trying to get into the field especially since Covid started. Look at r/Comptia, this sub, and some other IT related subs growth over the past few years and youll see. The downside is employers see this. Youll be competing with people half your age and x2 your level of experience which can be frustrating. Being older though, you can bring a unique perspective to things. It can just take time to get in the door.\n\n5. Adding a bit to points 1 & 2. The pay can be a let down in those entry level roles. Your best bet is to get some experience then job hop to get a better salary. With that said, you could easily be in a position where you have to take a drastic pay cut just to get experience and depending on things outside of work (family, kids, living situation) this can be a downside. Very few come right into the industry and get 6 figure salaries. The majority have to climb there way up to that despite what YouTubers and tech articles will make you think.\n\nIm not saying that IT is a bad route. You can and should look at it, but be aware of what was mentioned above. Id say maybe get some certifications while you continue to work and see if you really like it. There is a huge difference between being a computer nerd and the workings of an enterprise environment. Certs can give you a brief taste of what youll be doing and what to learn.\n\nWhatever you do, best of luck! IT can be very rewarding, but I try not to see it with rose colored glasses. There are plenty of 40 year olds that switch and do okay, you can too if you put in the work. I may be biased but I think you should give it a try if youre really passionate about it. I wish you nothing but success!",
      "Sounds like you should make the move, but you left out some key information.  A career change will likely result in a salary reduction.  Entry level help desk gigs don't pay that much typically (depending on location).  Will you be able to make ends meet if your salary gets significantly reduced (at least for the first couple of years)?",
      "I think the biggest challenge is going to be convincing HR or a hiring manager that you're really looking for a career change and aren't expecting big bucks. \n\nMore often than not -- and regardless of the candidate's age -- when I've taken a chance on interviewing someone for an entry-level IT position, we hit a \"But that's less than I make now\" stumbling block that's discouraging for everyone.\n\n(Incidentally, I'm very up front about what different roles pay, but that rarely stops people from thinking that the top of the range is the floor for negotiation.)",
      "Have you considered merging your experience in Industrial Biology and Technology? The emerging field of Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning requires a high level of math, and other science backgrounds to develop, deploy, and innovate in the field of research and more. It's a combination of IT, CS, and Hard Science which you may be able to find space within and leverage your industry experience especially since it's not well established.\n\nRoles like Bioinformatics Scientist, Machine Learning, Machine Learning Scientist, Biostatistician, AI Engineer. Even if it's not in the Industrial Biology space, your understanding of hard science is a valuable tool that could potentially help you move into another role in similar salary that combines your knowledge and experience and passion, with a chance to innovate. \n\n**Some references:**\n\n* What is Machine Learning? https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/overview-what-is-azure-machine-learning\n* AWS How I Started a Career in Machine Learning - No PHD Required https://youtu.be/cC8A5VmEVtg\n* Life as an AI Researcher & Machine Learning Engineer - J.P.

      "Say you start at the bottom, learn all you can and surely you can move up. Everyone starts somewhere. You're still going to be working for another 20-25 years; that's a lot of time to be doing something you enjoy. Go get it!!",
      "So listen, if youre unhappy you have 2 choices; make a change or remain unhappy. Its that easy. Yeah, if you get into IT at helpdesk or junior admin level youll make probably around 40k give or take depending on your city/country. Not amazing but not end of the world awful. There are still bad work environments in IT and I have been part of them, but there are good ones too. If you believe IT is something youll enjoy, then go for it. :)\n\nEdit: my fat thumbs cant type on this Little Rock we tricked into thinking.",

      "I'm 30 years old. Never went to a university. However, at this age I finally found out what I want my occupation to be for the rest of my life. I want to be an archaeologist. I messed up my life. I barely finished high-school as a mechatronics technician because of physical diseases and a poor spirit I had at the time.. I've been told by a good friend of mine that I don't have a moral fortitude to make it to a university, much less to finish it. He is right.\n\nBut I don't care. I want this. I already made certain steps towards reaching that goal. Moved to a city where there is such an university. Found a job and am renting an apartment. It is a city I wanted to live in. I didn't know whether I would make it this far. I believed in the Lord that He would provide as He wishes, and today, here I am. I won't back down simply because the task seems impossible given the lack of my character and whatnot. I'll fight for it. \n\nThe point of the story, just as it was mentioned: if you really want to change your career, your life, for the better, don't listen to those who would discourage you from doing it. Hear their counsel, pick the flowers, leave the weeds; recognize your errors, evaluate your strengths, and keep pressing on! :)\n\nI wish you a successful journey. :D",
      "I live in rural Illinois, and part of what I do is teach at a small tech college. This year I had students with an AAS degree get jobs starting at $45,000 or more, and included benefits. This is not the Chicago area either, nor the best students. \n\nIf you have a passion for IT, do it.",
      "Your friends are giving you shit advice... You can easily beat out a college grad with no experience because you do have decades of real work experience. Shifting to IT isn't some magical mystery subject, it's just another professional field and learning it is just like learning anything else. Given the choice between hiring a guy with 15-20 years professional experience and no IT experience vs a 20 year old with no professional experience and no IT experience, I'm hiring the guy with professional experience every time.",
      "I career changed from Marketing to IT at the age of 38, so pretty close to you.\n\nI didn't ask for anyone's permission.\n\nNow granted I was already starting from zero (laid of in the 2008 bloodbath) stringing together multiple part-time jobs including working swing shift at Walmart, when I made the jump to IT.\n\nAre you applying for jobs and your friends are the hiring managers? Your buddies will be interviewing you? No?\n\nThen you owe it to yourself to make an effort at least. It doesn't sound like you can drop everything and start bootcamping certs, blogging your github homelab on youtube while volunteering to fix the \"IT\" at your local church like is always suggested around here. You'll have to get things dones within the context of your current career. \n\nNow, I'm not saying you should not listen to your friends. In fact, I'm curious as to why ALL of them (?) are telling you not to do it. What's left unsaid by all of them? Do they know you pretty well? Honestly that could be a bad sign, when all of them are telling you not to. Do you have a blind spot? Are they being \"nice\" and not telling you about some glaring thing they see that means IT is not in the cards for you? All of them say don't do it?\n\nCurious.\n\nAlso, you've mentioned toxic environments twice now. What are the componenets of these toxic environments that you're experiencing? It's possible that there are toxic environments in every career field. \n\nAt 40 you'll need to explore EVERY facet at hand. You, current state of your present career, current state of IT, You, future state of your present career, You, future state of IT, and mostly You....getting the picture?\n\nYou can do it. Apparently a lot of people are telling you not you, you might want to listen...and more importantly you might want to ask them some pointed questions.\n\nLike I always tell my boys, wherever you go  there *you* are. Ask tough questions, explore, plan, and I think you can do it.\n\nGood luck!",

      "My father in an IT lifer and have several good friends in the IT field. - yes change now. They can help at least provide a career plan what to learn, what jobs are best, maybe a reference or refferal etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou will not make a lot of money starting out in IT\" - yes true. Read it again if you dont believe. Do some market research and consult salaries with your biology. As I said above, consult with your contacts on possible career maps and realistic times to advance and approximate your salary earnings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n have always had a knack for understanding computers and how to troubleshoot them, - honestly a knack for googling is way more useful than whatever that \\^ implies. Im serious, googling as a netowrk engineer/noc, googling as a devops, googling as a software dev. Lots of googling and being good at it is extremely useful. So patience will be needed. YOu may have to do 10 things at once and you are tired and its been going on like this for 6 hours non stop seriously lol. You should take notes of everything so you can be on point and advance without going back or forgetting stuff. At the same time, while googling you should maintain the clearhead and focus to read in detail everything on the page because often its the random that dont seem to have the answer that may be the key to solve your query, be it they hold the answer in weird non obvious wording, or they give you an idea where to look at next. \n\nyou dont need passion. what psychopath has passion for searching cisco bugs, or kubernetes and azure. computer passionate people are probably people who build PCs and play world of warcraft and instagram. IT job is different. \n\nSometimes your ability to asses a situation logically and properly, may be asssessed while on the phone.",
      "If you love and are passionate about the work that you are currently doing then maybe a change in workplace is necessary if you feel its toxic.\n\nI wouldn't encourage you to get into IT at 40 if you still love the work that you currently do.\n\nYou may come into the field and find a different kind of toxicity. From what I've noticed, IT professionals work behind the scenes and non-IT staff don't understand or consider the challenges that IT professionals experience so we end up having to learn conflict resolution when dealing with other people, because essentially they are all having a problem if they are asking for help. People get frustrated when things don't work correctly and often times IT professionals take the brunt of that.\n\nBut if you really want to make the switch because its time for a change, then absolutely go for it. Its just fundamental knowledge that you need to get into the field. However experience & knowledge advances you so if you want to move up, you will need to learn the technical stuff. I would expect that you have picked up on some essential soft skills already that will help you move up faster.",

      "I went from doing physical security to IT. I was working a security gig and had nothing but time on my hands. I could show up to work and watch Netflix all day for 8 hours if I wanted. Right at the beginning of the pandemic, I knew I wanted to get into IT. I followed Kevtech and Jobskillshare on YouTube and followed their playlist. I mean I binged and watched it like a Netflix series. Once I felt confident, I then posted on the Nextdoor app throughout my local neighborhood Offering free IT services. I knew I was onto something big. Within minutes I had 50+ requests for various IT-related tasks. I went to Freshdesk and built out a domain so anytime I would get an email - a ticket would automatically be created and I could streamline it to the customer. In the beginning, Ive done everything from network deployments to malware removal and everything in between. I now work at a local hospital as a level 2 desktop support technician- which is my first IT job at age 31. You can do anything you put your mind to. If I can do it then quite literally anyone can. Best of luck",
      "I'd like to ask you to elaborate on your toxic work environments. What is it that's so toxic? Do you have difficulty dealing with toxic people? That may be why your friends are pushing you away from IT, dealing with toxic people is a cornerstone of this profession. You will deal with assholes having a bad day that expect you to make everything better every day. \n\nI have a friend who has social anxiety and issues and does not deal w people. He asks me if he should get into IT and I tell him no because of his inability to deal with hostile people he will match their energy and cuss people out he dgaf so he isn't cut out for this.\n\nYou don't make it sound like you are passionate about IT, it sounds like you just want to work somewhere that isn't toxic, IT will likely be MORE toxic and if that is your primary drive I'd say your friends are right and this is not a career change worth making.",

      "Better to be 40 and switching careers to one you love than 50 and burnt out and wanting to switch careers with little left in you to one that you'll enjoy but lost the passion for everything...\n\nI say do it. It's a great career, and although the entry level pay and responsibilities can be crap, you can easily move up. Just don't get in that rut to where if you do the job you'll move up. You have to be very proactive. Learn new things outside of your job description, ask the next level tier stuff and take on some of their work if possible. Just keep trying to move forward and it comes pretty quickly. \n\nIf you get into IT and don't like it, you still have a good background in biology. If you still enjoy biology and IT, there's some parts of the field that intersect (different then The Intersect, which Chuck used).",

Good luck if you do make a change.",
      "Im 39. No IT degree just criminal justice. Just got an entry lvl network admin job. \n\nIt can be done bro. If you want it go for it. Yea the pay might suck for 2 years but so what.",
      "First off, eveyone has a shot of making it in any given position. The only thing that matters is professionalism and experience. If you're looking to get into the industry then an entry level help desk position or entry level tech position is a good place to start. If you're going to try any IT job then you gotta stay hungry. Don't get comfortable. You're there to learn on the job while continuing your education for about a year or two. If you don't have it then the A+ cert is a good place to start. The cert will give you more weight during the application process, it also tells employers that you understands the fundamentals of how a computer works and how to troubleshoot issues. If you're set on getting into networking then you can get your Network + cert and then the CCNA cert. Some may say to just go straight to the CNNA but that depends on your knowledge of how networking works. You can think of the Network + cert as a per-algebra class, it lays the ground work and fundamentals of networking.",
      "I'm 43.  Went back to school at 38 and graduated at 41 with an Associate's in Information Technology.  I worked for an ISP for 14 years and developed some good foundational knowledge of networks and troubleshooting.  I landed my first MSP job a year ago last March then left for a Systems Admin position this past December.  \n\nYou can do this.  You're not too old.  Depending on what you make, it may be a cut at first, but a solid 5 years plan of learning and obtaining certifications could out you in the 6 figure range no problem.  If it makes you happy, nothing anyone says should make a damn bit of difference.  Go for it.",
      "It's never a waste of time to try to better yourself and your situation.\n\nYou are in a difficult position in terms of having a certain salary level to maintain, the flood of recent IT graduates and blue-collar workers who've been convinced IT is an easy upgrade. \n\nMy suggestion to someone who already has a college degree and a career is to leverage that.  Find a way to work some practical IT experience into your current job and/or explore your field/industry for IT opportunities.  If it doesn't develop into a position, it can at least put some practical experience on your resume. \n\nCan't speak to biology as I'm unfamiliar with the field, but I might advise a sales guy to put together business analytics projects and build that into an IT analytics specialty.  Sometimes there's specialized equipment that has an IT component that you can build expertise in, or maybe you can build web based applications for your department that could lead toward a web dev position. \n\nI know I'm being a bit vague, but to me that's the best path for someone who already has a degree and familiarity with an industry.",
      "I'm 38 and am going back to school for an IT-related degree after several interviews for entry-level positions went disastrously because they were looking at my (unrelated to IT) degrees and laser-focusing on that instead of seeing that I used to teach what was basically A+ material as part of a job assistance program. I'm totally okay with the inevitable pay cut but I totally get what you mean. I'll be over 40 once I finish and female on top of that. \n\nI'm still going to give it a shot with some certs and a bachelor's degeee. At least I'll have my current career to fall back on if it doesn't work out but I'm kicking myself for not pursuing it the first time around like I'd wanted to.",

But those new grads can lose out to experienced people, and those experienced people lose to those with a degree AND experience.\n\nJob offers are usually contingent upon you being the best candidate who interviewed. But there's more to it than credentials, and there IS an appeal to having mature people in your office rather than all kids. \n\nYou CAN get into IT. You CAN make good money. There will always be better candidates out there. But they won't always be in the same place at the same time. Sometimes, you'll be the best pick.",

Diversity maintains the success and creativity in any field",

Took Core 1 (twice) passed on my second try in October 2021. Passed Core 2 and got my A+ certification February 2022.  Now, I'm about to start my entry level job at Amazon as an IT Support Associate II. I went full circle in a way.\n\nI belong to the hotel service industry field for 25 years. My IT experience in the business is good enough for me to be categorized as \"my IT experience\" where 25% of daily operations I deal with IT related issues.  I realized the demands of the job working as a Hotel General Manager moving-on will be too much for me (the stress oh my!), as the job itself is going from bad to worst. So I decided to get into IT and I am fortunate to be given a job offer by Amazon.  It is an entry level position, but I am confident and motivated that in about 1-2 years IT experience and the more certs achieved I'll be able to move up and level-up. \n\nDon't listen to your friends.

      "I think you should chance it. Build the life you want. I started selling real estate in 2015, prior to that I was a wanna-be because of all sorts of reasons. Plainly I just didn't have the cajones. Everyone told me, \"No, don't do it,\" and I also had my own fear of failure. So I started part-time. All I cared about was to cover my costs, and making money was a bonus! \n\nNow, I make enought to cover costs AND go on trips AND put away a few bucks for a rainy day. In hindsight it was the best decision. I still have the day job, but it is just a job. Yes it provides PTO, insurance, and all those other benefits, but it still is just a job. When my peers get negative around me I tell them about real estate. Lol, kills the coversation every time. \n\nAnother childhood dream was to be an IT guy too. In 2019 I started down that rabbit hole too. It has been slower because I didn't stay forcused and I like plinking on tryhackme and watching Network Chuck and Health Adams. In February I got my Net+, and working on my Sec+ now. \n\nMy goal is to combine my sales skills with IT as a sales engineer - that is my sweet spot imo.

People calling about their problems. Network Admin? people on your network calling about their problems. Cyber Security? People calling about problems you made and now you have to fix them. Developers? Executives giving you more problems.\n\nDon't get me wrong though. I'm a problem solving type of guy and I don't mind it. But again, most people with a problem are not having a good day. IT can get toxic, really fast.\n\nIf you decide to go with it, get some certs and do it while keeping your current job. Build a home lab to get familiar with things.

You will go further faster given you have understanding of the field and how to best support their objectives from an IT perspective.  When I used to run a small team of field service techs for researchers, I would have loved to have someone with your background, even perhaps being 15 years older than other starters.\n\nAnother gambit is if you know if your current workplace orders software/hardware from certain IT vendors.  They sometimes are interested in taking on entry level IT sales roles to people who know how the org operates and what the business needs are vs. some 20 year IT guy who knows more Cisco commands than how to get a researcher to buy products.\n\nOverall I just think its good to find value/use in your current experience, even if you are moving to IT, instead of just starting from scratch.",

Then to show that you have some knowledge or proficiency in a more specialized area.  Generalist types can find jobs - but specialization in IT is what gets you paid.  \n\nDepending on the organization - moving up can be easy or impossible (at least with actual titles and pay raises).  Smaller orgs you can \"cap out\".  Lots of places are looking to underpay.

For sure, no way around that. Especially at your age. 40 is still young, but it doesn't matter what the crowd says lol. What does your body tell you when you get up in the morning and your bones are literally talking out loud to you. Sounding like a bowl of rice crispies just walking to the bathroom lol.\n\nIn your 20's, all-nighters and studying for 18+ hours a day wasn't a big deal. But try doing that NOW. I'm only 32, and if I miss just an hour of sleep I'm basically a zombie the next day. I know everybody wants to sound tough and say it's not that hard but lets be real here. Then on top of all that you have to account for family time and other life responsibilities. \n\nYES - There is a lot of money in IT IF you're willing to put in that kind of work, and not give up.\n\nYES - it can be rewarding if you like tech (only in certain fields though).\n\nYES - IT jobs can be pretty secure depending on what you pursue. \n\nBut again it really comes down to what you're capable, and willing to do in order to get there. \n\nThe only times I'd actively discourage it is if: \n\n1: You're not a driven person, you'll get nowhere in IT as it's heavily driven by the workers work ethics. If you're lazy, you're not gonna go anywhere unless you know someone. Tech isn't really something you can \"fall\" into. You have to search it out, make yourself competitive, and apply yourself on some level. \n\n2: If you're not wiling to learn with the evolving industry. Tech is one of the most evolving fields in the world, what you learn today has a chance to be completely irrelevant tomorrow. So if you want one of those \"sit in my chair and watch YouTube all day\" kind of jobs, either become a network engineer, or stay away. Even low end entry level Help Desk jobs do more work then that and deal with evolving tech.\n\n\\--------------------------\n\nTLDR; \n\nIf you're doing it for personal reasons, then go for it!

      "Man, and here I am sitting at 40-years-old in IT and think about making a switch to something else like being a groundskeeper!",
      "Theyre probably (mostly) concerned about the pay cut you would take.\n\nYoure in your 40s, and presumably, well into your career.  If one of my friends (were upper 30s) said they were going to jump from their career paths and get into ITwell, Id hope they have all their ducks in a row.  \n\nIm upper 30s and six figures.  Some of the guys that have entered our company are under $25 an hour, entry level.  \n\nJust be prepared.  And, I wouldnt fault your friends much.  Im guessing (again) that theyd be concerned about the money aspect more than anything.",
      "I got in at 25 an earned shit for about 4 years, jumped to a \"good\" salary at that point, and now 7 years in I'm on a well above average salary.\n\nThe main things you need are:\n\n- Ambition\n- A willingness to learn and actually do the hard work. You will need to play around with tech at home, work likely won't train you into a high earning role so it's up to you to obtain those skills independently\n- A smart and strategic view of your career map. Lots of people are good at tech, but to really be successful you can't rely on luck alone. You need to view your career strategically - if you take X job you can learn skills Y and Z which are in demand for the job youd like to have in 2 years time, etc. For your first job it won't matter so much but for every subsequent job you should be looking at this",
      "Why not just get another job in your field, do you have a college degree?",
      "I studied microbiology in university and wound up working for a genetics research complex, you make no money in the field if you dont pursue medicine typically.\n\nMade the change to IT, got my bachelors, did help desk for 6 months, then landed a cybersecurity analyst position. Had my 2nd interview for hopefully my first ever pentration testing job today.\n\nYou can go far in this field in short tine. Your friends are right, the money in entry level IT sucks. The key is to minimize your time in entry IT through hard work and continued education.",
      "You can change, and its your life, do what you want.  However changing careers at 40 can and will be difficult because you have to learn a whole bunch of info that may not be applicable everyday.\n\nMoney will come back and if you can tolerate the temporary financial set back, then youll be fine.",
      "Unless you got solid skills already just know youre starting from the bottom rungs of the ladder - which dont pay well and can be pretty hellish. \n\nGet some certs before diving in. \n\nAge doesnt mean jack in IT - competency does.",
      "I mean they're right about the money starting out, help desk isn't great pay. Tbh though, I'm 6 months in and enjoying it a lot more than I thought.\n\nThere's upsides and downsides, and like every industry, everyone in it likes to talk shit about it lol. Don't think it'll be the answer to all your problems, but you can definitely do it if you want. There's some ageism, but it's kinda reversed if you want to get in the management side lol\n\nIn short: entry level pay bad, but entry level job is definitely attainable at your age, do what you wanna do",
      "Money isn't the problem, the problem people have in IT is they have no passion for it. If money is the main goal of a career then you'll be miserable. That should never be the focus. Entry level IT jobs are decent around like 40 - 60k. Past that it can go up to 100k in some jobs, there are also a minority of jobs in IT that make at least 150k. But again, money should never be the goal at all. You can make a lot but end up hating the job. If you have no passion for IT and just want to do it cause every fucking person is doing IT (pun intended) then don't enter the field. This field is saturated because everyone is greedy and just wants to earn a lot of money and not learn shit in the field then they'll eventually fail and whine and complain that IT is bad. Its a field not for everyone. You have to have a desire to learn and keep learning till the day you retire. If you don't have that ability then don't enter the field because this is a field that is constantly evolving and growing till the end of this universe. Take several IT courses and learn stuff.\n\n If it doesn't interest you and something that bores you then forget IT you won't thrive in the field. Plan ahead, don't plan while you're doing something in IT. I think more than half of the people in IT are miserable and failing at their jobs because they have no interest in the field and are disappointed they aren't becoming a millionaire or something. This field is also a field that weeds people out very easily. If you don't know your shit and don't prepare enough, you won't get anywhere. If you have the dedication, passion and interest for IT then you'll be fine, if not then don't bother.",
      "If you are good at it could be rewarding, otherwise you're gonna be setting up computers for chump change. You know yourself better than reddit so what do you think?",
      "How important is a degree? Is there ever a point where experience trumps a degree?",
      "Your friend is speaking in absolutes that are not absolutely true. Yes its possible you could hit some speed bumps but it doesnt have to mean theres no hope. 2 of my last 3 hires were older than me at 40, 1 of them having left a different career and knowing he would take a pay cut. Oh and he has since gotten his sec+ and promoted into a junior cyber analyst role. \n\nThat guys experience? A little equivalent to geek squad 20 years prior and he a new online degree focused on database while working his other job.",
      "Wowsie, I guess the grass is always greener. I'd love a science job!!\n\nIT, IMO, feels kinda dead end to be honest - I always feel that I yearn for more, i'd love to be in something bigger. In my experience IT is obviously service based, the hidden backbone that's taken for granted until it fails.. It does sometimes just feel like groundhog day \"same shit, different day\", not actually creating something. Obviously this is all my experience, take with a pinch of salt, still valid nonetheless, regardless of what anyone says - We all have our own experience and opinions on working in this field.\n\nIt has its moments where you do a great job and remember why you chose IT, as some wizard...",
      "What do your friends know about what you have achieved and what knowledge you have?  Just go for it and give it a shot. With your science background, you will do fine.",

      "All of my IT friends have said go for it! Most of my online 'research says go for it. Just on reddit there are so many stories about savvy folks changing from a totally non-IT field and getting in the mix at noob positions or pivoting from the experience they have.\n\n\nI am on my 2nd short term help desk gig this year after selling cell phones for years. I started studying for Network+ last fall but I haven't gotten any cert so I tell interviewers I'm a noob but my studying let's me not sound like a poser, just a novice. I positioned my customer contact and previous call center time to get my foot in the door. I'm 55.",
      "Youre never too old to make a career switch. If you want to do it and you think it will bring a lot of positive change in your life then do it. \n\nBut I will say, if you feel like you are in a toxic work environment. Then apply for other positions in your field first! It may be possible that you find a fulfilling job with great coworkers, AND good pay within your field. A career change is a big step so definitely think it through. \n\nBest of luck.",
      "Yes you should switch to IT.  Long ago honestly.  Yes you should follow your passion and get in IT.  Even at 40yrs old you can grow exponentially.  If the world of IT is a hotel - IT people are on different floors such is there perspective shaped relative to the floor they are on.  Take a few classes and get a cert.  start off doing contracting work since youre not too concerned about the money.  The fastest way to grow is contract work W2 or 1099.  Turn that fear into your power and get out there.  Start living."

    "title": "Is a career change to cybersecurity worth it after 2023?",
    "content": "Hello, \nI've been seeing alot of youtube videos of layoffs in the tech field, and how hard it is for these people with years of experience to find a job. I'm worried that I made the wrong choice. I've been working in the kitchen for 10+ years, and during the pandemic I realized that I needed to find a more stable career. I've been in school as a computer information systems major/ minor statistics  because I initially wanted to pursue a field related to data. I've never even heard of data science befofe 2020 lol. But I found about cybersecurity, and from all the youtubers/dept of labor statistics, it seemed like this is a field that will grow tremendously and would be a stable career choice.It also seemed more accessible to older 2nd career adults. I took some elective classes for cybersecurity(networking/ aws) and I've been studying to get certifications. But now Im just seeing way too many people getting laid off and unable to get back in. I just don't want to waste my time.. im about to hit my mid 30s and I don't want to invest all this time and money to later be unemployed and still in the kitchen. So, for those working in the field, do you think this field will continue to stay like this...will it get worse or better?Also, Im kind of tired of hearing people say do it if it's your passion..don't do it for the money. I was watching an interview with one of the popular cybersec youtuber and even he was talking about how he personally know talented people who have been laid off and unemployed for months! \nHe said something along the lines of how they're able stay positive because it's their passion or whatever. But I've realized after trying to pursue my passion in pastry, in the end I chose stability over passion. And yes, I know I won't be making bank in this field, but having been paid shit money for the past 10 years and seeing the financial limits in the culinary field, simple livable income and room for growth is enough for me. Any input is appreciated and thank you for reading if you read all of this!",

      "I'm in the same boat as you. Over 50, this is my second career after 20 years bartending, after 12 years of freelance web design.\n\nCurrently working a pretty decent, remote help desk position (with no certs or previosu help desk experience). Just passed my Sec+, and looking to move into Security.\n\nHere's what I know so far...\n\n* When I look on Linked In, there are MANY security related jobs including SOC L1 and above.\n* Security is a general term with dozens of not hundreds of positions that cover anywhere from SOC, Pentesting, Governance-Risk-Compliance, Budgeting and economics, OSINT investigation...I mean the sky is literally the limit. So many ways to go. Personally love OSINT and want to see what I can do with it.\n* Just getting a Sec+ (or any cert) doesn't mean recruiters will be knocking down your door. You have to put the fundamentals on top of it to get a decent SOC job. TryHackMe and HackTheBox have some pretty good SOC related courses.\n* When I started my web design business, it was 2008. Everyone and their mother was trying to be a web designer back then. It was saturated. On top of that,  the world economy was shit. But I knew there were still people out there with money, and I was specializing in a specific thing and there was a need. Starting a business is hard, and there's NEVER a perfect time or perfect economy.   I made it work by becoming a better option and marketing myself well. I feel the same way about this. I need to become a better candidate than the average applicant with nothing but certs.\n\nAbout all that \"passion\" shit. I HATE that word now. If I wanted to follow my passion, I'd be a house music DJ and professional bourbon sampler at a beachside bikini and buffalo wing bar.\n\nI like IT and technology  in general. I like learning about it. Many things about it fascinates me and it seems I have a pretty good aptitude for it and learning new things. I've spent hours watching keynotes just because I find the shit interesting. I watch tech shows and podcasts more than streaming shows and movies. As far as things I would do for money, I think this is pretty awesome and it has opportunity.\n\nIf I wasn't doing this for a living, I'd still probably dabble with my home lab, and learn how to do stuff out of curiosity, but is it my passion? As in would I do it for someone else for free just because I love it so much? F\\*ck no. I'm here to make money. I will do and learn and become what I need to be to make that money..same as when I was a bartender. I loved tending bar. It was fun, I was living in Vegas and living like a true degenerate. It was great. But the money is part of what made it great.  I became the bartender I needed to be, and moved to where I needed to move, to make maximum money and have maximum fun.\n\nI see this (any job) the same way.  What do I need to do to be that guy that employers are looking for, and beat out the competition for that job, and then be able to kick ass and back it up?  Great, I'll do that.\n\nCould I do that for any job? Nope. I like this one.",
      "Infosec is not a 9 - 5 job.\n\nIt typically takes a tremendous amount of work and dedication to get into it in the first place and a lot of effort to progress because the stakes are so high.\n\nFirst read this:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/zrd5c7/roadmap\\_to\\_careers\\_in\\_cybersecurity\\_and\\_cloud/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/zrd5c7/roadmap_to_careers_in_cybersecurity_and_cloud/)\n\nThen this:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/12fwatv/comment/jfia9le/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/12fwatv/comment/jfia9le/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)",
      "**edit for perspective**  30 year veteran of systems engineering (OS2--> Windows --> Linux) and now Solutions Architect \n\nIt's not that the money isn't important, but the primary question everyone who considers Infosec FAILS to ask themselves is \"What do I love to do\"? \n\nIn my experience (non-infosec by CHOICE) there are two primary roles for Infosec experts at most enterprisees.\n\n1.  Triage - Fighting fires\n2.  Audit and Nag (God this is a thankless job where you're setup to fight ALL DAY)\n\nNEITHER of these is why I joined IT.  I have a passion for creating solutions for a business using technology.  New solutions doing amazing things.  I'll NEVER consider an infosec carrer, but applaud those for whom it's their passion.  \n\nSo OP.... What's your passion?\n\nG~",
      ">Also, Im kind of tired of hearing people say do it if it's your passion..don't do it for the money.

But I've realized after trying to pursue my passion in pastry, in the end I chose stability over passion.\n\nI respect this and I think you *can* make it with this attitude, BUT a big piece of cyber security is trying to solve a problem and thinking outside the box to get there. It has been my experience that those who are there for the money tend to lack in this skill. You might find yourself being passed up if you don't take this part seriously. \n\nAs for the stability of the career field, it's growing in every country I've heard of and there is a global shortage. I know people are being laid off, but honestly I just recently changed jobs and did not have issues doing so. There are rumblings that the US intends to make cyber security a national focus, which will grow the field even more and possibly prompt other countries to follow suit.",
      "> I've been seeing alot of youtube videos of layoffs in the tech field, and how hard it is for these people with years of experience to find a job.\n\nYour concern isn't about any specific field of but rather the exploitation of labor which capitalism demands.\n\nThe truth is that every single person with IT skills on the planet could be put to work today and there still would not be enough skilled workers to meet the actual demand for IT labor in the current market.\n\n> im about to hit my mid 30s and I don't want to invest all this time and money to later be unemployed and still in the kitchen\n\nThe difference between gaining IT skills and working physical labor is that if you treat your body well, in general if you don't develop some issue that hurts your mental faculties your mind will continue to function and even develop and thrive resulting in more skill thus more valued IT labor over time. This is not true for physical labor roles where your labor value tends to deteriorate over time.\n\n> I was watching an interview with one of the popular cybersec youtuber and even he was talking about how he personally know talented people who have been laid off and unemployed for months!\n\nThe problem with this is it is anecdotal. I'd question this data point along the lines of what niche roles these people hold, what actual employment opportunities they have attempted to seek and what market they are looking in. Cybersecurity is an incredibly vast field that is constantly developing and for which there are many, many open roles. I've personally seen very talented people be let go because they were unwilling to work within the business goals of a company.\n\nSomething you need to understand about publicly traded companies is that when \"the market\"/\"the street\" (Wall Street analysts) make a call about what they expect, and each company doesn't respond in kind, the value of the company stock is put at risk. For so many IT companies regarded as \"high growth\" the stock price directly reflects compensation rates for their highest paid employees due to the stock grants that are part of the employees' total compensation. So if Wall Street says they expect a company to justify their hiring over the last 8 quarters int he fact of the forecast of the next 4 quarters, depending on how aggressively they were hiring some companies may need to do a round of lay offs if they don't want their stock price to tank for the next 6-12 months. Here's the thing: just because the company is a \"tech company\" doesn't mean their layoffs are in their IT or engineering staff. For example, a tech company whose main revenue is around cyber security can't afford to let go of cyber security talent, because that's where their revenue comes from. However a company whose primary revenue comes from their CRM software business may be able to shed some of the roles within their security team without impacting their revenue.\n\nTalk to anyone who was mid-career during the 2008-2009 layoffs and ask them how long it took to start hiring back people they laid off. The similarities between the 2008-2009 and 2022-2023 labor downturns are uncanny for those of us who were there. The difference this time is that it was the tech sector rather than the financial sector who got hit the worst.\n\nThe point is that focussing on the current labor situation and social media personalities farming clicks isn't the best source for informing your own career. You should probably look in to the roles you are interested and get a better understanding of how they fit in to a business. This can help you understand which companies you should be seeking out, for example, highly regulated companies who sell services to the federal government or to medical or financial firms will have a huge requirement for meeting regulatory requirements mandated by law and when it comes to selling services to the federal government in particular these contracts tend to last a very long time, basically printing money *provided the firm can maintain their regulatory certification*. In these companies the cyber security domains of compliance and vulnerability management are critical for the business to maintain revenue. By contrast if you are a red-teamer/pen-tester at an e-commerce startup, if times get tough it's no skin off their back to let you go because they can always just rent the same skill set from a cyber security consulting firm (who will probably hire you for that contract after you're let go from the company).",
      "The amount of delusion people think of what it takes to get a cybersecurity job is truly amazing and I have to take my hat off to all these influencer ads that are being pushed to make it seem easy.\n\nNot only does it take grinding and learning multiple disciplines to become proficient in its also an extremely niche field so the amount of jobs will be even more competitive.\n\nMy advice would be to look into IT as a whole instead of a specific field. Work on your skillset and let your career take you where your true interest lie.",
      "Hey,\n\nUK Perspective here,\n\nSo I just landed a fully remote cyber sec analyst role, post about it is over here: (I detail my exp) [https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/15hjdb1/comment/juqluj3/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/15hjdb1/comment/juqluj3/)\n\nFor me to get noticed, I had to sacrifice a hell of a lot - I've loved every minute of the learning process and its fantastic that it's all finally paid off. The reason people want passion is because ultimately, this isn't a field where you can do 1 cert then walk through, especially for the more technical branched roles. You can go GRC/Auditing route which isn't technical, but... it's the least fun, but a foot in the door to then pivot.\n\nYou have to sacrifice a lot of evenings, time with friends, family to get to a level where you can sit at a desk and know exactly what you're looking at (or at least minimal training to get you up to speed). Theres a lot of competition right now from very talented indivuals who have worked in IT for a lot longer than I have who can't break in. I was carried completely by my passion for everything technological & my dedication to self-development - Which was all self funded & done during my lunchbreaks & evenings every day.\n\nIf you're only in it for the money, you won't go far in Cyber (if you get into at all) - Which there isn't anything wrong with, some people prefer to stay at the lower level jobs because less responsibility... Although in cyber you'll already have quite a high level of responsibility anyway.\n\nI'm all for people switching careers into IT, but if that spark ain't there; then guinely... I even wouldn't bother. For most people it's the helpdesk for a few years, which is already a painful process for a lot of people. Then over to network engineer/sysadmin role who then pivot with a small paycut over to Cyber because the higher level roles are more lucrative.\n\nBut hey if you're willing to spend time studying after work, grinding away & letting cyber be on the front of your mind most days whilst working the helpdesk, then Cyber is for you. As others have said, Cyber is just one small branch  of many on the tree that is Information Technology, don't fixate on this niche, who knows you might like Networking more.\n\nHope that helps!",
      "Geez, all these great advices and I've been wasting my time on YouTube! I'm going to be saving a lot of these comments  for me to read over again. Thank you to everyone!",
      "If there was a sure thing when it comes to a stable job we all would be going for it.  Its not the way to think about your future IMO because you are going to setup yourself for failure.

      "I'm still planning on getting into Security Engineering instead of Education (which I am currently in school for). Sadly it means a big pay cut because education pays a lot better than cybersec in my country, but it's more interesting.",
      "This showed on my suggested feed and since I'm in IT as well, here's my opinion.\n\nHaving cybersecurity as it's own field is disingenuous and damages the IT field and maybe even downgrades someone's real skill because they don't have some piece of paper that says they're good enough. They are one the same, where cybersecurity is an enhancement, or specialty that builds upon the foundation of IT.\n\nThink between nurses, doctors, and surgeons. They're all built upon the same field, same education, same degrees, but an enhancement of the previous.\n\nTidbit, we have a dedicated cybersecurity guy, cert and degrees, but he's worthless compared to our networking and systems guys that know the work, do the work, the full resposne stack. He's a glorified position that at best triages like a sudo manager.\n\nMy opinion, go for IT, but study and emphasize networking as the end goal. Get systems level experience in. Get it all. Then you'll be an effective cybersecurity.",
      "Hello all,\n\nSimilar question if someone is able to help :) \n\n  \nAs the title suggests I am keen on a career change into Cybersecurity and would like some advice on what roles I should begin applying for. \n\n  \nUp until recently I was working as Graduate Lawyer. I've had probably about 1.5yrs experience working in legal practice across a broad range of areas. Working in law I was faced with the realities of the profession and I realised I wasn't happy. In my experience, law is oversaturated with a poor ROI. No matter how hard one tries, personal and professional success isn't guaranteed. However, it's shown me how increasingly reliant we are on tech and sparked an interest/desire to up-skill in Cybersecurity. \n\n  \nIn saying that I hold the following:   \n1. Bachelor of Business (International Business) - also was awarded a Cert IV in International Trade and Dip in International Business during my first year  \n2. Bachelor of Laws  \n3. Graduate Diploma in Legal Practice; and   \n4. Security Clearance Neg Vetting 1\n\n  \nWork Experience was gained in diverse work environments and includes legal practice, the Army Reserves and luxury retail. \n\n  \nMy skillset is unique and easily transferable. Based on my experience I've got a strong customer service ethic, ability to learn fast, strong communication skills with an emphasis on translating tech info to non tech audiences, navigating high-pressure environments, managing competing deadlines and strong prioritisation skills - just to name a few. I am aware I lack the \"tech skills\", however,  I am enrolled in a Cert IV in Cybersecurity (100% Aus Government funded) to hone the technical and practical aspects.\n\n  \nMy question to the community is the following:  \n**1. What roles should I be applying for based on my experience?**   \n**2. If applying for an entry level position like a Service Desk Analyst, what steps should I be undertaking to go from that role to a role in Cybersecurity?**\n\n  \nAnyone who is in the same position, has done something similar, regardless of law or not, please share some advice as it would be appreciated! :)",

    "content": "Alright. \nThis is gonna be a long one so buckle up.\n\nI have seen countless post from people that fall into the following categories:\n\n1. I wanna get into IT but I have seen too many gloom and doom posts here and I am scared now.\n\n2. I want to get into IT but I wanna work remote, make over 100K, and be in cybersecurity.\n\n3. How do I get into IT? What do I need to do?\n\n4. Which degree should I get? Which certificate should I get?\n\nLet me start by saying I am not making fun of anyone or judging anyone. I am just hoping to help clear up some questions for people. \n\nIt has been said many times before but the wiki is the best place to go for all of your questions. You can find it here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/s/y0A6PVaYG8\n\nBesides that, here is all you really need to know about the above questions:\n\n1. Yes, the IT market is very saturated right now and very competitive. This does not mean that you are screwed if you are trying to get into IT. There are some places that are better for IT jobs than others and location plays a big part in it. \n\nThe market is also cyclical and it is unlikely that it will stay this way forever, but even if it does, if you work hard and push yourself you can make it happen.\n\nYou also need to take into account that lots of industries are suffering like this right now, not just IT, so making your decision solely based in that will not work out well.\n\n2. Roles this great do obviously exist, but they are NOT entry level roles. They are going to be senior level roles where the people filling them have 7-10+ years of IT experience already. \n\nDoes this mean you should give up? No. It just means you need to tailor your expectations. Get whatever entry level job you can get first (help desk, support tech) and work your way up and gain experience so you can make it to that dream job one day.\n\n3. The best advice I can give you for getting into IT is this:\n\nExperience > Certificates or Degree\n\nExperience is king and is what everyone is asking for. This is way just getting your foot in the door and getting a job is the most important. So you can start building experience. \n\nIf you cannot get that job then start home labbing. Set up equipment and mess with configurations and learn that way. If you cannot afford a home lab then there are free resources out there that can help you learn. For specifically networking, you could download Cisco Packet Tracer and build networks on that for practice. It lets you practice routing configurations and network architecture and all that great stuff. This is just one example, but there are other free resources like this out there depending on what side of IT you are looking to get into.\n\n4. This depends on the situation. If you get a degree, your best bet is almost always going to be getting a generic IT or CS degree. Speciality degrees (like cybersecurity) sound great but you want to focus on broad, foundational knowledge early in your career and then specialize later.\n\nSo if you want to get into cybersecurity you could get a general IT degree and then pursue cybersecurity certificates, for example.\n\nNow as far as certificates go, you almost always want to get your entry level certificates if you havent already gotten into IT. Think CompTIA A+, Network+, and Security+.\n\nIf you have a solid foundation already and want to start specializing, then there are other routes as well (like CCNA for Networking or Azure/AWS certificates for cloud or PenTest+ for security). There are many more options than what I am giving you here but you get the idea.\n\nIf you want to get into IT, then go for it. The only thing stopping you is you. Dont let the doom and gloom scare you.\n\nMisc. Things:\n\n1. AI will not replace you, AI will change the landscape of how IT works but we will still be here. Other jobs will be replaced sooner than IT will (think low skill, low mental capacity type jobs).\n\n2. Cybersecurity is very rarely an entry level role. More than likely, you will have to get a regular entry level IT job and study up, get certificates, and pivot into cybersecurity.\n\n3. I recommend looking at the material for Tech+ and ITF+ from CompTIA if you have zero IT experience. They are their most basic certificates for IT. If you struggle with that material, that is not a good sign (this doesnt mean you cant get into IT, it just means that it will be much harder for you and it will take you longer to grasp concepts and material as you learn).\n\n4. IT is an industry that requires consistent learning (some people get away without doing this, but if you want to remain competitive, then you will be constantly learning). This means studying for certificates, learning new systems, learning new concepts, and doing it in your own time sometimes.\n\nI say this to get across the fact that if you are not truly interested in IT, you will probably see this requirement as a burden and it will turn you off from a career in IT (do not let this one issue stop you, just be aware of it).\n\n\nAll of this is to say if you are truly wanting to get into IT then go for it and work hard for it. Start with general knowledge and do not worry about specializing until you actually start your IT career. You got this!\n\n\nEdit: we are going to agree on Experience > Degree or Certificate, rather than Experience > Certificate > Degree\n\n\nEdit: if you do not like talking to people or are not interested in customer service type roles, IT might not be a great choice. A lot of entry level roles (like help desk) and even senior roles (like sysadmin) require pretty significant interaction with users.\n\n\n\nTLDR;\nYou dont get one. Go read it.",
    "comments": [
      "Whenever IT is mentioned it's always one of these three fields:\n\n- Help/Service Desk\n\n- Service Tech/Field services\n\n- Networking\n\n- Cyber \n\nJust a friendly reminder to all that usually IT is accompanied by...**IS**. There's a lot of Information Systems positions that you may be very qualified for and don't know because you either you ignored that entire side of the field or are too scared of the more \"clerical\" work. From being a business analyst, QA tester, Asset/license manager.....a lot of jobs that are waiting for that person who has 10 years of office experience and can follow directions or whatnot. \n\nDon't short-change yourself....or wake up. Or maybe don't wake up and keep banging your head in your help desk job and not asking your company how you cna make that pivot to being a BA, as trust me, most just rely on Visio + Excel and those are things you too cna learn :)",
      "To add to this, if you're looking to get into IT and are serious about it, at the very least you should look into getting an Associates Degree in an IT major.\n\nExperience is definitely far more important, but nowadays a degree is almost always required, even for entry level jobs. There's so many people looking for IT jobs that it seems most HR departments have that as a hard requirement, so even people that have experience get filtered out for simply not having one. I'd say a degree is far more important than certifications, for the HR filter aspect alone.\n\nTo put it into perspective, I've had coworkers that have been working in IT longer than I've been alive, that have been stuck at the same entry level positions I was working simply because they didn't have a degree so they weren't technically qualified for anything better. I had the same job they had, and they had far more experience than I did, but I was the one that ended up getting promoted into a cybersecurity position over them because I had that piece of paper they lacked.",
      "You should add in all the \"I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE CAN I WORK OUT OF A CLOSET IN IT?!?\" posts. Work on your self confidence and get a therapist.",
      "Very informative and a great post as someone who is currently studying for their A+!",
      "While some people in various IT roles may be able to get away with the constant learning, this will not work when transitioning to Cybersecurity where pushing yourself to learn consistently is a MUST. Ive seen a lot struggle after moving to Cybersecurity or get burned out easily because they do not have the infrastructure knowledge.",
      "I would add BE OS AGNOSTIC to give yourself an edge over all the others who will only use one OS. Learn Linux, Windows, and Mac OS like the back of your hand and it will help you get in easier. It will also help you hold onto your job when the rest of the team refuses to support or touch the new computer your VP just bough themselves and you can step in and assist them. I have literally had that happen multiple times.\n\nCybersecurity is boring as all hell, it isn't hacking or at least it rarely is. It is writing policies and having meetings and telling petulant child like adults that yes they do have to use MFA and no they can't bypass security measures and yes you know it is inconvenient but they need to get over it.\n\nLastly work on your interview skills and your resume. The industry is saturated but so often when I dig deeper the people having issues getting a job are having trouble with their interviews and only make it to one interview before being tossed aside. You can have all the skills in the world but if you suck at interviews and your resume sucks you will get nowhere.\n\nAlso work on your people skills you need to get along and work well in a team setting. IT people who are assholes and can't work on a team don't last long or if they do it is very rare.\n\nThis post is great by the way. \n\nAlso if you get into IT and are in a generalist role and you want to specialize in networking for instance then do everything you can to shadow the network guy and ask questions and ask them if you can take care of smaller network issues or at least try to fix them before escalating to them. That is how I learned networking and firewalls. I started working on those tickets instead of escalating them and when I got stuck instead of having the network guy fix it for me I asked him questions and for guidance.",

You just respond to Alerts all day long, and you won't actually be the person remediating or doing any of the fun work.

      "Ill also add that while is certainly possible to move up in rank and pay very quickly, it is not the norm. Aside from having the basic skills and learning new ones quickly, you also need the right breaks. Or you need a mentor that will help you move up. \n\nIts easy to read IT career threads on Reddit and think it is common to hit six figures in 2-3 years but it is not, at least not in average COL areas. If you ask for feedback on anything, the first people to speak at each extreme. \n\nHow many women have to slept with? Youll hear primarily from playboys and virgins. How much weight can you lift? Youll hear primarily from strongmen and weaklings. How much do make? Youll hear primarily from people who moved up unusually fast or have been stuck in a rut for decades. \n\nThose people arent lying. Theyre telling you their personal experience. Many honestly cant grasp why were not all making $200k within the first five years of our IT career. But just remember most people are in the middle. Set your expectations and goals accordingly.",

Seriously though, other directions of focus can also specialized SaaS certs like ServiceNow, Salesforce, etc.  there isnt a glut of people with some of those certs and most of the study material is online.  Every industry out there has specialized software that needs admins and programmers.  Medical has EPIC, CRMs have Salesforce and its kin, there are dozens of ITSM systems, and what not.  The trick through all of this is to find the right bone you want to gnaw on.  Being a jack of all trades is good, finding a direction and chasing it is a good plan.  A good thing to remember, and I have a hard time myself, is only keep doing it while it is fun.  Riding it out and hoping it might get better is a fools game.  Oh, one last tidbit.

DO PROJECTS AND ADD THEM TO YOUR RESUME, THESE GREATLY HELP, after you have your foot set in and have a solid foothold of 1-3+ years then your work and experience can slowly start speaking for itself, but stuff like cybersecurity is also very late and not entry level, Im not shunning anyone pursuing it, but remember IT is a marathon not a sprint, it pays off the longer youre invested, at least thats what Ive seen, and dont hesitate to ask question, be a go getter, personally with my experience my bosses have loved when I asked a question I didnt know before I started potentially breaking stuff, a good boss wont have an issue with you trying to do your job correctly",
      "I learned computers back when they had monolithic core memories so I am not by any means tech savvy in 2024, but as I rose in management I wound up hiring a lot of IT people and managing multi-million IT projects.  The best IT people I have worked with are those that knew how to get their hands dirty.  If you have never picked up a soldering iron, never terminated a cable, never spent any time troubleshooting hardware, then you really don't understand how a computer works.\n\nThe world is full of non-functioning computers that people will give you or will sell you for $10.  Get a bunch and learn to fix them.  Build your own network in your basement.  Learn what does and does not work.  That won't get you a first job in IT, but it will make you a better employee when it happens.  Ultimately most IT comes down to self-learning, so grab a box and get to it.",
      "Great post, OP! For anyone feeling discouraged, I am 33 and broke in at 30 with no degree or experience - I spent the previous 10 years in the service industry. \n\nI needed out of the service industry and knew I wanted to work in IT; I had for years and was selling myself short. I was a bit daunted by some of the A+ material so, like OP said, I did study and pass the CompTIA ITF+. Immediately after, a buddy got me a referral and interview for Service Technian I. I'm in my 2nd role now as a Deployment Specialist and I'm currently applying to a third role. \n\nAs for A+, the material is super easy for me to understand now that I have working experience to relate to. I'm currently preparing for my core 1 exam. \n\nWhile I did get lucky having a friend help me get an interview, the studying and preparation I did was absolutely crucial for me to land the role.\n\nHang in there y'all! Study and be prepared for technical questions in your interviews.",
      "This made my day sir! I will not give up. I'm working on my resume and studying for Sec+ and A+. I'm more than determined to get into this field. Big learning curve but I am enjoying it. Thank you a million for keeping the fire in me and others trying alive with this GREAT post!",
      "Im looking for advice on a decision Im trying to make. My job is covering the cost of a full bachelors degree, which is a fantastic opportunity, but Im torn between going for an IT degree or a Computer Science degree.\n\nI already have an associates degree in computer networking and a general certification in cybersecurity, which means Im about halfway through the IT degree. If I push myself, I could finish it in about a year. On the other hand, a Computer Science degree would take me closer to three years to complete, but everyone keeps telling me its better. The problem is, when I ask why, I usually get vague answers that dont help much.\n\nFor context, I really enjoy IT and helping peopleIve been working in remote help desk support for about two years. That said, Id also like to move into cybersecurity and don't know if the quicker IT degree is the best option.\n\nThanks in advance for your time!",

      "Best bet? IT sales. The key here is NOT understanding to a granular (i.e. source code) level of the solution. It is being able to articulate the business/user benefit of your offering(s). Especially if selling enterprise software, database, data management, SaaS, etc. So, is $100k (and the WFH aspect) attainable? Umm, yeah, all that means is you're still learning the ropes. Most of the established, legit players offer top tier candidates a 50/50 comp plan, which means 50% is base salary and the other 50% is commissions based on achieving your sales target. A couple of things to consider. Most top-tier candidates enjoy a $150,000 base salary with an overall compensation target of $300,000. Anything you sell after that has a multiplier which really bumps up your earnings. However the real key and the way that you know you are kicking it is that you never look for a job, as your achievements become known. They recruit you. I told one of the top three software companies (MSFT/Google /Oracle) recruiters that no, I wasn't interested three times until I finally agreed to an interview. Had my own personal grand slam with them 18 months later (7 figure earnings that year). I always took the mile-wide, inch-deep approach to knowledge because I always had enough backup internally to help deal with more complex issues. Assumptions are that you have excellent communication skills, understand how to leverage technology into quantifiable business benefits, and a \"take no prisoners\" approach regarding your competitors.",

      ">the wiki is the best place to go\n\nUhm, not necessarily *best*, but pretty darn good, and highly relevant for the context (notably being right here on Reddit)\n\n>2. Roles this great do obviously exist, but they are NOT entry level roles. They are going to be senior level roles where the people filling them have 7-10+ years of IT experience already.\n\nUhm, barrier for entry isn't *quite* that high.  E.g. fresh grad with highly relevant degree and from one of the top universities and towards (e.g. upper 1/3 or (much) better) of class at B.S level, or about top half and up at graduate level ... those relatively few folks may well start off at >=100K - but keep in mind, that schooling is effectively 4+ years of pretty solid often rather to highly relevant experience - and may also include internships, etc.  But that's way above the level of probably >99% of the folks here that are wanting to get into IT or land that first IT job.  Heck, in *some* ways even still above my level and I've been in IT 40+ years and have a pretty solid college background too.  So yeah, the vast majority won't be jumping straight into 100K+ ... and many will never get there either.  It's not about years - though that can quite help.  Some don't rise to the challenge.  Some will be in IT 5+ years and not know a dang thing beyond they day they started - which wasn't much at that and quite minimal.  Others, only 3+ years and they'll be flying past those with 7+ years like they were standing still (but that's exceedingly rare exception - like probably less than one in a thousand - but they do exist, and I've seen a few).\n\n>Experience > Certificates or Degree\n\n>Experience\n\nRelevant knowledge and dang well knowing how to apply it is highly important.  Some/much of the time trumps experience ... but not necessarily so - that will vary a lot among employers and hiring managers, etc. - heck, even the HR, etc. gauntlet of filters one may have to first make it through.  And of course experience is also quite important and highly relevant.  And experience needn't be limited to *work* experience.  If you've done it, that counts - and can, e.g well put it on resume as experience/skill, etc.  But do be dang ready to well explain that experience or whatever if/when they ask about it if it's not from work experience.  Random example - I've been doing lots more with IPv6 and DNSSEC for decades on my own for many public servers/services, compared to the relative pittance of such most employers have thus far had me do with such - and I can highly well cover such topics and manage them, etc. (not how I'd word it to prospective employer, but hopefully you get the point).\n\n>If you cannot get that job then start home labbing\n\nDon't forget volunteering.  Do/solve stuff for other folks (but not their homework problems), participate in relevant forums, figure out the answers/solutions to solve stuff or implement the needed.  Often lots more interesting/challenging stuff from \"real world\" scenarios than anything you might think to slap together in your \"home lab\".\n\n>If you get a degree, your best bet is almost always going to be getting a generic IT or CS\n\nDoes depend a whole lot upon the institution and degree program.  Some specialization/focus *can* be a good thing.  But don't box yourself in *too* much ... especially if you actually want to get a paid job in some reasonable amount of time.  Some degree programs also allow for much flexibility, all under/within the exact same degree - e.g. picking a specialization or emphasis ... or even picking and choosing specific classes as one wishes - so long as they satisfy the requirements of the degree - so carefully evaluate and choose wisely.  Anyway, too broad *or* too focused/specialized can be (quite) sub-optimal.  E.g. B.S. in General Studies will generally be sub-optimal.  Likewise a B.S. with extreme specialization on something where there are 3 jobs on the planet in that specialization, and 100,000 well qualified folks that want one of those 3 jobs.  Optimal will be the right balance between those extremes.\n\n>cybersecurity\n\nOft said, but to reemphasize, oversaturated, especially lower/entry levels - not impossible, but much more challenging to land jobs there.  Most opportunities open up at solid relevant graduate+ level degrees.\n\n>as far as certificates go\n\nAs I oft (approximately) say: Certs schmerts!  ;-)  Knowledge, etc., generally much more important.  And also, some certs are helluva lot more useful/practical/worthwhile/valuable than others (some are a ripoff and (near) total waste).  That being said, certs can be useful where resume/experience etc. doesn't otherwise show the knowledge/skills and one doesn't have the experience, etc., and/or for some (especially lower/entry) positions where many openings for many employers may use or require certain cert(s) as a gatekeeping filter.  So certs *can* be a useful way, but certainly not the *only* way.  And for some/many, if you find certs are an excellent way you well learn the stuff - hey, sure, go for it!  But for some folks and/or certs, they may not be more than short-term memory exercises.\n\n>going to agree on Experience > Degree or Certificate, rather than Experience > Certificate > Degree\n\nContext matters - a *lot*.  Degree \"vs.\" experience - often depends a whole lot on the employer, but the majority of time it's the knowledge and experience that matter most, and degree behind that - but for some, degree or even certain type of degree may be a requirement.  As far as degree(s) vs. cert(s), rule of thumb - degrees are for the longer term and will generally serve one quite to highly well in that regard.  Certs are mostly for the shorter term and are mostly more advantageous more towards lower/entry levels.  But there are also various exceptions to these generalities.",

    "content": "* **IT isnt all that sexy of a career**.  A lot of non-techie people don't understand and/or care how IT works. Either their computer device works or it doesn't. Anything else feels like a science class. They don't care about the how, why, or what. So, it's not the best conversation starter. Youll also meet people who stigmatize IT professionals as the stereotypical computer geeks.\n* **On-call rotations are a fallacy.** For the most part, you are always on-call. Are you the most/only knowledgeable person on the subject? Call. Are you the only one available? Call. Are you the most dependable? Call. The person that is on-call is working on the issue but cant figure it out? Call.\n* **Sometimes you have to job hop for skills/experience.** You hear a lot about job hopping for more money but not much about hopping for more experience. Not every company is using all the cutting-edge tech and doing all the trendy IT tasks. You may find yourself at a company that youve outgrown from a skill/experience stand point because they aren't moving fast enough into the current tech trends. A lot of companies dont need or want to adopt. Maybe you want to work on large enterprise networks but your company only manages a small campus. Even if youre getting good money you'll have to decide if you should jump ship or stay stagnated skill-wise. To clarify, there really is no wrong decision in that situation.\n* **The path to maximizing salary and work-life balance are often different**. When I say work-life balance, I dont mean \"yay i work 40 hours a week and not 60\". I mean jobs where you maybe work a few hours a day, make a good wage, have good benefits, and have optimal time off/flexibility. Low stress jobs. Im not saying you cant have both but for the average person, those top tier salaries come at a price. Early on, most of us prioritize the money but when you get a satisfactory wage you start focusing on other benefits. There isnt any wrong path as long as you're comfortable with it. I'll be honest: This one is more subjective because there's so much to consider.\n* **\"Always learning\"gets old as you get older.** Youre always learning in IT for the length of your career. It's part of what makes it interesting, but it's draining consistently having to learn a new way to do what you've been doing for years just to stay relevant. So I can understand why some people eventually become reluctant to change.\n\nedit: \n\nHonorable mentions\n\n* Tbh, Your co workers do not want to train or mentor you.\n* Some systems are meant to be sub-optimal. \n* Burn out is common and inevitable without the right boundaries. \n* strong-soft /weak-tech skills > weak-soft/strong-tech skills\n\n\n\nWhat are you hard truths you dont think we see enough of?",

        "Mine is that Cybersecurity is not an entry level field. I wish more people knew that and weren't misled by colleges/universities, bootcamps and \"tech\" influencers. Yes, there is a skill shortage of cybersecurity talent, but it's at the upper-mid and senior levels. You need to put in the work to understand the basics and have an in-depth understanding of at least a few specialized areas in order to break into security in most cases. Sure, there are internship opportunities that have you looking through logs or doing \"entry-level\" type security work, but they are far from the norm and have gotten even more rare post-Great Recession.\n\nAnother one, networking and soft skills are more important than knowledge and hard skills. It used to be that you could get an IT job behind the scenes and specialize in a technical area far enough away from endusers. Not anymore. If you are abrasive and have no social skills, few will want to work with you or hire you.",

        "IT isn't that sexy a career, but the reason it's attractive is the chance to advance or make decent money somewhat easier than in other non-trade fields. I spent seven years working for Ricoh (an MSP) and after that amount of time, earned only $38K and my managers had no intention of ever promoting me to a position where I could make more. I have Facilities and manager experience, but it didn't matter.\n\nSo that's when I made the transistion to IT Support. After only 2 1/2 years, not only have I more than doubled my salary, but I've made more valuable networking contacts in all my years at Ricoh, and things I've learned in IT will hopefully help me down the road. Also working as an IT tech, I get treated somewhat better than I was at my previous job when I just did Shipping & Receiving, or Copy Center tech. I took a huge chance going for my first IT job, as it was just a six month contract. But with a lot of luck, it paid off.\n\nSo maybe this is a hard truth about an IT career: you have to put in the work to get in/advance, but you also have to jump at opportunities when they come up, and that a little luck is involved. There isn't a magic bullet to a good career, and things can change in the blink of an eye. I'm very aware that a downturn in the economy can cost me my job.

Worked in FAANG to the federal government to the one of the largest retailers in the world to healthcare. Most of what you say is true. It was a lucrative career until about 20 years ago and my wages started flattening out. I could only get pay increases by job hopping. Decades ago finding a job was a cake walk to the stupid hoops we need to jump through now. It\u2019s all much more cutthroat now. The other big thing is the constant technology changes. I don\u2019t necessarily mind them but if you make one mistake and don\u2019t stay active in the hottest latest cool tech you get tossed by the wayside and it can set you back years. Remember when companies used to hire the person and not all the cool technology you just learned? They used to give you training to get up to speed if you were a new employee. Not so much anymore. I\u2019ll be glad to retire real soon and get out of the treadmill career.",
        "I disagree with a few of your points overall\n\n**\"IT isnt all that sexy of a career**\"\n\nI think it depends who you're talking to for their perception of this. Millennials and Gen Z especially in urban areas will think being a software engineer at a well known company like FAANG or adjacent is pretty sick and you'll get a bunch of questions about it. In a rural area where most people are doing trades - you're going to be seen as a geek for sure.\n\nOlder generations won't really care unless they're also in industry.\n\n  \n**\"On-call rotations are a fallacy**\"\n\n100% depends on your role and company. Many roles don't have on-call at all. Also if you set clear boundaries that clears up most issues people have with on-call. So if you aren't scheduled for on-call a certain weekend - don't pick up your phone. \n\n**\"The path to maximizing salary and work-life balance are often different**.\"\n\nSometimes that's true but not always. I worked at a company known for bad WLB and it was rough - moved to my new company for a 50% raise and it's much better for WLB. Also - moving up in the company sometimes leads to less work to do but more responsibility - that can be viewed as less stress because there's less busy work. But it can also be viewed as more stress because of the responsibility. Comes down to individual perception of what you want to do I think.",

        "Anecdotally: The rotating on call at my org functions just fine, in fact: It's the most coveted of all the rotating shifts. We do 24/5 with rotating on call weekends. Each member of the team rotates out with the on call phone.\n\nFor every 4 hours of standby we get 1 hour of flat pay. For each call back it's 3 hours minimum at double time, plus double time for each hour you have to stay after the three hours. And we go in for about an hour each day (sat and sun) to make sure nothing is on fire and there's no weekend Warriors who need assistance and for that we get 4 hours flat plus double time for each hour longer.\n\nSo if you get the phone on Friday evening, do your daily checks and turn it off Sunday night (when the midnight guy gets in) you get around 24-25 extra hours for the month. More so if shit breaks.\n\nThe most I ever got in the 7 years I was there was about 60 extra hours for the month.\n\nSuper sweet gig if you ask me.",

    "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nTLDR: I enjoy coding; previous job moved away to everything except coding; quit my job; now I have no clue what to look for since I am really afraid of a boring job.\n\nI'm in my early 30s, based in Switzerland, and I have a Master's in CS. I've worked at a European company for 8-9 years (200 employees in CH), where I was the only in-house developer (but few other devs in eastern Europe). \n\nEarlier this year I had the gut feeling that I need to change something and step out of my comfort zone and thus quit my job.\n\nFor the company I developed a comprehensive software system (UI, Backend, DB, distributed web services) that has become essential for the company's operations and is now being rolled out for other countries as well since for CH it was a huge success.\n\n**Why I Left My Job:**\n\n1. **Overwhelming Responsibilities:** The software's growth meant I was handling analysis, integrations, 1st-3rd level support, rollout planning, devops, testing, and internal development planning almost entirely on my own (since 2 years I had another good developer from eastern Europe, but - altough test coverage was quite high - always had to check every single change since the complexity of the software was enormous and he was not that clear about out business logic).\n2. **Passion for Coding:** I love deep, complex development work and the hyper focus, but now that we went live with the software, in the last 2-3 years my role shifted towards management and support, which I didn't enjoy (in the past few months maybe 20% of my time was coding). In the first 5-6 years it was mostly coding since it was more like a proof of concept kind of thing with some quite challenging algorithms.\n3. **Additional Tasks:** Besides the main software, I developed and supported other smaller tools, acted as a product owner & tester for several other tools, and handled data extracts for f.e. AI projects. I also managed devops and DBA tasks for other tools.\n\n\n\nAfter resigning, my manager suggested I take on an analyst/PM role, leveraging my strength in understanding the business and thinking ahead.  However, I prefer coding and tackling complex development challenges.\n\n\n\nSo now that I am now traveling for 2-3 months already, I am starting to become ready for the next challenge, but I have trouble on finding out what it could be**.** What I'm looking for is:\n\n* I want to stay in IT and continue coding, focusing on complex and challenging projects (at first I considered to completely leave IT and start from scratch, but I know that would not end well)\n* I'm concerned that a typical coding job might be too routine and not challenging enough, so probably I should look for a smaller company and not for some bigger company (tbh to some extend I liked the chaos of my previous job)\n* Self-employment is an option, but it might involve handling support and devops independently (my old employer could provide projects).\n* Returning to my previous employer either as a developer (but I risk ending up in the same situation) or alternatively, I could focus on business analysis, but that wouldnt satisfy my passion for coding (and also really looking into a new challenge and leaving the comfort zone) - only reason that speaks for this is the comprehensive knowledge I have about everything in this company.\n* Im considering a shift to AI, though my experience is limited (altough my master thesis was related and I was the PO of some AI projects). Also ETH Zurich offers courses that could help me get started. I have a feeling that this could be interesting and challenging, but not sure if I see myself there.\n* Another option is pursuing a PhD, but I worry it might become monotonous to focus on a single topic for that long (but I think CH offers some quite nice positions).\n\nAny advice on potential career paths or opportunities that align with my interests and skills would be greatly appreciated! Recommendations for literature or podcasts are also welcome.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!  \n\n\nNB: formatted and summarized it a bit with ChatGPT",

You often have to get comfortable with at least reading and having a basic understand of application code and you'll often find it's much easier to use your cloud SDK to do automation. \n\nI absolutely recommend it though, the ceiling is very high here and once you get into things like architecting you'll quickly expand your skillset.",
      "If you dont please share the contact info for the job, lol.",
      "Ex-IT guy, now Cloud Engineer here, yes.",
      "IT Guy to IT Guy youre family wont notice the difference.

      "I was of cloud in my old role, so I am a bit biased. The biggest issue we had was people not wanting to learn programming. Though there were intellectual capable, it was more of a political resistance.\n\nEverything we did was infrastructure as code using ARM templates or Terraform.  Though click-ops might be OK for learning and tutorials, large companies want all the infrastructure to be code.\n\nThere was a strong cybersecurity aspect to the role which those coming from infrastructure ops did better at than those coming from software dev.  Many devs don't know not to open port 3389.  Most ops people understand not to  do that.\n\nGood luck in your decision",
      "I was a bit more than \"the IT guy\" but it felt my career  was at a dead end (specially considering I didn't want to become a manager of any kind).\n\nThen the opportunity arose to do the change and it has been a real blast. \n\nBe careful though, all the tedious bits of the job won't go away and may even get worse, but I have found the change very interesting this far (4 years now, time flies!).",

      "When I moved on to cloud engineer I did all those things but also touched Azure.

      "I left my role as a Senior SysAd for a job with similar pay where I became the lead engineer over a 6 man team. Normally wouldnt have done that for about the same pay (100ish / year), but it was focused on migrating their on prem data center to AWS GovCloud and I wanted the experience. That was 3 years ago, I just joined Amazon for almost triple the pay so I would say it was a pretty good choice at the time. \n\nTLDR: do it, you wont regret the experience",

      "Unpopular opinion but I miss the simple days working with on prem hardware, although the money situation is much better now (could have improved as well probably in the old position, you never know)\n\nThere is also more stress, more responsabilty in a cloud environment, and most likely Agile methodology which I hate so much coming as an old school system engineer at heart.\n\nAnd also depends very much what Cloud provider you will be working with.",
      "do you like scripting? then yes.",
      "It's a great opportunity. I'm freelance. I own my company providing tech support. I really enjoy working with users and resolving IT issues. My advice is always go for new challenges, you can face different and new requests that grant you experience.",
      "Hell yeah it's a good decision!  \n  \nWith everyone moving to the cloud, it's so much more of a higher demand, higher pay, etc.   \nI would also expect more opportunities for remote work as well...since it's you know...the cloud. \n\nJust a piece of advice, don't put all your eggs in one basket. Having a good skillset on multiple platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP, Alibaba) will set you apart from a significant number of other applicants. \n\nGood luck!",

I kinda miss the hands-on aspect of on-prem IT, although my back doesn't miss lifting the hardware :)\n\n(This doesn't apply if you actually work at the cloud hosting provider, but that's kind of a specialized position nowadays)\n\nYou're still going to be dealing with the usual stuff like building, retiring, upgrading, and maintaining virtual servers. You're still going to have to make and restore backups, and do user support.\n\nYou're also not going to get rid of that one moron who can't figure out how to reset their own password... you'll just get a new moron to replace them :)",
      "It's more work, and you'll likely find yourself overwhelmed sometimes, but the whole idea of IT is to experience that in your career and get better and more comfortable with new things. \n\nTake it, and if it's not more money know that it opens up SO MANY opportunities for more money later. And if the company culture sucks, know IT skills are transferrable, and you can go elsewhere. \n\nAnd if you absolutely hate cloud, you can drop back to being an \"IT guy\" with cloud experience and find your niche in time, but you need to experience and learn new things to know what that niche is.",
      "Yes, that's what I did",

I would say go for it and learn as much as you can."

    "title": "Demoted from sysadmin to helpdesk due to health problems/burnout, and just had a job offer rescinded due to poor references. Should I just change careers at this point?",
    "content": "What should I do in a situation where, due to an unfortunate combination of events, I have no references but 10 years of work experience?\n\nIve only worked at two places. I worked at Job #1 from 2012 to 2018 where I progressed from desktop support to Jr Sysadmin, and was a sysadmin at Job #2 from 2018 to June of this year. I got along well with Frank, one of the higher ups at Job #1. When I applied for my most recent job (Job #2), I used Frank as a reference, and a couple of coworkers, since 3 references in total were required.\n\nAccording to my new supervisor at Job #2, Frank gave such a strong reference that he didnt even bother calling the others on my list.\n\nAt Job #2, things were fine for the first couple of years. But in 2021, I underwent a complicated series of medical procedures, and I needed to use all of my allotted FMLA and most of my PTO. On top of that, my mother was diagnosed with dementia, and I was working on my bachelors in business during evenings and weekends. I had a grant to attend college tuition-free, but I had to have continuous enrollment to qualify. I checked with administration to see if I could take medical leave, but they told me if I did I would have to start paying. \n\nThis led to me burning out and receiving a poor performance review and a demotion (with the same pay and title) due to decreased work ethic and lack of attendance. For context, from 2021 to 2022, I had 4 inpatient surgeries, 2 ER trips, and dozens of physical therapy appointments and post op appointments in a 12 month period.\n\nHowever, the supervisor for Job #2 initiated an offer to give me a good reference if I decided to move on to another employer due to the demotion. \n\nLast week, I was offered a new job contingent on a reference check. One of the references was required to be a supervisor from the past 5 years, meaning I was forced to use the Job #2 supervisor as a reference. I messaged my supervisor asking if he would give a reference, to which he said he would be happy to give a good reference, although HR would prefer I only confirm your title and the start date of your employment. \n\nI next tried to get in touch with Frank, the really good reference from Job #1, via phone and email to ask his permission to use him as a reference again. No response to either request. With Frank out of the picture, and also unable to establish contact with a couple of other potential references from Job #1, I was forced to use a coworker from Job #2. He also reassured me he would give a good reference.\n\nLast week, I found out the offer for the new job was rescinded since my references said that I had a poor work ethic and attendance record. As stated earlier, I had major medical problems in 2021-22, making it difficult for me to give my all at work while dealing with severe complications requiring emergency care, scheduling follow up surgeries, and all of the associated stress of being a medical patient with unresolved physical problems for an indefinite period of time. And both of these individuals told me they would give good references, with my supervisor initiating the offer to start with.\n\nAt this point I feel like I need to go into another career field entirely because I have no references who will speak positively about my work. And in 10 years of working, I have only had one poor performance review, the most recent one, due to me being out on medical leave.\n\nWhat do I do next?",
    "comments": [

      "my first question is.. do you like doing the work if there was no burn out and stress? Do you like the work?\n\nIf the answer is yes then you need to understand why the stress is getting to you to cause the burnout. For me it was having a hobby outside of tech completely. No video games or anything that needed electricity. I helped start a dog rescue that saved my life. \n\nI learned to do my 40hr a week and not care.. if shit breaks then we fix it. If they don't want to pay for the right DR? then they learn a lesson. I've learned to not care what could happen and just live in the present at work.",

Also, if it was a colleague, rather than supervisor that screwed you with a poor reference, what do your internal HR policies/Staff handbook say? Have they violated any internal rules? Can you take action there, given you were advised you'd get a good company reference and did not?\n\nIn terms of a way forward, you definitely need to move employer, they seem toxic.

      "The problem for employers and the good thing for us greybeards, is there are far fewer young people coming up today that have the kind of experiences we did that made us curious, imaginative, and improvisational enough to work through problems and learn new skills.\n\nSure, some youngsters had cool parents who kept them away from tablets and smartphones as much as they could, but even those kids never had to struggle through configuring IRQ channels  with the DOS prompt in order to get Doom or Duke Nukem working with your sound blaster card instead of the shitty default PC speaker. Stuff just works at a basic level nowadays much easier than it did last century, and so many young people can't troubleshoot worth a damn if it doesn't, especially if the fix involves reading comprehension beyond a sentence or two, or god forbid having to type stuff in by hand on a command line.\n\nGrowing up during the analog to digital transition gave us a unique skillset that cannot be duplicated today. I'm older but not old enough to have experience writing in COBOL; those guys are all in their 50s and 60s or older and command ludicrously high salaries because the world's financial institutions still run on all those old A/S 400s and similar machines, and unless you cut your teeth learning that stuff way back in the day you have very little chance of being able to do what they can do because it's such an arcane and antiquated language despite how important it has become.",

I started consulting almost 6 years ago now (at 45). I love the fact that I am not pigeon holed into a role and I get to work on different projects and roles within the projects. Sometimes I'm the Infra design architect, sometimes it's finding people's DNS & AD issues, implementing a new solution or on-prem migrations into AWS and so on.\n\nYou'll need to be strong in fundamentals like AD, Windows (or linux, preferably RHEL), vmware/Xen. To buy you another 5 years, I would recommend getting either Azure professional cert or the AWS Architect - Associate cert. Just one of those on top of experience will land you a salaried consultant gig (occasionally, very cool projects for DoD, DARPA, AMC theatres, US patent and trade office, CA high-speed rail, Department of Corrections are some examples I've had the opportunity to work on)\nSometimes, like my most current I'm about to start, is not flashy. I'm going to setup an on-prem RHEL satellite patch server, automated monthly non-prd patching and create a quarterly PRD schedule and implementation plan. Afterwards, Im staying available as needed for infrastructure support which I now do for three clients with managed services/professional services contracts.\n\nIts a good gig for aging IT admins because our age is looked at in a positive light of bringing experience by the clients.\n\nThat said, you still get burn out.

So, I tend to get asked questions they don't know the answers to (or, alas, can't manage or bother figure out), put on training sessions, develop training materials, documentation, etc.  And a lot of the time, can outperform many of the (much) younger / less experienced coworkers by 2:1 or more ... or at least on many tasks ... and can also often solve the tough problems/challenges/issues that they just plain can't.  That makes one a valuable employee ... not irreplaceable, but none the less, rather valuable.\n\nHealth?  Maybe ... but take good care of yourself and, at least generally mostly, prevent that from being an issue.  My dad's 90+ and still goin' strong, no real health issues to speak of (no medical issues) (and mom wouldn't be far behind if she'd taken better care of herself).  Heck, my dad even has fun tinkering with the programming of his hearing aid to better optimize it to suit his needs.  Meantime, I've got classmates from high school ... pretty sorry lookin' lot - whole lot of 'em way out of shape, all kinds of chronic medical conditions ... lot of 'em (way too many) already dead - and mostly preventable diseases/conditions and the like.",

      "Long answer: I continue to get paid well because all the new IT guys only know how to be point-and-click Windows admins.  I picked up a new client about a year ago.  One month in, I identified a point-and-click IT guy they were using to gather business analytics.  It was using Microsoft SQL Server (expensive) with SQL Reporting Services.  The hardware was insane--several TB of SSD storage, 256 GB RAM, and dual 8-core 3.2 GHz CPUs.  And the IT Bro who ran it cost them \\~$15k/mo.  There was a compiled .NET App that would launch via Scheduled Tasks--one per office the client owned...and then it would hammer the remote Sybase database at each office while basically making a copy of it into MSSQL while translating a few table names and field names along the way.  Every night at 8 PM their corporate office would basically lose internet access while a few hundreds gigs of data was downloaded.  At 7 AM it was usually done (but not always) and a new scheduled task would start (another horrid .NET app) that would \"compute\" the data and make it available through IIS so they could view the analytics as a dashboard.  If an office didn't complete in time or timed out during the night you'd have partial data or no data.  In the case of partial data you'd \"just have to know\" that something was off and the IT Bro would connect in and re-run the \"compute\" task...or the re-download-that-one-office task effectively taking out their internet again for an hour.\n\nI wrote a nice little NodeJS app over the course of a few days, put it into a docker container, and just launched it at each office.  The NodeJS app would pull \\*only\\* the necessary data out of the Sybase database, crunch it, and post the results up to a $30/mo VPS running an API backed by Postgres (free) and a dashboard written in Django (also free).  I showed them the solution and showed how it updated constantly throughout the day, and told them that if they switched they would stop having problems with internet at their corporate office.  And they could re-purpose that monster SQL server into something else.\n\nThe poor IT Bro was busy looking for a \"database throttling\" .NET library to try to fix the problem when they axed him.  I don't feel bad.  They had been paying him a handsome $15k/mo for almost 18 months and he sat on his thumbs.  In turn I got $5k/mo for my solution.  It expanded a few months ago  to handle other clients too.  I dropped the price even further.  The old client is happy.  The new clients are happy.  I'm making a decent living, and spending \\~$100/mo on a Kubernetes cluster running on a few Linux boxes.\n\nDuring the same time, I managed to cut that client's monthly VoIP spend from $13k/mo (for 12 offices) down to $600/mo for 24 offices.  Didn't even charge for that.  But that's what happens when you hire someone who only knows how to basically be a \"reseller\" for things they don't know...and point-and-click admins don't know much.\n\nMy main business (being an MSP) averages 20 calls per day with a total resolution average of 90 seconds.  We don't pay for ConnectWise, TeamViewer, or any other nonsense.  We have our own remote support tool, our own ticketing system, etc...  We manage about 8,000 Windows, Linux, and BSD machines across our client base.\n\nTotal business expenses: \\~$2,000. Most of that is for AV and a Kubernetes cluster for running our applications (tickets, chat, automation system, phone/voice traffic, etc...).\n\nShort answer:  Be competent, work hard, hire smart, refuse to pay someone else to do what you should be capable of doing internally, hate Microsoft with a passion, avoid closed-source software.",

But with a security clearance and a niche skill, I can probably double what I make, but have to live somewhere crappy and be at a crappy desk every day instead of working remotely.  Seriously, why do SCIFs have to have such terrible furniture, lighting and monitors?\n\nI have zero interest in learning the same thing high schools are pumping out at this point.  I work with people who have been told repeatedly to never put company information into ChatGPT and they keep doing it.  People who are two years into a 3 month project.  \n\nMost of the people I work with are showing up every day like it's their first day on the job, no ability to plan for a quarter much less a whole year for what needs to be completed and working backward from there.

    "content": "I find myself much more happy if I can program some app in c# or python. However my current position is SysAdmin. If I am ever going for a developer position, I would have to start as junior and the paygrade would decrease significantly. I'd like to ask if any of you went this route and whats your thoughts.\n\nSorry for typos, english is not my native language.",
    "comments": [
      "Look for a DevOps role",
      "I work in a small structure and I do both. I have been lead developer for 10+ years and 5 years ago our sysadmin left. I took the job with little to no experience because their was no one else with the skill and the will to do so (and I was a bit bored of the routine).\n\nRatio is roughly 75% dev / 25% sysadmin, no on call. As long as everything runs fine I do not need to answer to anyone and I'm responsible for my sysadmin schedule.\n\nHonestly I love both, but I think I'm a developer at heart.",
      "I did this, however the paygrade was a huge bump for me. I went from making 52k as a k12 sysadmin of 5 years to 80k as a Dotnet API developer, fully wfh with flexible schedule.\n\nThe sysadmin experience made getting into DevOps and CI very easy to do and that is a huge boon skillset wise.",
      "Went from SysAdmin to automation/ticketing admin to writing PowerShell scripts. All increasing in pay little by little. What seemed to help me was publishing code to GitHub for my personal projects, then adding that as a portfolio in my CV. Ask if they have looked at it near the end of the interview, if they didn't mention it. That way it sticks in their mind and hopefully you get a second interview.",
      "If your shop is windows based. PowerShell is really potent and you can program there to no end.\n\nYes scripts are scripts but if you start to make a library (or a module) it is nothing different than programming.\n\nIf Linux based, then bash, python, configuration Management and what not.\n\nScripting is somewhat seen not as programming but if the scale of it is not trivial then it is pretty much programming.",
      "I started at a smaller company with an IT department that at the end had 3 guys in it. Over time I evolved from being a pure SysAdmin _(and 1st to 3rd level support, that's how it is in small companies)_ into a programmer.\n\nI started off writing programs on my own to help with our sysadmin tasks. One day someone approached me and asked if I could perhaps also write a \"real\" program _(=something with an UI that other users than us IT guys would then use)_. The task was simple enough so that I agreed to give it a try and fulfilled the job. It turned out to be an incredible time safer for that department. Eventually the word spread through the company that there's an inhouse resource that's capable of programming, so requests came in more frequently until I basically became a full-time programmer.\n\nI was fortunate enough of being able to decline requests, as I was honest enough to state that I'm not (yet) qualified enough for the task at hand or that it would take me literally _years_ to do that alone.\n\nNowadays I'm a full-time programmer (by job definition) in a different company. My wage raised, but given my career path above, this is due to the fact that I hadn't to start off as a junior developer, as I had years of programming experience under my belt.",
      "I went the other route. I was a software engineer and switched to sysadmin. Might get some hate here but sysadmin is a really easy job compared to being a dev.",
      "I went from sysadmin/jack-of-all-trades to C# developer and thoroughly enjoying it. I moved from a small company to a large one. I managed to get a bump in pay despite joining as a junior (although that's more about being underpaid at the last place) and i have a LOT less stress. It helps that i now have a team that has my back instead of being the only person being able to do stuff.\n\nMy current employer found that my experience as a sysadmin comes in handy, knowing about the systems, networking and general 'how shit works' helps to find bugs in the code and helps when diagnosing issues.  \nMy advice for jumping into a developer role is get a few personal projects, something that interests you, and get some code up on Github. Show that you know good coding practices and DevOps. DevOps is a nice crossover from sysadmin to developer and it helps to know it in either role.\n\nOverall, do what you enjoy. If you think you'll enjoy yourself more in a development position then give it a shot. If it doesn't work out, you can always go back to sysadmin and lean on your experiences as a developer.",
      "I went from sysadmin/support role for 15+ years to a developer role. Instant pay rise for me (wasnt hard to earn more tbh) .\nWill give more detail/info later from a real keyboard.",
      "Maybe not full on developer, but I do kinda want to transition over to analytics/BI at some point. I like being neck deep in raw data and finding a way to get useful info out of it.",
      "Honest question, do you think you are a good developer? If so I can almost guarantee you wont take a pay cut",
      "> and the paygrade would decrease significantly\n\nunless you are some super star overworked sysadmin, the actual market may surprise you. Writing software TENDS to pay more than managing servers in many places.",
      "I did! Paygrade went down. It will probably surpass my old salary in a year or two. I think it was worth it because I was pretty fed up with doing everything from end user support to network/server admin stuff. Mostly the end user stuff that pushed me over the edge though.",
      "I went to school for software development, did a little development work, then sysadmin'd for 2 years, now I'm a developer again. One thing I'll say is those two years gave me AWESOME troubleshooting and debugging skills for coding. Someone also mentioned how it helps with devops, that's true too. It's made learning Docker for me a breeze.",
      "I've run from maint programmer/developer->dba->sysadmin(current position)Will soon be moving towards more cloud admin/devops. A couple years in I am going back to developer. At the very beginning of career if you'd of asked me I would of said I'd never become a sysadmin/dba.\n\nLong time ago(as consultant engineer) I had a comic taped in n my briefcase. It showed a picture of guy looking into mirror, 'John turned himself into his worst nightmare, a manager'.  Turns out I eventually did run a team, I can do it, but it is not what I like to do.\n\nAs other responses said , the culture/Co/people can make any of the jobs pleasant or unpleasant, to which I'll add that if you find yourself in an unpleasant position try to change/turn it around.   \n(Edit: perhaps you'd have fun developing something to solve a problem/help out in your current environment/area or something out of your area)",
      "I'm about to.",
      "Sysadmin looking at being a DBA. maybe...",
      "Most wouldn't consider it development, but I switched to a role just writing SQL all day. Night and day difference.\n\nWe script in random other languages sometimes, but it's primarily all done with SQL.",
      "I moved from a Linux SysAdmin position to DevOps within the same company and even landed a 10k salary increase while doing that.\n\nThe learning curve is pretty steep though, even for a Linux SysAdmin. You would have to learn about CI/CD, build automation, git, etc... Which you or may not have experienced before. I did have experience with Git prior, but never touched Jenkins or Terraform for example.\n\nWhile job searching, I did find many companies that were looking for a SysAdmin / DevOps hybrid which could work for you",
      "I've been developing an ulcer. Does that count?",
      "Guess if I get a head injury and drop a few IQ points I could be a Dev",
      "I went the other direction so I'm not sure how to do it backwards.",
      "Thats de-evolution lol",
      "I went from sysadmin to dev few years ago. Initially got reduced salary but after around 2 years my dev salary was greater than my highest admin one. However, even if my salary stayed lower forever, I would never go back to sysadmin. Dev usually means no on-call, no irritating end-users or managers, fully agile work etc. \n\nAs a sysadmin I was working 60+ hours per week, got calls 24h and had to deal with dumbest users. As dev I work 40 hours every week, always have days off during public holidays and have to deal only with my team and a scrum master. If you have an opportunity to move admin-dev, I highly recommend that.",
      "I recently went from SysAdmin/engineer to DevSecOps. As long as you have strong background in scripting (PowerShell counts, Azure is big right now) you can get at least devsec pretty easily. And more and more of those are offering relo/wfh options due to demand.",
      "i am thinking of going back to being a sysadmin. i am now a devops engineer. but i hate having to wait for it to sort stuff. and i miss being in control",
      "Just sacked off 10 years as a sysadmin and moving on to a role that supports more programme and dev stuff, with the chance to move on to full time dev in a few years. I'd say, find the right opportunity and go for it!",
      "Not strictly related, but have you had any luck integrating C# with Powershell? The only solution I have is janky (C# starts PS script, PS script outputs to text, C# reads text)",
      "i've done it - I was lucky in that the place I worked in had a great path to move up from \"support sysadmin\" to \"devops\". I eventually wound up in devops there and then moved on to another company where I was a full time dev. It's not easy, tho.",
      "Just a thought. The two key skills developers lack are 1) security and 2) performance.  If you can develop skills in those areas that will help.\n\nBasically though, you will take a pay cut.  However if you can demonstrate value you should be able to move up the ranks a little. Worth trying to pick a job where thats possible.",
      "In my career, I've bounced back and forth between sys admin, network engineer, storage engineer, and developer. \n\nI now own a small IT company, and we provide all of these services.\n\nBeing a developer gives you a deeper understanding of networking, storage, and systems.  \n\nGo be a developer!  Then you can do whatever you want.",
      "I did a bootcamp. It was money up front and took time. Now I couldnt be happier with my choice. My pay and benefits are better in my new job, but I was prepared to take a pay cut. I truly believe the bootcamp helped me get a job. Employers will want to see some proof that you are capable, and a bootcamp is a good place for that. I did data science, but there are lots of other paths to take for development. My recommendation would be to start as soon as you can because youll be wondering why you didnt do it sooner.",
      "Ive done both in my career. Now Im more focused on the dev side of things.  But I still retain some infrastructure duties.",
      "As a 30 year IT vet, Heres my 27 cents  It depends a little on the environment you intend to work in.  Assuming corporate, Id rank the jobs in terms of availability, security, and pay by the following types:  1. Information Security, 2. DevOps, 3. Developer, 4. System Engineer.  I would literally reverse this in terms of enjoyment though personally.  Though one spin Id place on the admin/engineer role would be if you are a network engineer (a real one), or any system engineer with lots of cloud experience.  Azure and AWS are a completely new kind of admin/engineering.  Both in assets as well as networking, licensing, etc.  I am a VP in the corporate world now, and Ive been trying to hire a good Network Engineer with Azure experience, for about 4 months, and so far I havent found one, unless they are shooting for the moon and wanting a huge salary and full remote work.  I am flexible, but apparently not flexible enough\n\nInformation Security jobs are everywhere, and they pay really well.  I had one InfoSec guy making around $60k per year with only about 2 years experience, leave us for a job making $90K.  I have system admins/engineers making that much with 10+ years experience, and the job is a lot more demanding than the InfoSec job.  But its also way more boring in InfoSec.\n\nDevOps jobs pay very well, but there are the least of them.  Our company for example, has about 10 in IT Services, 6 in Information Security, 30 in Development, and 3 in DevOps.\n\nNow if youre talking MSP or small-medium business consulting, being an admin/engineer is the most engaging and rewarding.  You meet a lot of people, constantly get new challenges and different environments to design/build/support, but it probably pays the least unless you own the business.",
      "My degree is in software development and I ended up a sysadmin. I really wanted to program business apps and work with databases and I ended up a sysadmin. Lol. \n\nFast forward 10 years and Im a very qualified sysadmin and like you Id have to take a significant pay reduction if tomorrow I decided to get a dev job. I do html, js, powershell, vba, and some python fairly regularly but otherwise I havent written anything proper in ages. C++ and c# used to be my jam, dunno if those are even used anymore because Im too worried about the next exchange or log4j vulnerability. \n\nIve had a similar desire to make the jump and here is my plan that I borrowed from an old coworker who successfully did this. Spend a year teaching yourself as much as possible, make some games, applications, whatever. Just spend your off hours getting back in the developer mindset and practicing. Publish the good ones. Then he went and got a few certs. Sure it costed a few bucks but those bucks prove you know something which is an unfortunate necessity some places and might be the only way to get in the door. Then he went and got a slightly higher paying job and just kind of faked it till he made it and continued moving up. He even spent a few years working for Bethesda which I thought was pretty cool.",
      "Me! Ive gone from sysadmin to IT Manager to lead developer. It is possible, but most recruiters will only put you forward if you have X amount of commercial experience. Ive been coding since I was 12 (22 yearseesh) and over the last 12 months in perpetration Ive been putting a portfolio together on GitHub. I managed to find a company that was investing in the right person and not strictly someone with 10 years commercial experience. My passion projects certainly helped. For context the first recruiter I spoke to refused to put me forward for any developer jobs, that was soul destroying, but I decided to have a plan A, B and C just in case. Plan A was software dev, B was DevOps and C was a more senior position. Ive done before such as sys admin. After a couple of weeks of applying on LinkedIn jobs I landed my dream job. It is possible.",
      "Tacking on to the other advice, some companies will have SRE's fill a role which could help you transition, where you get more interactions with developers, which could help you understand how good your technical skills are.",
      "My job is both system administration and development, although I find that I am increasingly pushed more towards system administration because the organization is just now embracing silos as they fall out of favor elsewhere. The pay for many junior developer positions is probably comparable to or higher than what I make."

I usually put in a 50+ hour week as I did maintenance,  reboots and upgrades from home.  Never had a server go offline and all web services were always online during business hours.  After years of doing this I got sick (not job related)  and they had to outsource IT.   Long story short a few months later I was let go.   The outsourced IT became a corporate nightmare.   Servers regularly going offline taking the entire company offline, no user support and my SQL Admin services which were high value were lost.  Their cost was double to triple my salary.

A year ago I automated half my job which made my job easier and was well praised for it. Well the review time came and it didnt make a single difference. Was only offered a 3% merit increase.  I guess I have my answer that a promotion is not on the table. So what did I do? I simply turned on my LinkedIn profile set to open to offers and the next day a recruiter company contacted me. 3 rounds of interviews in full on stealth mode from current employer and a month later I received my written offer letter with a 40% pay increase, fantastic benefits which includes unlimited PTO. The easiest way to let your employer know is to be professional about it. I thought about having fun with it but I didnt want to risk having no income for 2 weeks. \n\nThe posts in this community are awesome and while it was emotional for me when I announced that your continued posts help me break the news gently!\n\nEdit: I am transitioning to a system engineer role and looking forward to it!\n\nEdit 2: holy crap I was not expecting it to blow up like it did and I mean that in a good way.

So that's normal.\n\nMost companies hire at market rates, but often don't do much to keep up (some do, but not many). There's some industries outside of IT which are similar, where if you're not giving people 10-15% raises per year, they're falling behind market. I once worked for a geo-technical company where basically it was policy that some positions got a MINIMUM 20% raise for the first 5 years... simply because that's what market conditions dictated.",

Then pivoted to an AWS Solutions Architect for two years, now I'm going back to a corporate architect role.\n\n* My time at AWS taught me there is still a TON of people who have no fucking clue about the cloud AND/OR automation. I'd get 45min into a presentation to be hit with \"so this all runs on VMware right?\". I worked mostly with government agencies who are of course behind the times, but their whole team is working classic jobs I held in 2013 (VMware, AD, Dell Servers, no automation), with some modern stuff sprinkled in (mostly M365 and some SaaS security products). While I worked in public sector, I also worked with some privately owned and they're not much different.\n* My time building the cloud environment for a global manufacturing company until 2022 taught me there is a place for everyone at a mid-size or larger enterprise (10k+ employees). We had the following less than 2 years ago...\n   * Developers that focused on building their app (full stack, IaC, as you say)\n   * SREs that just focused on CI/CD and Kubernetes and helping smooth out deployment efforts\n   * My team of cloud engineers building and maintaining our AWS/Azure footprints hosting the above\n   * My team of cloud engineers and sysadmins maintaining our fully automated standard VM deployment process (AWS/Azure/VMware) for those COTS applications\n   * The non-scripting but still passionate infrastructure folks moved on to things like M365\n   * The team of yester-year sysadmins that still maintained our shrinking on-prem VMware footprint and would increasingly relegated to supporting the folks running our COTS applications (kind of a windows/linux admin helpdesk)\n* I would think the above would just be even more prevalent the larger the organization is, until you get to tech companies which are a whole different ballgame. I have no direct insights but I can imagine any of the large banks having all of my example above, plus probably all kinds of even deeper specialists based on non-cloud technologies.\n* I would say to be MARKETABLE, today, in a mid-level or higher role, you need to have some automation experience under your belt, OS knowledge is a foregone assumption, and you need to be jumping at opportunities to get meaningful hands-on experience with AWS or Azure.\n* Most development jobs expect people to understand the full stack now. There's not much \"Just do the front end\". So what you're likely seeing is really just start-up style developers where the organization doesn't have the concept of a \"private network to maintain\" just a bunch of devs building shit and hooking it together.

      "Is the traditional IT path being eroded and taken over by software engineering?\n\nSorta. Roles and responsibilities are changing as we move more, if not already,  into cloud space.  The days of physical servers are long dead, and on premises stacks like VMware are a dying breed of IT infrastructure.  As far as it is being taken over, I think that's a stretch considering systems administration and software engineering are completely different jobs, and they only share an ancestor of being in the same field of technology.  \n\nHas sysadmin really just become a synonym for a user endpoints and SaaS admin? \n\nNo, at this time, there will always be a need for an administration piece to whatever technology is given.  For example, just because airplanes can fly on autopilot doesn't mean we don't need pilots. I think the same principles will apply with SA's/SE's. For now.... \n\nHow do you transition from this type of sysadmin role to an infrastructure (DevOps?) role? Or is that the wrong growth path?\n\nYou will never stop learning in this field. In my 20 years of experience, the way things were done 20 years ago are completely different then how they were done 10 years ago, and the things done 10 years ago are completely different then how they're done today.  You develop with the trends of technology and never stop learning.  Taking a step into the understanding of system / application development is a great way to step into this next step onto your career field.

I've worn many hats since I started doing this stuff back in the 90s, and yeah.... people don't think of physical hardware when you say \"SysAdmin\".  In similar roles over different orgs, I started out racking and stacking servers and network infra. In the last 5 years or so I can't remember hte last time I 'touched' a server other than to decommision it after migrating to cloud.\n\nTo most folks Sys Admin means administering mostly established setups and technologies.  \"Infrastructure\" especially tends to be more about working hand in hand with developers to maintain a working and performant production environment, codepushes, infra as code, and devops, etc.\n\nMy advancement path now, and for any other IT people I hire into my teams down the raod, is basically Helpdesk/endpoint management >>> Cloud infrastructure administration >>> management.",
      "It's funny cuz I'm worrying about my future and asking myself if I should look for some other fields, but I'm already in my 30's.\n\nStarted like 2 years ago to get into IT, and got a nice internship as a DevOps, and now I'm a DevOps basically. BUT, at my job, we're not require to do codding.\n\nWe just set-up most of the back-end and lots of CI/CD. I manage a gitlab instance, argocd, a kubernetes cluster where we deploy our stuff, keycloak, vault and such. We're mostly doing YAML files for deployments, set up the projects in gitlab and do the whole CI/CD part.\n\nThen we have to manage some databases and just monitor the logs from time to time for errors, and put out the fires. But that's it. Ohh and sometimes we have some projects to make new instances or stuff work in some cloud.\n\nWhen I'm looking for other job posting, everyone requires codding experience in different languages and dev experience...I'm not that. I'm afraid that if I'm getting out of this job, I'll never be able to find anything else. I just don't know how to code and it never been my interest to do so either.

      "It will always be a hybrid model. And as always, knowing and learning additional/new technologies is helpful. I manage a team hosting apps on-prem and cloud. When the cloud bill comes in ($30k/month for just one app!), there are always asks, if we can not move back to on-prem). When the on-prem discussion starts, there are asks why we are still on prem with that environment.\n\nFrom my perspective, it is just important that the team understands both worlds and they are not biased. They understand the pros and cons and can decide when to use what.\n\nAnother aspect is, btw, that many shops do not offer an own on-prem cloud feeling for their end-users/customers. An developer or DevOps guy needs an API to spin up 10 VMs/Pods/whatever instantly.. and not raising an ticket/request a ticket and wait 2 weeks until a SysAdmin set something up.",
      "13 year infrastructure engineer here, started from the help desk and did every role in between. \n\nThe biggest industry change Ive noticed is the movement away from white glove service. Theres a big push to empower devs to be self sufficient and turn infra resources towards architecture/design/stability/improvement more than customer service. \n\nThe easiest ways Ive found to transition and learn new skills are to build on existing ones. Shell scripting is a must. You dont have to know a programming language, but learn how to work in yaml. Thats the basis for a lot of the infra automation tools. I have never met anyone really successful who didnt do some self-taught skills improvement outside of work that they could use to get ahead. Personally, I took Udemy courses for the things I kept encountering in interviews or at work. Even a basic knowledge can put you ahead of those that dont try.\n\nWhen you interview, be up front about what you dont know. Give the concepts and use cases behind them (you can research beforehand if the recruiter tells you specifics or based on the job posting). Then tell them something similar youve used to achieve the same goal. Focus on how fast you can learn new skills and that youre willing to take on whatever challenges arise.",

It's just that we've picked up a lot of the skills and learned a lot of the lessons that the software development side of the wall picked up 10-20 years ago. My team is a team that leverages git, ansible, python, and powershell primarily for managing infrastructure. We obviously have to do things like RDP into a Windows Server and add an AD Site Link from time to time, because we don't do that often enough to justify making that software-defined.

      "First rule, don't lose sleep over anything . At the end of the day its just a job. You should want to do a good job. if your intentions are good only worry about things that are within your control.\n\nSecond rule, as soon as you are the smartest person in the room, find a new room.\n\nThird rule, a successful career is not built on IT knowledge alone. Know your audience. Executives, managers, and coworkers should be communicated to completely differently. Build personal relationships with those people who have your best interests in mind and those who can offer you something in the form of knowledge or additional pay. The rest of the people are grifters and should not be stressed over.\n\nFourth rule, you are young and just starting a career which technology changes every few years. This gives you an advantage that most senior people don't have. While boomer senior engineer is taking long vacations and attending his daughters dance recitals, you are watching youtube videos or posting on forums. This part of your career is your 'growth time' where you can take it as far as you want to put in the effort. You can in one weekend learn more than most people will bother to learn in an entire year. Use it to your advantage. Be intellectually curious. Dive into things. You mentioned Azure, try using terraform to deploy a secure application with a website hosted on azure web app with an azure SQL back-end that is connecting to a datalake. After, use a datafactory to automatically ingest data into that database to drive your web app. If you don't know what any of this is, even better... because once you accomplish it, you will already be better than 99% of /r/sysadmin users at modern technology.\n\nFifth, get out now before it's too late.

    "title": "Got my first cybersecurity interview only 2.5 months into my career change",
    "content": "Background info on me: i am 23 years old, i went to college for a few semesters before dropping out, and worked in healthcare for 3.5 years, from 2020-2024 (i was a pharmacy technician, and then became a pediatric medical assistant). During this time i also was into web design, and i started freelancing on the side in my free time and making websites for friends, myself, and small businesses here and there (2021-2023). In December of 2023 i started an LLC for web design, and i had 2 overseas employees working for me on a contract basis, and i would serve as project manager. I expanded our services to include web hosting as well, and now we manage web hosting services for a handful of our clients.\n\nOk boom. In july of 2024, i saw a youtube video that was titled start your cybersecurity career in 7 days. While it did pique my initial interest snd curiosity, i was obviously skeptical because i had been hearing about how cybersecurity isnt entry level. That youtube video changed my life. After watchin that YouTube video, i go t the following certifications in a few days: qualys vulnerability management, detection, and response (VMDR), Qualys cybersecurity asset management (CSAM), and qualys vulnerability management scanning (VMS). From there i started getting into cybersecurity youtube, and started finding more free courses. I started the google cybersecurity professional certifcate program, and i loved it. It gave me hands on experience with linux, sql, and python, (3 things i had NEVER used or even seen before). I became obsessed. I started doing TONS of projects, labs, and activities that would help strengthen my skills and resume. Besides those 3 languages, the google course also gave me experience with tcpdump, wireshark, and google chronicle. While i was taking the google course i was also doing some free cybersecurity virtual experience programs on the forage. I completed the mastercard cybersecurity program, the datacom cybersecurity program, the PwC switzerland cybersecurity program, the commonwealth bank intro to cybersecurity program, and most recently the Telstra cybersecurity SOC program. From these i gained hands on skills in other things, like  splunk, cybersecurity engineering, SOC incident response, and more. While i was doing all of this, i was slowly creating and building up both my resume and portfolio, and adding cybersecurity recruiters on linkedin.\n\nAfter completing the google course (which took me exactly two months coincidentally; july 24- september 24th) i started applying to jobs. I was spamminggggg applications and sending messages to recruiters. I just started applying to jobs last friday (september 21st) and sent out probably 200 applications in total. Yesterday, i got my first invitation to an interview, and it was for a cybersecurity analyst position at a bank. I almost shed tears of happiness because of how happy i was that all of my hard work is paying off. Obviously i understand its only an interview, and i dont have the job yet, but still it was so rewarding to see that email, and feel as though my endless hard work for the past few months has been paying off. I am still going to apply for more jobs, and continue to further my education and skills.\n\nI am going to get my compTIA Security+ soon (now that i have the 30% discount voucher i received from the google cybersecurity course) and i also scheduled the free ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity exam for november 6th. I cant wait to keep adding onto my list of skills and certifications. Ive been obsessed with cybersecurity lately, and i hope to make this my new career. \n\nEdit: also, a few ppl have asked about my portfolio, so im going to link it here: [my cybersecurity journey](https://justingoncalves34.github.io/Cybersecurity_Journey/)\n\nEdit 2: didnt get the job ill keep studying though, completing courses, and adding projects and experience along my journey.

    "title": "Career Change to Cybersecurity: Need Advice on Roles and Certifications for a Product Manager Studying Security+",
    "content": "Hey everyone, I'm looking for some advice on breaking into the cybersecurity field. I recently got laid off from my job as a Product Manager at a tech company, and I'm now looking to transition into cybersecurity. A bit about me: I'm 24, have a degree in Computer Science, and I've just started studying for the CompTIA Security+ exam.\n\nI'm interested in areas like GRC, consulting, and I'm open to exploring different fields within cybersecurity, but I know I don't want to code all the time or be a Security Engineer. I don't know all the possible career paths in cybersecurity, so I'd love for people to mention other roles that might suit me!\n\nI'd appreciate advice on:\n\n1. Should I be studying for any other certifications aside from Security+ to help me get started?\n2. What are the best ways to find entry-level cybersecurity roles?\n3. Any tips or suggestions for someone with my background on where to focus in the cybersecurity world?\n\nThanks so much for any help or guidance!",
    "comments": [
      "For starters, finding an entry-level job in the GRC domain is hard. \n\ni would suggest you upskill yourself with GRC certifications and a pinch of technical certs as well. \n\ncerts you can start with ISC2-CC ( free exam)  , Azure-SC900 , iso 27001 LI , CCNA, NET+\n\niso 27001 LI cert might give you a chance to get an internship or associate-level job coupled with sec+ and other certs.\n\nCybersecurity is vast. you have to choose your domain be it GRC, pentest, SOC, vulnerability assessment, cloud security, network security, or data protection.  all these fields have their own set of certifications. so choose wisely according to your interest",
      "Get your CISSP. There are no entry-level CS roles - you'll need YEARS of verifiable Sys Admin, Network Engineer experience. \n\nCyber is a group of jobs that requires you to be a very hands-on, technical person. So, that's what you need to aim for. If you're looking at compliance and/or risk, CISSP.",
      "GRC typically isnt an entry level position but I think your CS degree gives you a leg up. If you get an entry level job doing IT risk assessments or even IT auditing, youll have a chance to break into GRC. You mention consulting - have you looked for entry level positions the Big 4 places at all? Ernst Young (EY), Price Waterhouse Cooper (PWC), Deloitte, etc. Might be a good place to start. Its not a forever place to stay but looks great on a resume and would give you a lot of experience.",
      "don't do it. There is no job you can get with just a cert. You will need years of hands on real world experience of managing an enterprise level network as a network or sys admin. security is a mid leave path once you already have IT experience, its not something you can just switch into without it."

    "title": "Rant from an experienced IT pro who passed Security+ 701 on his first try and hated every second of it",
    "content": "Background: Ive been an IT engineer for 19 years, first as a network/system engineer, then transitioning to cybersecurity to the point where thats been my primary role the past 5-ish years. None of my jobs ever required a certification, so I had none, but decided to get my Security+ for the sake of job hunting.\n\nAfter going through some practice materials, I decided my study goal would be to just fill in the gaps on things Id need to memorize: acronym definitions, the difference between MOU/MOA/MSA, etc. Things that Ive never needed to know in the real world, and certainly wouldnt need memorized, but whatever.\n\nI skimmed 2 books, taking notes along the way on those things I didnt know off the top of my head. First was an ebook of the Mike Chapple/David Seidl Study Guide, provided by my jobs ebook library. It was pretty awful, focusing on a lot of stuff that wasnt in the exam, and being plain wrong about others. (e.g. It defined perfect forward secrecy as what Tor uses to forward packets. [This is not a joke](https://imgur.com/a/37Wj8zo).) Finding that it left a lot of gaps yet to fill, my 2nd book was the official CompTIA Sec+ study guide.\n\nAfter doing a bunch of practice questions, I was feeling more confident, and it seemed that the ones I had trouble with were mostly because they were just poorly written (with some even having typos), but surely the actual test itself wouldnt be that bad, right?\n\nIt was worse than I imagined. There were so many questions where I was just baffled about what they were talking about. And not in the way of I dont understand this definition or concept, but rather in the way that the scenarios were so vague that all I could do was pick either the answer I think they wanted, or the least-bad answer. (One question even had a typo!) A lot of the questions were of the variety: a thing happened, and youve discovered this evidence. what should you look at next?, and its so vague that depending on the real-world context, multiple of the answers could be reasonable. I purchased a package that came with a free retake, and as I was going through, I thought to myself, if I fail, I have no idea what to even focus on, because the things that are giving me trouble are just bad questions.\n\nAnyway, I had no idea that Id get my score then and there at the end, so I was pleasantly surprised to be presented with a passing score of 805. I kinda wish theyd let me review the things I got wrong, but Id probably have an aneurism over them.\n\nTLDR: Security+ is a terrible exam, and neither the study materials nor exam itself are a substitute for real world experience. Id never base hiring someone on whether they did or didnt have the certification.",

      "It seem the general consensus is that SEC+ feels like your failing but passing kind of test.",
      "I thought the same thing about both A+ exams and the Network+ exam. There were many times where it felt like a test of my ability to make sense of poorly written English, and not a test over anything to do with technology.",
      "I hear you\n\nI came in on the CompTIA train, so I'm the polar opposite of your background. However, having taken over 20 CompTIA exams (many of them just updated versions), I think the main problem with CompTIA is they try too hard to force \"critical thinking\", and the end result is a pile of questions that have seasoned professionals scratching their head saying \"who cares if I ping first or run ipconfig /renew first....\"\n\nThe only multiple-choice exam I've ever taken that I think did it right was the LPIC-1, where questions were 10 words or less, and there was zero ambiguity about what the right answer was if you knew it; the difficulty wasn't in a facsimile of critical thinking, but rather in the sheer volume of information they required you to know\n\nClucking aside, congrats on the pass. If you haven't already, perhaps take a look at the CISSP. Even if you don't find the exam much better than Security+, the pay bump and accolades it brings more than make up for it",

They have a step by step process for the concept presented in the questions and a most correct way to deal with it. You HAVE to use their methodology or they won't give you credit.",

Was able to pass, but it still grates me how much of that crap was completely foreign to me.\n\nI expected some struggle being that Im not coming from the grunt work in the field, but this was ridiculous.

    "content": "Hey there, everyone. This is a REALLY long post, so I apologize in advance. I just feel like these questions are best to ask people with first-hand experience. Thank you for any insight.\n\nI've been strongly considering joining the military to gain experience in the field and to get my foot in the door. That being said, I have a little background, I am 30, I have a business degree, and I've been working in management roles over the last several years. I and a few coworkers were recently laid off about a month ago due to budget cuts with the company and I have had 0 luck landing another role, either they ghost me, they never reach out after the interview, never reach out in general or nothing at all happens. This has been with I would say 100s of applications. I am looking for a change career wise. I always wanted to do something with IT but never did for some reason. So I am looking at it like this is my biggest chance, and it's now or never. Is the military a good idea for this?\n\nQuestions here.\n\nWhat branch would be the best for cyber? How long are cyber contracts? Are they all 6 years in every branch?\n\nWhat branch would offer the best QoL? \nThis would more than likely only be one enlistment, so it's not something lifelong, so I understand it's the military, and I'll be in a barracks, etc. \n\nWhat branches training would be the best for cyber?\n I've read different things based on the training provided, failure rate, what happens if you fail, etc. Any first-hand experience would be very welcome.\n\nWhat would transition best to civilian life?\n I've read some branches give you alot of certs, and some don't. I've read basically all give you a clearance which alone is valuable. \n\nWhat branch would also fit my age better?\nI've heard people say to commission, but I don't have a degree in computer science or STEM, so it's not possible. I also want experience, training, and learning the field. Also, I get it. It's the military. People younger than me, older than me, etc. Again, I'm not really bothered about it. They put in the time.\n\n-So last question is there any branch that does their job more over another?\nI've read various posts where people said they learned maybe a year of experience vs. their 6 year contract. Due to being pulled away from their job, etc. \n\nThat being said, I'm only interested in IT/cyber. So I believe AirForce would be out because the chances I've read of getting it are not likely. Since it's a 1-10 or 1-15 dream sheet shot. Army, I've read you can pick. Navy, I've even read you can pick, so that's another option too.",

      "The grass is always greener on the other side.  I know many jaded and burned out nurses/doctors.  You have something cushy right now.  I would keep it and find your fulfilment outside of work.  Get a hobby or a pet.  Volunteer somewhere.",
      "You may think they have a purpose but they are also burnt out and exhausted so pick your poison I guess",
      "I work in IT too, so I understand how you feel. I guess be thankful your didnt get stuck as a FE dev, I hate it now after 10years. \n\nTo be honest, I felt the same way recently. Due to severe rain and flooding this weekend, our natural gas water heaters broke. We had to call a technician from our national natural gas supplier to check for gas leaks and disconnect the water heater from the main gas line. I thought, How nice is this? He gets to be on the road, helping people out, making visits, and ensuring their homes dont explode. I was talking to him, and it turns out you basically just need to be a plumber to do this kind of work. It made me think. Beats pushing pixels around a screen dealing with asshole managers rushing and stressing you all week long for something so useless to human life. \n\nRegarding nurses, my two sisters are both nurses, and they are both burnt out. Theyre stuck in that wing for 12 hours on end. But to understand how you felt, when my partner gave birth, I watched the staff work, and it seemed like exciting work to be in a hospital. I get the same feeling when I go to the airportpeople and action everywhere. But I think there must be other factors to consider as well.\n\n\nIf you have the money do it. You live once. \n\nMaybe you can start by taking nurses aid courses to see if you really like it. Its a faster path to getting your feet wet. And if you like the work and the environment, you can continue with nursing school while you work.",
      "Probably too much screen time and not enough teamwork/networking?",
      "Heres the deal, youre young and already have a massive amount of savings that will compound incredibly well. Seems like youre in a LCOL or MCOL area too.\n\nWhy dont you and the wife read up on FIRE and call it quits early? Stay on this boring track for ten years and you can probably retire from the need to workforce and transition to doing whatever the hell you want at whatever salary.",
      "I had a desk job and hated my life too. I was 26 and decided to enlist in the coast guard, did 5 years and had a blast and now Im a firefighter. Really glad I left that desk job world.",
      "Honestly, I don't think it's crazy for you to want to pursue nursing. Tbh, with your background, you could move to healthcare technology or something related if you ended up not wanting to do direct patient care.",
      "Seems like you have come to the realisation that money isnt everything. Purpose drives us. Figure out what is valuable and has meaning and purpose and go from there. \n\nI found it in learning to do things for myself, helping street dogs and running D&D games. Explore, make something your passionate about your job and consider your paid job the means to do your real work, whatever your passion is.\n\nOr, you know, buy some land and become self sufficient.",
      "My wife was a nurse in a hospital for years and all her friends were nurses in hospitals.  Nurses do not come home fulfilled, I promise you (generally speaking).  They complain more than any other profession I've ever been around.  They get crap pay to be treated like crap and their bodies generally start to break down from lifting/moving overweight patients.  It's hell.\n\nOn your specific situation, it's up to your personality, but I'm someone who has A LOT of interaction in my current role.  I luckily found a new job, but prior to finding it I was looking into how to transition back to my old boring roles for a pay cut.  If your personality is really extroverted than great, go for it, but I was longing for my old boring jobs for over a year now.",

      "I think you are burnt out. Your brain needs a system reboot. Take a break from work, go on a small trip or vacation, or maybe start a new hobby. Anything that makes your mind off work. Gardening and meditation helps the most. \n\n>Its so fucking boring. I have little to no human interaction.\n\nJoin some camping/trekking groups or go to social events. I would not recommend online friends. \n\n>Ive been working in IT for 5 years now. I was wanting to jump ship to get to the 100k mark soon\n\nThe only way is to upskill. Decide what you want to do next, gather all info and practice a lot.\n\nLooking at the current market conditions and the job scenario, I would not recommend going to school and spending money on that. It's better to spend that on upskilling, time with your family and your health.",
      "Bro, jobs are to make you money not make you happy. You gotta do that on your own. \n\nFind out the flex in the position. Sounds like you have time and freedom. Upgrade your skills while at work. Take your lunches and decompress.",
      "A buddy of mine much older than you got sick of the back office Financial Services cube life, went back to school got the nursing degree and became an RN. He's now back in back office Financial Services cube life.",
      "I think if you became a nurse, you'd eventually long for the quiet days of not having to see people in pain and having to deal with a pretty toxic work environment full of people who are stressed out. \n\nYou are in IT. That is not a fun career. You're basically helping uneducated users fix simple problems most of the day. I get that. That is not a fun thing. Instead of switching careers, how about trying to move up. Become a manager. Become a developer. There are lots of options open to you.",
      "Ive been a nurse for 8 years now. The last 3 years, I have had 5 different jobs I quit on average 3+ months each job. Its affecting my mental health. The constant shift work, shitty nursing personalities, and bad work culture you come across day to day. I decides to quit nursing for good few weeks ago. Where am I going? Not sure. I will do anything to be in your position tbh but I understand where you coming from. Talk to your wife about how you feel, you can both do a weekly hobbies to ease the boredom like jogging, cycling, tennis etc. You can also upskill or do further studies in your profession, that can make you more marketable when you move on with your current position. Best of luck.",
      "Dude, you make good money and have an easy job. Life is not about work, find fulfillment some other way and stay where you are.",
      "Grass definitely always greener and its hard to predict how you may feel once youre in the trenches of another career. I majored in finance and graduated in 2014. Worked for 4 years then went back to school and became a nurse for many of the reasons you mentioned. I worked as a nurse for 4 years, got burned out and switched back to finance. Ultimately with kids, an office job provided more flexibility with work from home options and less stress as well as more income potential. Sometimes I miss those fulfilling moments where I was able to have a positive impact, but on the whole I was very grateful I had a solid career to fall back on. \nI dont regret trying it though-I think I would have always wondered.",
      "My sister works as a nurse. She's been screamed at by her own patients and their families. The human interaction you're looking for won't always be positive at that job. The work nurses do is important and can be rewarding. But it's also incredibly stressful and tiring.",
      "there was a senior software engineer in my accelerated nursing class and she told me she was there for reasons similar to yours. people talk shit on nursing but really youve just gotta work somewhere other than medsurg and be the change to discontinue the cycle of negative and cynical nurses.",
      "If you dont mind being pushed to your limits every shift having to multi task a thousand different things and if you make a mistake you can kill someone and get jail time, then it can be an option for you. Its also very hard to help people who dont want to help themselves. You see the same people over and over again who do not listen to what you tell them and it makes your work feel useless. However, there are moments when you truly do make a difference and save someones life, or someone turns their life around because of you. They will always remember you: their angel in their greatest time of distress. Every job has its pros and cons and right now you have a job that many people wish they had, including some nurses. If you want to see the down and dirty before diving in head first, try working as a CNA for a while. Hospitals are ALWAYS looking for CNAs. And pray to God we dont have another pandemic. Hospital staff suffered a lot and burned out hard during COVID.",
      "The grass is greener where you water it. \n\nYoure just in the wrong company doing the wrong work. The majority of my coworkers (with the same title) were previously sys admins. We work on troubleshooting and diagnosing server hardware at a data centerits a lot of continuous learning and collaboration. Just this year, the company has introduced 4 AI hardware platforms for us to learn and play around with. Lots of opportunities for collaborative projects with XFNs on a local and global scale.

      "Tbh, most nurses I know have had severe burnout since the pandemic and are going through a crisis of identity. Its never too late but this particular change might be hard. Id sit down with a few nurses first.",
      "I have spent most of my career working in 'meaningful' industries, mostly charities, mental health, domestic abuse services, that kind of thing. And now I'm desperately trying to find a 'boring' corporate consultant role because I'm sick of scrabbling around for tiny pay increases and carrying endless emotional burden.\n\nI'm not saying that you shouldn't consider a career change, there's happiness to be found in helping others. But for most people the shine very quickly wears off when you have to do it every single day. Except in those industries you don't also have the financial stability, holidays and comfortable retirement.\n\nMy advice is to find meaning outside of work if you can. A job will always end up being boring and difficult for most people.",

      "You have the job setup that many desire. The amount of people that move out from healthcare (ie. nurses) and education (ie. teachers) to \"desk jobs\"...I've lost count!\n\nIf you crave more human interaction, I'd say consider moving internally or look up jobs that require you to be on-site.\n\nFWIW, I go in twice a week to the office. I like and interact with my coworkers, then go on with my day once I clock out. My group isn't the type to hang out after work, if that's a factor for you.",
      "I was in the army, was always running around and wished for a desk job. I got out, got a job in IT, got bored from sitting around and not feeling fulfilled. Rn Im in Respiratory school with the hopes of getting my RRT-SDS (registered respiratory therapist with a speciality in sleep disorder). I feel like this would be a happy medium for me. A little of running around but also chilling out, and Ill get to help people. Do what you think is best for you and goodluck! ",
      "we arent that different. im in accounting and my wife is in medical. my job is boring and hers is a bit more fulfilling. financially, were in a similar situation but a decade older than you. i really like that i dont talk to many people. the general public is a nightmare to be around imo.... anyways, youre not too old to change careers but starting over sucks. do you have any interest in further education in your current field? you could make director level or cto one day with a masters. those titles would include more human interaction, if youre ok with constantly being in meetings.. is remote work an option for you? if the office is the worst part, remote days could help balance things out for you. im in office twice a week and its a pretty good balance for me.",
      "Maybe before you jump ship get a hobby or volunteer ? Tons of people have well paying boring jobs and are fulfilled by things outside of work. I would take a deep look at what your current job affords you. Then look at what you want to do realistically. Can you go to school and work? \n\nI wouldnt randomly give up 75k a year in this economy.",
      "Do you plan on having kids? Because that's life changing right there",
      "That would be a silly switch. Nursing is fucking hard and mostly thankless. I wouldnt advise that. If you really feel the need to escape your work and try hard just do demolition or landscaping. As the top commenter said the grass is always greener. Until youre mowing it",

      "OP do not make the mistake thinking Nurses have it all that\n\nI know plenty of underpaid and overworked Nurses that can't do anything about their current situations because Nurses have terrible working rights where I live and they don't go home every night feeling fulfilled, they go home to drink or smoke to numb themselves to all the bullshit they have to deal with day in and day out.\n\nAlso, your normal working hours you're used to? Forget about it. Say hello to 12+ hour shifts, going home, showering, scarfing down food, and falling asleep to repeat.\n\nNot saying you're definitely 100% going to get into Nursing, I'm just putting down what I know so you don't make the mistake of thinking the grass is always greener.\n\nIn my eyes, you have exactly what I want. I want to be able to coast at my job and make a great salary so I can save, invest, and own a home and start a family. I want the cushy job so that way I can find fulfillment through means such as hobbies and extra curriculars. \n\nI would recommend trying to pick up a new hobby first before thinking about jumping ship and trading what you have now for an unknown.",
      "Look into healthcare IT or biomed jobs. \n\nNursing for almost 10 years and the burn out is significant, most of my care is in Peds Oncology and float pool but its all the same. \n\nThere are moments of fulfillment and opposite. When you arent keeping your head above water its easy to enjoy, especially if you have a good team. \n\nThere are pros and cons. You meet patients you never forget, you make great friendships and you use a lot of critical thinking. \n\nIts also physically, emotionally and mentally exhausting. There are many personalities and egos and you have to juggle a lot. \n\nNursing allows many opportunities but floor nursing causes people to miss out on a lot. The hospital doesnt close: regardless of weather, local disaster, holiday, you will be worked into rotation. This is fine at 25, it becomes harder at 35.",

      "Your feelings and thoughts are completely valid. I want to start there. As someone who works in IT but is not in the same type of technical role, I do not even make as much as you, and Im trying to get there. If youre bored, Id say you can easily learn harder engineering tasks, but it wont be fulfilling. Definitely get you to the 100k mark. Id die to do what you do and have what you make, but Ive also been a worker in the hospital making really decent money like you mentioned THAT BEING SAID I came to IT from healthcare, and Ive never been more miserable than I was in healthcare.

      "Youre a Sys Admin and only make $75k? Id be looking to leave too. I also get your hesitance on leaving due to the tech landscape right now.\n\nWhy not go back to get your Masters in Computer Science? But also: certifications are everything in tech/IT. Personally, I dont think its worth starting over in a medical career unless you want to be a PA or something. Nurses dont make much more than you.\n\nYou could also get a tech job thats more hands on like in a data center or something like that? You could even look into working more on the engineering side of things. Im an IT Engineer and make $90k and I feel underpaid 80% of the time lol but the other 20% of the time when its dead and nothing is going on? I enjoy that time. I had a new guy start during the dead season last year (around the holidays) and he would ask me all the time, Is this it? Should we be doing more? I told him to enjoy the quiet while it lasts. Now hes telling me he cant wait for the end of the year so we can do nothing and bullshit at work for a few weeks haha\n\nYou could also look into trying to get a second full-time job thats remote so you can do both jobs at once. Ive heard of many people doing that in tech when they have a slow job, might be worth a shot and a good way to potentially double your income.",
      "do a 4 day week and volunteer in a nursing home for a few shifts? You'll find out pretty quick if healthcare is for you!\n\n  \nIf it is not, try more people focused roles in IT?

      "A sysadmin with a computer science background is far from \"making it\" in tech. There's so much you can do in your career that will give you fulfillment, like diverting into cyber security, software engineering, cloud engineering, etc. \n\nIf you have no desire to elevate your career and get fulfillment from that, then do what others are suggesting in hobbies. But it could also be that you're at the lower end of the computer science ladder when it comes to fulfilling jobs that you could be doing. Just my opinion",
      "Are you not a little bit over qualified for IT sysadmin? Could be because you are understimulated?",
      "As someone very familiar with nursing, do not go into nursing thinking that you will have a lot of positive human interaction. Nursing is very isolating nowadays. Hospitals are so understaffed that no more than one person can leave the unit for a meal break at any one time, so you eat alone. Everyone is overworked, so even if you need help with a patient, it is like pulling teeth to get another nurse to help you because he/she has a full load of critical patients, too. The hours are brutal (3pm-3am or 7pm to 7am for new grads) and do not allow for a life outside of work. Its exhausting. And thats not factoring in the stress of actually caring for patients in their worst moments. Dont just think the grass is greener.",
      "Get a master's or PhD in your field with scholarships covering your tuition and go into academia (more pay than you have now and just a few hours per week plus lots of human interaction). Or count your blessings, dont waste effort on more education and save more, invest and retire early, or start a business.",
      "I came from healthcare as a physical therapist. You need to look within yourself and not depend on your work to provide social outlets. Work on more sociable hobbies. Dont finish work and then just go home. Health care is MISERABLE, try asking one of those nurses if theyd switch w u in a heartbeat",
      "I did an accelerated nursing program and became a nurse when I was like 35 or so. \n\nI made over 200k last year easily. I've saved people's lives and I've made them feel better when they've been the worst they've ever been. I've seen crazy s*** and everyday has something interesting happen. \n\nIt's actually pretty fun once you're good at it. The first year or two definitely suck balls though. Highly recommend the ER if you're looking for keeping things interesting and actually making a difference. \n\nSometimes it's just handing out turkey sandwiches to a homeless guy who's drunk, sometimes it's literally saving someone's life. \n\nI enjoyed the freedom of scheduling that comes with it and the fact that I'll never be without a job or have to worry about a recession or anything like that. I have to turn down offers for jobs every single day. \n\nAll the stuff like blood and bodily fluids and smells and all that you just get straight up used to it and desensitized, it doesn't even matter anymore. I've literally had my hand inside of a man's necrotic ulcer scooping poop out with gloved hands and felt his tailbone, Life goes on. I got paid, got an interesting story out of it and many more. \n\nIn terms of return on investment for education along with job security and flexibility in terms of what you actually do, setting that you work, and scheduling, nothing else even comes close",
      "I'm a nurse. It's hard AF.\n\nThere is a severe shortage of nurses and it's only going to get worse over the next 30 years so you can write your own ticket in this field. So many directions to go in, not to mention GREAT income. 3 12 hour shifts is amazing for work/life balance.\n\nYou can start out with just getting your RN in 18 months. Get a job in a hospital, get them to pay for your BSN. With all advanced certifications (100s! or more) you make more money. \n\nSeriously, YOU can write your future.

      "You could try nursing informatics. Youd be perfect for that, but it would require you get a BSN to be in a tech role. You might like that, though. If you want to do nursing, I would suggest something like OR or NICU. Wound care nurses also seem to like their roles but, obviously, wounds can be pretty gnarly. Go into r/nurses and search the sub for phrases like who actually likes their job and the like. I am not a nurse (Im not anything, yet), but I looked into it for a while. I have an older criminal background, so I left that dream behind. \n\nIf you reconsider a career switch, maybe you can explore finding a happy medium and look for tech roles in hospitals?  Maybe a nonprofit (although, that has its own challenges)?  Or, look for some government positions? \n\nYou could get your CNA license and pick up a year worth of shifts (I know you wouldnt be able to work a full schedule, with your other job) to see if you even like nursing, at all. If you like being a CNA, I think youd like being an RN. You just need the appropriate amount of time to realize it. If you hate it, then you didnt leave your other job, nor make a full-blown career switch. If it does work out, you have a year of CNA experience under your belt, which will help when you look for work as an RN. Another benefit of getting your CNA and working, first, could be tuition reimbursement. The hospital may pay for you to go back to school, in full. Im not sure if you have to meet a certain amount of hours (i.e., a full-time work schedule) or if you have to work there for a certain amount of time to qualify for tuition reimbursement, but thatd be the way Id go. Yes, being a CNA sounds like a bit of a nightmare Im not gonna lie. But, if you can handle that, youll have a good idea of whether or not you can handle nursing. \n\nIm sure they will appreciate more male nurses!",

      "I would recommend volunteering at a hospital before taking the plunge into nursing. I personally know 5 nurses. Every single one of them is burnt out. 3 of them switched to the office side of nursing, the other two are in the process of trying to get out altogether. \n\nA couple of years ago my brother needed brain surgery. There was a complication during the first surgery so he had to have two surgeries in the span of a month. My sister, mom, and I all took shifts to be with him around the clock. I lived at that hospital for like two solid months.

I'm choosing a field that I can do until I cognitively cannot anymore, and that is somewhat disability proof. I caution you to think of your whole life, and not just this moment, and be savvy with your choices. Look around on job specific subs, connect with your friend's brother who is a respiratory therapist, or your neighbor who is an ICU nurse. Be practical and critical with your choices ...and good luck, most of all. I hope something fulfilling comes to you.",
      "I was a burnt out CPA distracted by the internet at 25 with similar grievances, and still a burnt out CPA at 35, before I did anything about it. (still distracted from CPA-ing as I type this)\n\nI found my way into some manual labor type things, fully self-employed now, looking to scale it into a small business.  I still do some CPA-ing to feed the fam while the other work I just reinvest everything into that endeavor.  I didn't really see any sense for me in the option financially of going back to school just to come out the other side at entry level, so I went the DIY build a business route.  Fortunately as office drones tend to do, I had some hobbies that I enjoyed extensively, which actually prepared me for this second career.\n\nIt's the struggle of my life trying to pull this off, financially taking a hit for sure, but so much more fulfilling.  I wish I did something about it 10 years ago.  The type of overwhelming unhappiness that is boring desk work, corporate culture, and useless meetings out the bunghole for a guy not made for that stuff, I would not wish upon my worst enemy.  But in the economy we live in, it's just where most of the jobs are at.  I was choosing my major in 08-09 and was just looking for gainful employment.

If you want to get satisfaction from your job and rely solely on that for your sense of self and purpose, you won't be happy in pretty much any job.\n\nEarn as much as you can to fuel your hobbies and your own personal pursuits, don't rely on your job to provide you with fulfillment.\n\nYou will become accustomed to every job you get, so it will all eventually feel boring (especially if you have ADHD). \n\nIf your job or career is sucking the life out of you and you get home too drained to focus on anything else, it is definitely time for a change.\n\nThe main point is not to let your job dictate your sense of purpose or sense of value. Pursue things outside of work that you enjoy or always wanted to pursue. I rely heavily on a range of hobbies for fulfillment because I relied on my job for fulfillment and never found it.\n\nIn your case you hate the isolation of your career and if that is negatively affecting you then changing to something with more social interaction would be beneficial but please don't convince yourself that it will be any less boring once it becomes your normal.\n\nGood luck!",

He found the change fulfilling and now enjoys a carefree, happy, single life in his 40s, investing in cryptocurrency with the financial freedom to do so.\n\nIf youre not planning on having kids or dont have significant financial commitments like debt or a mortgage, you could consider a similar path. It really comes down to what you valuedo you live to work, or work to live? I chose to work in the disability sector because its something Im passionate about, and despite the challenges, I find it deeply fulfilling.\n\nWe spend about one-third of our lives working and another third sleeping. How do you want to spend the other two-thirds? If youre thinking about a career change, make sure to do thorough research. Nursing, for example, has its own set of challenges. Another option is to work in IT for a nonprofit organisation. The pay might be lower, but youll know your efforts are contributing to a meaningful cause.\n\nOr, you could continue in your current field and use your free time to volunteer or pursue something meaningful.

The choice is yours.\n\nGood luck!",

I bailed on that and went back to school, got a PhD, and am now a Professor. My job is just as easy as my corporate gigs, but 1000000x more fulfilling.

      "Hey, \n\nI was like you once. 10 years ago, I was 25, and a sysad. I fucking hated it. I quit and became a brewer at a local brewery. I loved it...for about 2 weeks. \n\nWhat I realized is that it wasn't the work that bothered me. It was the environment I was in. \n\nI don't know exactly what's going on in your noggin. That's up to you, but what I found is that 90% of my experience at work is based on the environment I am in. The people around me. Not the actual work.\n\nI quit that brewery job, and it ultimately killed my hobby of home brewing too. I went back to IT and found a pretty great company to work for. Now, I run the IT department. \n\nAs far as purpose. You got to find your own meaning in the situation you're in. Finding another job might do that, or you might end up in the same mindset in just a different role.\n\nPersonally, I find purpose in my job even now because I know what I do has a direct impact on how people are getting paid at my job. If a certain app isn't running, people aren't getting paid, and with most people in the world living paycheck to paycheck, I feel obligated to make sure these folks are getting the money they deserve to support their families. \n\nBut I understand your sentiment. Before this, I was in the military. I swept for IEDs in Iraq and Afghanistan (Route Clearance). Your purpose is a lot more cut and dry in those types of situations, and it's the same for nursing. Protect and save lives. \n\nIt was difficult for me to find a purpose again. Took me almost 15yrs to figure that one out. But I would encourage you to look at those things before making the plunge to a different career.",

      "Hey there - similar journey to my own but I'm a bit older now (42!) and remember when I was in a rut around that age. \n\nFirstly, looking back on 30, it's really not old, and you could have several career changes yet and still be in a very good place financially etc, stability wise. Don't overly worry about being incorrectly skilled, you have a lot of time and boy, coding / marketing skills are not about to become low-value, right? they are also reliant on some fundamentals which are very transferable from one task to another. \n\nNow - you have an infinity of options, your problem is narrowing them down. \n\nWhat do you enjoy? think of fun, think of passion, think of times when you've really felt like you were in the zone / flow and time flew.

I'm an introvert, I prefer working alone, I have been in frustrating roles that were 5+ years in the making several times before which started well then got boring or stupid (managers, companies etc). \n\nI'm just starting out on my coaching career, I've always done it with employees and such.

      "I think part of it is your phase in life. At least when I was 30, it was for me. 30 is a tough age career wise, because you feel like youre supposed to have your path figured out by now. You largely identify yourself by what you do for a living. You started going to school when you were 4 years old with the purpose of getting a good job. But now that youre there, its unfulfilling and you cant imagine doing what youre doing for 30 more years without blowing your brains out.\n\nI was a Business Analyat until I was 30 and was in a similar mental space as you are now. Didnt know what I wanted to do or what options I had, so went and did an MBA.\n\nGot into management consulting focusing on tech strategy. Did it for 3 years and that was even worse.\n\nSo 5 years after I left my original job I returned to that same employer in a different division/role, doing a job that is half Business Analyst work, half strategy/management. And I love it. And half the reason I love it is because I like the people I work with.\n\nIm nearing 40 now, and with a wife, 2 young kids, and a house in constant need of repair. Having a job that Im good at, doesnt stress me out, pays the bills, and working with people I like, is a godsend!\n\nMy advice is do whatever the fuck you want. Even if you dont have an income for a while. Travel. Make mistakes. Even just dont work for a while.\n\nYou're 30 - you have money, youth, and time. You wont have all three of those ever again.

      "45 years old and am in this big time, since the Pandemic. I used to be a preschool teacher, went $80k debt in student loans for it. Then, hated it. I've been in Customer Service ever since.\nI feel like I'm having a mid-life job crisis. I'm facing the fact I'll never have a job I actually enjoy going into AND that enjoys me coming in AND pays my bills. I'm facing the fact that I should have never tried to find a job for personal fulfillment, just something to fulfill my bank account and retirement.\nI have to ask myself why/how I grew up thinking it was feasible to find a meaningful job I could love that paid well. I'm pretty sure it's because teachers used to tell us it was better to be poor and happy than rich and miserable. But that is a very privileged and unrealistic attitude. They showed us charts of how a college degree, by default, will pay more than not having one, so it doesn't matter what you get a degree in, just go get one. I had it my head that anyplace I spend a minimum of 40 hours a week at would be the center of my life, how I define myself and who I am. That the only measure of success is how much you're willing to give your employer. I wish I had been raised that work is something you have to do, do not make it the center of your life and do not define yourself by it, don't kill yourself or relationships for it. Do not put coworkers on the level of family, do not put them before your personal friends. Do not think of your boss as your God, with supreme authority over your life. Do not plan for life around a job. I wish I had learned to keep my work life in a little box that I only opened while I was there. But I grew up with this family and culture that put your job first. That whatever work needs, you do whatever it takes to make them happy, no matter how miserable it makes you or your family. That you have no right to personal-work boundaries. So you better at least enjoy the actual work, because that's all you have control over.\nSlavery. Employment is just slavery. The attitude is that an employee is a slave. We haven't even had 40 hour week weeks as the law for 100 years yet, in the US. We don't have federal legal requirements for paid sick leave, even.\nI grew up with a dad that went to work every day, no matter what. Unless he was sick enough to go to the hospital, he went to work sick. He worked overtime every time it was an option. He cashed out vacation time instead of taking it because they were always behind on work and he wanted to be a \"good\" employee. He believed his loyalty and dedication and never complaining meant something. It did not. He didn't get raises. He didn't get promotions. He was there 40 years. In the same position. And when he was getting too old and slowed down a little, they wrote him up everyday until they had enough documentation to fire him.\nMy dad hated that job. My entire childhood, he was too tired and in a bad mood every day he came home from work. Then on weekends he was too tired to do much with us, and too stressed about going back to work to be involved with us.\nAnd now I find myself in the same situation with my own kids. But I'm a single parent, so it's even worse for my kids. They don't have another parent sitting at home all day waiting to wait on them, like I did. No parent anxious and eager to get out the house for the weekend and do something. Instead, I come home thinking out l about how I was shit on all day, wondering how I'll pay my rent if I get canned for not picking up enough extra shifts. Or how pissed I am that I got blamed for a mistake I didn't make and couldn't prove it. Or how the girl in the cubicle across from me spends the entire day on her phone texting and Facebooking and watching TikTok because she knows the rest of us will get the work out. And being physically exhausted at 45 years old, but I have to keep working until my 70's to qualify for a meager Social Security stipend. And I'm missing my children's childhood.\nI thought about that a lot when I was a preschool teacher. I was not allowed to have my own kids there because I couldn't afford it and they were afraid of favoritism. So I spent more awake time with other people's kids than my own, and more than their own parents spent with them. And I used to think if these wealthy families would just give up so much luxury, one parent could just stay home with their kids, instead of shelling out $1k+/month on tuition for each kid. In fact, most said they were only having one kid because they couldn't afford to have two kids in childcare. Okay, well you don't need this years Mercedes. You could get by with a 10 year old Kia, you know. You don't need to live in a gated community, or even a single family home at all. You could *GASP* rent an *FAINTS* apartment!\nI've come to the conclusion if you aren't the plantation owner, you are not an equal human. You are just another piece of property. Indentured slavery to prove you've earned the privilege to wake up every day.\nI'm sick of playing this game, but I can't exactly just refuse. It's hopeless, imo. I hate this life.",

I do not have a it degree and it is an entry level position however there are issues I have with my future there. It's my understanding the  community of it and development do not require a four-year degree unless it is at a very intensive or niche area, and there are many companies that have moved in the direction of acquiring a certification boot camp or other methods to grow skills. Currently my department has said my only promotion would come from going to get another four year degree, or becoming proficient enough and python to pass an exam for a junior test engineer. However the issue with that is that you can do no training on the clock, and there is no assistance seeking education. So better yourself you have to find your own time to do so and there is no direction of what would be the best education to get. Also the company currently does not pay industry standard to developers or other staff, so there's no guarantee once completing my education that the company would pay appropriately. Currently I would not make 40K given current company raises at 1.7% per year till maybe 2026 or later. I see technology as a way to provide for myself and have a better life, and if I can find a niche to pour myself into I think I would really enjoy it more. Currently I'm considering finding some way to improve a skill and jump into another company next May, unless there are changes in my department. \n\nCan anybody offer an advice on what direction to go for education or certificates?

    "title": "Seeking Advice on Transitioning from Telecom (RAN Engineer) to IT (Cloud Roles) - Need Guidance!",
    "content": "Im currently facing a dilemma and could really use some advice from this community. To give you a bit of background, Ive completed my BCA(Bachelors in Computer Application) and am now in my 2nd year of MCA(Masters in Computer Application). Im exploring job opportunities and have found an opening as a RAN Engineer in the telecom industry, which seems like a great start in terms of gaining technical experience.\n\nHowever, my long-term goal is to transition into the IT industry, specifically into cloud-based roles. Ive been working on building relevant skills in cloud computing (Im AWS certified cloud Practitioner) and have a strong interest in roles like Cloud Engineer, DevOps, or Cloud Architect.\n\n**My Concerns:**\n\n1. **Skill Relevance:** Im worried that starting in a RAN Engineer role might not align well with my future goals in IT. Will the skills and experience I gain in telecom be transferable to cloud roles in IT?\n\n1. **Transition Path:** How can I best navigate a transition from a telecom-focused role to an IT cloud-based role? Are there specific skills, certifications, or experiences I should focus on while working as a RAN Engineer?\n\n1. **Career Path:** Has anyone here made a similar transition from telecom to IT? What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them?\n\n**Why Im Asking:**\n\nI got the RAN Engineer job through campus selection and accepted it because I couldn't land a job as a fresher in Cloud, core IT, or SDE roles. While Im grateful for the opportunity, Im concerned about being pigeonholed into a niche that might not align with my long-term career goals in IT. Im hoping to make informed decisions now that will set me up for success down the road.\n\nAny advice, personal experiences, or resources you can share would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

      "My 2c, is be sure of where you stand and what you want. I had many years in IT across totally different disciplines before I knew I wanted to specialize in Identity and Entra/Active Directory, despite having worked in AD at many of the prior roles.\n\nFor me, it took a while for me to learn what I wanted to really specialize in, or perhaps even that I WANTED to specialize in something.\n\nIf you already fairly know you want to work in cloud (good choice), go for it! It sounds like you were not doing anything more relevant to cloud work before the RAN job, so no harm there IMO. \n\nYou can surely transition to cloud work when you are ready, and I think it's easier than you imagine. Work on some professional certifications, whether that be AWS, GCP or Azure. Look for some roles opening up that fit your experience - whether that be Junior Engineer, Operations, perhaps a helpdesk hybrid type role...\n\nI'm sure if you can get a few baselines certs, and get your foot in the door and show your passion for cloud and what you have learned it will take off for you."

    "content": "I am a CS student considering a switch to IT. I am 30+ years old seeking career transition. So far, CS is hard; I don't feel I have the energy to sustain a CS career for the rest of my life (it's very demanding). I still like programming and want to learn more about computers in general, so that's why I am now considering IT. Does that sound like an acceptable reason? What's your advice for me? If I was to continue my CS degree to completion, would I have qualifications for appying for IT jobs (perhaps along with some certifications)?",
    "comments": [
      "I come from a CS background in undergrad and I became an IT Business analyst. Not sure if thats of interest, within IT field but not a traditional IT role. I program every day and Im constantly coding data pipelines to support IT processes. I love my role as I work with all teams throughout IT, and Im learning about all aspects of technology in business. Im used as an internal consultant and bounce around a lot. In terms of certs, I have an AWS cert\n\nIn a sentence, I think your reason makes a ton of sense but it could be worth it to investigate IT roles that may not be traditional IT.",
      "Getting into IT is easy.  You dont need certs (they help), you don't need a degree (it helps).  You can literally snag a level 1 call center job that offers you paid training (granted you're looking at like 15-20/hr pay, which is 30-40k a year).  Stay there for a year or 2 and you'll be able to transition nicely into other places because they'll see your high ticket volume capability and know you can handle it when its busy as hell but will enjoy the drop from 60 tickets a day to 5 tickets a day, but getting paid 50k or higher.\n\nAs a contractor who has hopped around in different fields (legal, government, medical, entertainment, sports, finance, education, MSP, and Mom & Pop), I recommend the legal field.  Partners are a pain in the ass but the pay is usually higher, everything is usually well structured and well documented (at least in a good law firm) and the problems are easy.  There's a nice 'ladder' for progression and at that point all it takes is time or good timing/luck.  \n\nIn about 2-4 years you'll likely be at 50k or higher.  \n\nThis is how I got up in the world, I'm now an EUC Engineer making 100k and working from home.  I also have directed people to this route, and for the ones who stuck with it, they're doing well in the IT field as well.  As long as you can handle a year or two of hell....because those call centers will be hell....you make it out on the other side smelling like roses.\n\nBut I will tell you, IT is CS (assuming this isn't some weird acronym and does mean Customer Service).  You will talk to people and some will try your patience to the extreme.  Until you get to level 3 which is specialized and you're doing things like networking, infrastructure, security, etc.  If you want to jump right into those, you need certs and/or a degree.",
      "Sounds like a very good reason to me. Im sure youre gonna get a lot of people in here saying IT is hard too, blah blah blah. But in my experience CS career requires a different kind of mind than IT. And IT has plenty of jobs that are far less mentally taxing. Not to mention CS majors have to take way more math classes to learn all those algorithms, which isnt for everyone. Theres plenty of IT jobs out there that feel more like trades than anything, and some pay very well.\n\nQuick edit - IT also has some jobs that are extremely mentally taxing, but you can choose not to go down those paths"

    "content": "I don't know about y'all, but I have become a bit disenchanted with the industry. Admittedly, I began as a full stack developer during a high point, mid 2020 and I never imagined things would so quickly take a turn for the worst. I can't even log into LinkedIn without having to come across a bunch of posts about layoffs. \n\nWhile, I haven't been impacted yet, I have developed a somewhat adversarial perspective towards employers which I didn't really have before.  I genuinely feel an anger and distrust towards companies and employers and hate what they've done to my fellow devs. I am working through that as I don't want it to fundamentally change who I am. \n\nI am taking steps to manage my angst by now taking very seriously the advice, \"A Leetcode a day keeps unemployment away\"  and I'm actively interviewing, just in case. I don't love that I have to be in this state of paranoia to work in this industry, but I love the lifestyle it affords me so I'm willing to do what it takes to stay ready so I don't have to get ready. \n\nWondering how my fellow devs are coping,  especially those who have only worked in tech during a bull market, do you feel yourself also becoming disenchanted, bitter or paranoid?",

      "Yeah, it's good to have a healthy distrust toward employers, they are just employers and you are just an employee, the relationship is extremely transactional.\n\nAlmost everyone will encounter in their career lows like job loss, whether it be layoffs or performance.\n\nMaybe you had a very rosy view of work in general and this experience is recalibrating you, and you're not even affected (yet).",
      "I was the one doing the layoffs, and it's noticeably changed my perception of the industry.\n\nI spent over 20 years making games, where the pay isn't great and the hours are long, but people keep going out of passion for the work. Then I went to FAANG, where the hours were way more sane, the pay was 3x higher, but there was still all this talk of mission, caring for employees, and culture, and long-term investment in people's success.\n\nYes, on one hand you realize that it's a business, that corporations have no soul, and that at the end of the day it's all about money. That's just logical. But after \\~25 years of it *not* working that way for you or the teams you manage, it becomes easy to forget that, and assume that's only the case for other -- dare I say \"lesser\" -- places to work. A certain arrogance sets in.\n\nSo much for that, eh?\n\nAfter 8 years of building teams of hundreds of engineers at FAANGs, and bending over backwards to respect and reward and grow them to the point that even during the Great Resignation, my yearly attrition rates were <0.5%, along comes Wall Street and the c-suite and tells me I need to summarily fire 10%+ of them with about two weeks' heads up. Via spreadsheet. I didn't even get to decide who. Everything was reduced to a number.\n\nWhy? Because our profit margin fell from billions of dollars to slightly less billions of dollars. Heaven f\\*&ing forbid.\n\nI still intend to treat my engineers like actual people, and try to shield them from this soulless stupidity as much as I can, with the obviously limited-but-still-considerable power that I have. I'm not going to succumb to cynical self-interest. But I don't ever trust anyone above me to feel the same way again. Turns out the people at the very top of these companies are just as mechanical, heartless, and dishonest as everyone always told me, and I didn't believe them.",

There is a boom and bust cycle, but an entire generation of tech workers only ever experienced the 'Boom' part. \n\nThe sky is not falling, this will pass. If it feels like you were safe before but now you aren't, all that has changed was that you learned that that 'I'm safe' feeling was just a false sense of security. \n\nSorry, but this is what white collar jobs look like in literally every other industry.",
      "It hasn't really changed my impression much.   I joined the industry in the early 2000s, companies have always had hiring sprees and layoffs.     \n\n\nOlder tech companies like Oracle, Microsoft, IBM, Cisco, HP would regularly cull divisions every couple years.   Sometimes good employees would get wacked, sometimes they'd dodge and get recruited to another team, sometimes you're unemployed for six months etc.    \n\n\nEven when FAANG emerged as the super awesome place for devs to work, Amazon, Meta, G, and Netflix would regularly manage folks out pre-pandemic.  Sure some folks could coast depending on your manager, but it wasn't guaranteed.   I knew people who lost their jobs at those places before the layoffs, just like I know people who got rich from these companies.\n\n\nI guess what is surprising to me is that so many people came into the tech industry thinking it was a magic industry that was guaranteeing riches, perks, and job security...",

Nothing about what is currently happening has changed that. I've been laid off before; it sucks. That's why I live below my means and save a lot of my salary. It's gone up 5x from what I started at, and I'm still living in the same house I bought 6 months into my career.

Remember there are lots of people [outside of this industry] that think $20/hr is a good wage because they have never seen that much at a job.  Maybe people are realizing that even though you are in this field you are just an employee, and your only value to a company is increasing profit or stock prices.",

It was an exhausting cycle of last-minute prep followed by long technical rounds. Luckily, I was able to land an internal position by the end of February. Ive kept the same salary and benefits so Ill consider myself luckily but my workload has increased.\n\nIts definitely changed my perspective. I had been employed for nearly 2 years with the company and told I was safe before leaving for paternity leave, so I hadnt even thought about interviewing or prep. Now, I think Ill do at least some prep every 3 months or so. Also, as some others have mentioned, the job market for Jr. and entry level positions is almost non-existent. I have friends who have recently graduated or have 1-2 YOE applying for job after job with no success. I had no issue getting interviews (specialized field, 7 YOE) for mid and senior level. I think it was in part due to having contacts/recruiters at other companies.

      "One thing we need to remember is that the the goal of all companies is to make the highest profits for its investors, private or public. So if they can lower their cost through layoffs, offshoring, AI (no code tools), merging with other companies etc they will do it. \n\nProviding jobs, & careers is just the cost of doing business, incidental to the goal of the company. So we as workers just need to find the best fit & become as valuable in our current or new employers. And we need to save n live below our means when times are good, bad times always come. Markets are cyclical and always changing. We need to stay on top of current trends and tech, always be learning. Remember how Detroit economy collapse when car manufacturing went off shore, coal mining jobs gone etc \nJobs move, shrink in one area expand in another.\n\nI have been a dev in several roles, for over 20 years, I was a Jr Dev during the dot com bust of 2000 that was a masacre, way worst than it is now it felt like the world of IT was ending. I knew some Sr Devs & DBAs that could not find a job for a year during that time, I was a Jr Dev hardworking with domain knowledge I got lucky since I was cheap during that time but I have also been though a few layoffs either companies completely shut down or merged or got acquired n  getting laid off always sucks, throws ur plans out the window, sometimes it depletes ur savings, sometimes you take a salary cut, sometimes u work in a supermarket to make ends meet in the meantime. \n\nBut one of my early layoffs, it opened the opportunity to buy my first home ironically, I managed to find a job with in 5 weeks n with my severance package I had enough for a down payment on my first home (a townhouse). So yes  Leet Code, keep interview skills up, take note of where the industry is going & what opportunities open up. And for Gods sake, live below your means and save! ",

I already was skeptical of the industry I worked in, but now I see that a lot of companies are ran by narcissists and sociopaths.

For me this hasn't changed my feelings on the tech industry, but I'm not currently at a big tech org. It has given me hope that the industry might move past FAANG and respect practitioners overseas and elsewhere in the US. \n\nI never had any desire to pursue big tech in CA (or other major hubs). Startup/Faang culture I've found to be incredibly toxic. Rampant elitism, pushing of poor development practices, micromanagement culture, continual navel gazing with disregard of prior industry accomplishments, and complete disregard of ethics on numerous axis directly leading to rampant extremism in the US on both sides of the political spectrum.\n\nI'm hopeful that some good comes out of this. Hopefully some reality sets in that these orgs are not looking out for developers and that talent can / should look elsewhere. Hopefully some really cool organizations form with fresh angry developers wanting to take down their former employers. Hopefully a slight return to normalcy for those of us that were watching a weird insular bubble grow around a couple places that REALLY needed developers interacting with the world outside of an episode of Silicon Valley.",

      "I think you should distinguish between **tech company** layoffs and other industries. Most other industries are barely touched by layoffs. The problem with big tech is they over-hired and over-paid, based on absurd long term growth projections that were unsustainable, not too different from the Dot Com Bust of the early 2000s.\n\nThe software development field has stabilized. But there is something seriously wrong with the management (or I should say, the **investors**) at Big Tech though. They sold Gen Z a bill of goods and lied to them about the proliferation of jobs and money in this field, and after a huge surplus of developers entering the field it's now contracting back to where it should have been in the first place.\n\nIt's a bad time to be inexperienced and trying to break into this field. The competition for entry level and internships is fierce. I do not envy at all. And if it were me I'd probably go back to school for an Engineering degree (which was my original major). Engineers have no trouble finding jobs, and they have the best salaries around now.\n\nIf you have development experience, there are a **lot** of jobs out there right now. Recruiters are calling me daily, the most calls I've gotten in 20 years, and they are almost all remote jobs and almost all paying more than I make. I have senior friends who have been jumping jobs at will the past year. And they are raking in the dough.\n\nBut I would be careful about just blaming \"employers\". For the most part employers just want to run their business and earn a profit. They're not out to get you. If they are not hiring, instead of insulting them you should try to understand why and figure out what they *are* hiring for. My manufacturing company brings in lots of Engineering interns, experienced Engineers, and hourly labor all the time, because the business is doing well. What they are *not* hiring is any software developers, even though we badly need more. Because they are just too expensive and the company has decided they aren't worth the cost for what they get in return. So that means that every project is now being slowed down, delayed, shelved, or canceled. So we just have to make do.\n\nHowever they are hiring IT people, probably another 5-10 by the end of the year. But they have stopped hiring developers. Financially if you do the math, you can get 3 -4 IT people for the same cost as 2 devs. So that's what they are doing.\n\nBusiness budgets are all about priorities and return on investment.",
      "Lay-offs are reactive rather than anticipative. They're executives trimming the fat to compensate for a bad quarter rather than them anticipating future trends. There's even the trick of tacking on 'fat', well-paid seniors in non-essential roles that are the first on the chopping block come the time that shareholders need to be placated.  \n\nLay-offs they tell us something about the recent past not the future.  \n\nAnd that's not to say that anyone who currently got laid off was non-essential. There's always collateral damage as well. Not throwing shade on people who just got fired. At least, not all of them.",

It was extremely difficult finding jobs and I worked at 2 different companies that almost went under and laid off massive amounts of employees before being bought out by other companies. \n\nI learned a valuable lesson early on in my career. A job is never guaranteed, and thinking you'll always have a job because you're a \"good boy\" and hard worker is an ignorant belief. Even in good times companies can go through restructuring or the owner can want to sell and the new owners can come in and cut out half of the current work force. \n\nAlways always always have at least a 6 month emergency fund. Before making any kind of large purchase make sure you are in a very solid financial position to do so. \n\nNever get attached to a job or company. When it comes time for layoffs they'll let you go and say something along the lines of \"we really like you but this is just a business decision etc\". \n\nA job is just a job. It doesn't define you. Show up, work, get paid, be smart with your money so you're not dependent on a paycheck every week. Times might be tough right now but that will change.

I dabbled a bit with HTML web design at one of my roles 4 years ago and honestly I loved it. \nIve been doing some very minor HTML at my roles ever since but it isnt the main premise of what I do.

PM jobs have been cut down significantly in the last 2 years and project teams have been reduced quite a bit.

You cannot apply to many internships otherwise I had discovered. Biggest con is that school is really expensive and this is the most expensive route. \n\nBut like everyone else is saying the tech market is so rough right now. If it were me now, I would not transition at this time. Im in the Bay Area and personally know of people in the tech space  that were laid off.",
      "I do have a different opinion not focused on the market. First, learn to code. If you can and you enjoy it, know that working for a paycheck doing it will drain some of the enjoyment. So, with that out of the way, look into a Computer Science degree. You may even be able to completely one fully online. If this is not an option then I would start working on a portfolio or building and launching your own apps. Regardless if you do a CS degree or not that's a good way to start.\n\nAfter that it's just a matter of getting your foot in the door. The easiest way is to join a consulting or development shop that makes websites and apps for clients. The pay is low and the demands are high but that's the easiest way to get into software development. Two years there making apps over and over for clients will give you some really solid experience. From there on the sky is the limit. You just have to always be learning new processes, technologies and keeping up to date with the industry and trends. The people complaining here saying there are no jobs are correct, but that may (or may not) change in a year or two, or more. The people here also complain because they can't easily get a job paying 150k+ a year anymore at big tech, not because they can't get a job for peanuts in a sweatshop (at least not yet) but that's where you'll need to start unless you are extremely luck and talented at the same time.\n\nMore likely than not, you'll get stuck in the first step and give up. That's usually how it goes. If you can't learn to code on your own with all the available resources out there online then this field is probably not for you. HTML is not coding and not representative of the field of software engineering but it is one thing you should know if you work on the web.",

I throw any resume with that shit on it now, its a waste of my time even interviewing them.\n\nI know I'm going to trigger some self made dev or lighthouse person but I don't care.",
      "> Im thinking of leaving the PM life as there hasnt been any growth and several cuts in the last couple years. Not to mention severe burn out. (Thats a rant for another time).\n\nCould you expand on this a bit more? Your experiences might shed insight on those wanting to do a PM job in tech. Thanks!\n\nAlso, if I were you, this is the plan that I'd follow (we are basically in similar situations):\n\n* Look into certificates on Coursera and/or Edx. Learn from here and start building a portfolio.\n\n* Similar to the above, check out theodinproject.com, freecodecamp.org, fullstackopen.com, and roadmap.sh\n\n* Study algorithms and data structures. Check out /r/leetcode and leetcode.com and start grinding right now. If you enjoy this, also check out janestreet.com/puzzles\n\n* I haven't actually looked into it myself a whole lot yet, but consider the [O'Reilly Online Learning] (https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/individuals.html) service. They have a lot of good books so it might be worth having access to all of them. \n\nAnd finally, as other's have mentioned\n\n* Consider or plan for a master's degree in CS or something related. Good options for people that can't take time off exclusively for school: UT Austin's Online Masters of Computer Science, Georgia Tech's OMSCS, Harvard Extension School Online CS (very expensive but you'll be an official Harvard alum after completing it (not a HC alum mind you)). Start by taking online community college CS classes to get accepted into UT's or GT's program(s). \n\nThe market is brutal right now. So unless you have special connections or a very impressive resume, it will be very hard to get interviews. You are already starting off disadvantaged without a CS degree. It will be even harder to get an offer after you start interviewing too. \n\nOnce you start interviewing, aim for non-remote jobs as those are less competitive. Aim for rural or non-tech centered locations. Aim for non-profits or government jobs as the competition for those jobs isn't as high compared to big tech or finance. If you have another citizenship, consider looking for work outside of the US too. \n\nGood luck!\n\nedit: added more"

We're seeing companies do 2-3x phone screens and 1-2 rounds of interviews on top of onsite gauntlets now -- not even factoring in the fact that on-sites to offer conversions have drastically dropped. Combining all of the previously mentioned, you're looking at potentially 40-50 rounds before a solid offer (4-5 companies). To rub salt in the wound, compensation has notably lowered as well as the market becomes more saturated with supply of engs, and obviously job security has plummeted.\n\nSpeaking strictly on just the interview and job hopping process, tech is rounding out to be the worst of all careers from this aspect and it's incredibly annoying.",

I wouldn't want to read this wall of text if I were a recruiter.\n\nAnother thing that will help greatly is putting concrete numbers to your achievements/experiences. As an example, using one of your bullet points instead of saying \n\n    \"Developed prototype software to detect and count cars in a video stream\"\n\nPut a value to this, as the facts and figures stand out to the eye when skimming a resume.

You're trying to get strictly into a software dev position, so I think the Hardware Engineer and Design Engineer work experience can be deleted from your resume altogether.

You probably already know this. But if you are unemployed and do not have some topic you are trying to skill-up in then... I don't know. If you have all day and no job or other major responsibility then there should be 4+ hours every day to put into the next skill.\n\nI do know that with your coding background you could sit down with JavaScript and Angular/React and be building webapps in some number of months.

This should be one page.\n\n2) You say you are working as a software developer, yet you have a gap from December 2018 to July 2019 and not only that, but you only worked from July 2019 to November 2019 - what happened there?

    "content": "I spent close to 2 years in a well established mid sized tech company after my bachelor's in CS. I loved coding. I enjoyed solving Codeforces problems and I loved learning algorithms.\n\nBut my work never involved a single \"Algorithm\" or \"Leetcode\" related task ever. I was programming in React and JavaScript and literally never understood the depths of stuff like render cycle or promises or whatever was required for my job. Whenever I had to write basic components, I knew what to do and got it done. Whenever I got to a certain bug, or some kind of an authentication issue, or build failure, I absolutely hated it. On top of that, I never understood how to bloody write tests. I never understood what's with mocks or wrappers or whatever this entire domain requires. I somehow got stuff done because I had a friend who helped me at work and always knew a way out.\n\nI interviewed for another company to take a step back and see how good I was at interviews. I nailed the leetcode rounds because I'm good at that. When it came to writing a React component, I literally had so many issues with syntax and errors which made me realize; I copy pasted react/JavaScript code for 2 years without even learning the basic syntax. I was so embarrassed because I came in to the interview with my \"years of exp\" and I fumbled so badly.\n\nTaking another step back, I realized that every project I had done in my life, was always something I wrote from scratch. I never really contributed to open source or got my feet wet with REAL codebases because I just felt like it was \"too complicated.\"\n\nThis whole thing of leetcode being used as a reference point for someone's engineering abilities may have fucked me over to think I'm good at engineering, but I'm not.\n\nI understand the overall architecture and engineering at a decent level. When I need to look at code to FIX it, I have no interest. And making that shift from one tech stack to another, learning new technologies and new languages just seems so boring. I don't even know what the fuck goes on during builds, or code splitting, or pipeline or whatever terms you toss at me. I don't want to go that deep and figure out why things are/aren't working.\n\nMy ego got in the way of my career. I thought I was good at programming. No. I'm good at algorithms and leetcode. I'm not good at software engineering.\n\nI'm thinking of making a career transition into something like technical product management or whatever. I have an exterior understanding of software. I like problem solving. Maybe I'm good at strategies? I always think of things that can go right/wrong and I'm cautious of different aspects. I noticed that specific aspect in me while gaming. But idk.\n\nHave there been any others in this situation? I really don't know what the fuck to do.",

That itself is a great insight.",

As in, youre not just going to understand the JavaScript event loop just by writing JavaScript code.\n\nGo spend some time really digging into how it works. It takes effort.\n\nThe people Ive seen that do really well early on in their careers are people who put in the effort to figure out how things work, going beyond the daily duties of completing whatever random React component you need to complete this sprint.",
      "I have the literal opposite problem. I never studied DSA and can't leetcode to save my life, but I am an expert in troubleshooting and fixing broken code or finishing something I don't understand in the slightest. I have the same imposter syndrome you have, in an ideal world we could give each other everything we know and be twice the developer we both are. What you need are methodologies to bail you out when you are stuck. I have developed troubleshooting methodologies from years of doing everything from HVAC to building agricultural robots. Some of these may not apply to you considering you are a web dev and I am embedded / robotics but here is a list of everything I do.\n\nStart at power: May seem obvious but the first thing you check when something isn't working at all is power, do the old off / on again or even literally take a meter to the power connection to check it.\n\nTake measurements: whether they are electrical measurements or timing measurements or print statements. Find a way to test different parts of your system for bottlenecks and to make sure code is being activated.\n\nFind a comparable system: find something extremely similar to what you are trying to do and understand what it is doing.\n\nReview documentation: read all source documentation you can find related to the problem, there are many nuggets of wisdom that won't be obvious that can be hidden in the documents.\n\nGoogle the problem: lol oldie but Goldie always Google that shit.\n\nIsolate parts of system and develop tests: find way to test individual parts of the system to assure what you are trying to do is being done, they call this unit testing I believe but it is a skill that takes time to get good at.\n\nReview your assumptions: if you designed something to work and it isn't working, you very well could be making a wrong assumption somewhere. Check all your assumptions without ego.\n\nUse version control: constantly using version control allows you to test different parts of a system in a roundabout way, you can think you are fixing something, somewhat fix it, then break it again and have nothing to go back to. Version control helps you fix that.\n\nInspect visually and check all connections: for physical devices this is far more important also known as the wiggle test, I am sure there is some web dev version of this with endpoints or something idk.\n\nStay calm, do not get emotional: Never get too attached to an idea or fixing something in a certain way, it can completely blind you to the real issue and end up making you look foolish.\n\nCut things in half: cut you data, arrays, memory whatever in half, this can allow you to find many problems related to bottlenecks, overflows and other issues. It is a general rule that has served me very well when I have been stuck.\n\nGuess and check: just start changing stuff that you think may be relevant, this coupled with version control can allow you to gather the information required to isolate the problem.\n\nFind all information related to the system: software version, compliers, language version, what system it is running on etc, this lets you find the once in a while odd ball problem many other engineers don't look for.\n\nAsk for help: even if the other person doesn't help you directly, this can inspire new ideas and bring other viewpoints into the problem.\n\nKeep track of ideas surrounding the problem: write them down, keep a list in notepad++ whatever. Keep track of your thoughts on the issue and review it. I have all these things written in a notebook I keep in my bag, Every time I solve a new problem I write it down.\n\nThere are more things I have on my list but it's longer than I remember and much of it isn't applicable to you so I won't list them all here, just understand everyone has a different set of skills. Work on your weaknesses but play into your strengths, what different companies want is completely random. All these things have served me well in the past but seem foreign to many SWEs I have dealt with. You are cut out for software development, it just takes time to get good at the different aspects of it. Don't give yourself imposter syndrome over it.",

Oh, and don't feel bad for hating React, it absolutely sucks lol.  \nPlease dont overestimate yourself now and think you can go into some higher (more abstract) role.

      "Hitting the gym is great for building a strong body, but let's be honest, those bicep curls won't exactly translate to real-world situations (you probably won't encounter a boss asking you to do 50 jumping jacks or lift a box 20 times in a row). In the same way, LeetCode can be a programmer's gym  it strengthens your coding skills, but the problems you solve there might not be directly applicable to everyday coding tasks.",
      "I see what you're saying. Yes the real SWE job is vastly different from the puzzle solving, deterministic nature of leetcode.  \n  \nBut what I don't understand is how you're planning to assuage this gap in technical product management? That field has more unknowns, more meetings, and I think more of everything that you dislike about SWE and further away from \"leetcode\".",
      "Definitely don't want to do something that makes you miserable, but when you get authentication issues and things like that, do you dread it because you don't understand how it should be working? I find that's the case in most people, and they just have to be shown how it works or dig in a little bit more to the fundamentals. \n\nIn terms of React, I think the FrontendMasters course on React does a great job of explaining what problems React solves for you in a way that's not overwhelming. They also have authentication courses, and Pluralsight and similar places also have things. Sometimes it's a little easier to spend a little time in that than digging in yourself, especially when you're not sure where to start. \n\nFeel free to reach out for questions or guidance if you want and I can see if I can help. \n\nSide note - I'm guessing you prorastinate some, and all it really is is your brain wanting to avoid things that cause negative emotions. Not knowing how to do something causes a negative emotion. Software Engineering is *hard* and pays well for a reason. \n\nYou have to retrain your brain to approach the problems differently where not knowing something can be a positive, or at the very least have a strategy for what you do when these situations occur. Something like a checklist. \n\n* Do I understand what's supposed to happen? \n* Is it doing the thing I expect it to? \n* Am I sure that it is because I saw it happen while debugging, or am I assuming it is because that's what I think the code is doing?\n* Have I read the documentation for examples?\n* Have I created the most basic working solution possible for this scenario in a separate small project (like a quickstart or tutorial)?\n\nThis is basic, but modify it to fit your need. If you're working on troubleshooting an issue that spans your whole system, you might add some steps. I know you probably feel overwhelming in general, but having a strategy to tackle these things takes away a bit of the unknown parts. It's overwhelming to look at a problem and say I don't even know what to do here. You start with the checklist so you're working on smaller problems rather than the whole big problem and do small pieces at a time.",

      "OP - you sound exactly like me 3 years back. When I transitioned to a \"real\" engineering company where I had to build services and write frameworks from scratch or build on other people's work, I was totally lost. I considered myself good at coding as I equated LC to real coding but reality of eng work is far far different. \nHere's what I'd suggest(which worked for me)- \nfirstly, take it slow. You're just 2 years into the industry. As you're already interested in LC, I feel you'll eventually like software engineering as well. Your current \"hate\" towards eng or unwillingness to learn is likely coming from the fact that you're displeased with your perf.\n\nGet a senior engineering mentor in your team or sister team that can comment on your work directly. Catch hold of him/her and get your code/designs reviewed diligently and request aggressive feedback. \n\nWhile doing this, participate in every single code/design review that you can get your hands on. It can be totally unrelated to your tech stack but take this opportunity to understand the choices. Use these sessions to understand the thought process behind a certain class, design choices, why use this over that etc.. Comment during live reviews, pull requests, design docs, oncall etc.. Chat or setup calls 1-1 with other person and try being the devil's advocate. Remember that our goal is to learn the best, absorb the other person's expertise and eventually build something like them. Dig to the very deep until you REALLY understand the barebones. The end goal here- you should be able to explain this design or code with clarity to someone outside your team independently and even answer their questions. In the process, you can sound ignorant when asking trivial questions but that's totally fine and acceptable for a rising engineer.\n\nThis approach is certainly time consuming. It might look like you're not making any progress. But trust me, with diligent progress, you'll start seeing results. Continue doing this over the first 5 years of your career and you'll reap in leaps and bounds later. Best wishes!",

      "The problem with software engineering is that the better you get the worse you think you are.",
      "You're discovering the difference between solving little self-contained coding problems and real world software engineering. Most code is edited 10-20 times more often than it is written. And all of the non-glamorous stuff you mention, bugs, authentication, concurrency, mock testing, etc. is an essential part of getting software to production. You will have to develop a knack for recognizing and fixing things like poor syntax (though IDE's and copilots help with that these days). Troubleshooting and bug fixing is its own completely separate skill and discipline. It's like cooking an omelette vs. running a restaurant.\n\nBut you are definitely far from the first person that finds that heads-down coding is not for them. If you ask around to your product and people leaders you will find that many of them started out as coders and found it wasn't for them. I talked to one business person that said they spent 2 hours staring at a block of code until they realized there was a misplaced comma and that was the last time they did any coding. Doing enough coding to understand how it works allows people in those roles to relate to the engineering in a way that non-coders can't so that can be valuable.",

What you need to do OP, is figure out how you get yourself out of the low and feeling like a programming god again.

If you love algorithms and leetcode then you're probably better suited for backend work. I'm the same way. I love code architecture and data structures etc. I absolutely hated when I had a front end react job.\n\nEdit: also 2 years in you're going to suck. I'm 5 years in and still suck. It's a lie that you're good at programming after college",

On then other hand I love diagnostic issues with software, debugging, architecture, cloud infrastructure etc In my 5 years of experience I almost never faced any leetcode type of issues and when I did I looked up a solution and tailored it to my needs. I think its just a matter of the type of job you find. Stay away from web development I would say and maybe try data science or the car industry for low level programming.

I really don't know what the fuck to do.\n\nI certainly recall a point in my career when I realized I was not investing in some things I should be if I wanted to advance my career. But for me I was genuinely curious to get more deeply familiar with the technologies I was interested in working with. I didn't have the problem of viewing any topic as boring, but rather I had the problem of having to make a choice of which area I wanted to focus on.\n\n>I'm good at algorithms and leetcode. I'm not good at software engineering.\n\nAt your level of experience this is normal. Very few CS programs have a serious focus on software engineering as a discipline and a lot of CS grads are expected to develop those skills within industry.\n\n>I'm thinking of making a career transition into something like technical product management or whatever\n\nI would consider whether or not you have a similar viewpoint of these other roles that you had with the software engineer roles, i.e. your assumption of what the role demands of you is fundamentally wrong and so your expectations will be misaligned with what the role expects. I would suggest that you ask yourself what it is you actually want to do, and figure out if there are roles that actually line up with that. You sound like you like to hack together working solutions for customers quickly, which are the core skills for consulting and sales engineer roles.\n\nSales engineering and solutions architect roles are interesting because a company selling services along side their products will need to train a set of skilled programmers to present solutions to customers who want to leverage the product solution but don't have the internal staff to actually leverage it without some support. As a sales engineer your concern is primarily the customer's level of understanding, and not the deeper level the engineers who develop the product have. Typically sales engineers are a bit of a dry-run for product documentation and tend to be the first to file bugs before the product hits customers. Often a sales engineer will be guided around how a product is intended to be used and how it can be customized, and isn't necessarily expected to have a deep understanding of a system.\n\nSales engineers are often entitled to a portion of the commission of the sale, depending on how compensation is structured. However, the current labor market isn't favoring sales-centric roles, so while this may be a good fit for your career interests there may not be an abundance of open roles at the moment outside of the AI startup world.",

My role solely exists so they don't have to worry about infrastructure and pipelines and they can solely focus on their code. \n\nBut also? Relax. You're a baby with barely 2 years of experience.

As long as you understand these core concepts, rest would be easy. If its not working for you, its  time to learn.

The future is learning how to develop a way of thinking that plans for the future and solves problems on the horizon. Not how to prioritize performance or memory, these are already problems of the past.\n\nWe all do it, we learn a framework that abstracts a recurring problem like how to manage a form state and then in an interview they ask you to manage the state of an input. That problem was already solved. Write a sorting algorithm? What a waste of time. Don't give up just yet, you've identified your weaknesses, it's a game of try and try again.\n\nToo often we expect intense results in a short space. Acknowledge where you've grown and build on where you're weak and remind yourself with the things you're good at.",

Anyway you're not a good fit for Software Engineering as you said, if you're not interested in digging deep and learning then there's nothing you can do really, copy-pasting can only take you so far. \n\nI think it's okay, this isn't for everyone anyway, do what makes you happy and change."

If you do decades of WordPress you will have a hard time getting big tech to ever stop thumbing their noses at you.\n\nAnyways, I contend that specialization can be broken down into a very simple algorithmic problem. It's a random walk that tries to maximize your current state without perfect knowledge of alternate states, and has an accumulator lets call it experience which stores past states.\n\n> Simple stochastic games (SGs), e.g. [17], are zero-sum games played on a graph by players Maximizer\nand Minimizer, who choose actions in their respective vertices (also called states). Each action is associated with a probability distribution determining the next state to move to. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.09465\n\nOne example is we can choose a Bound Value Iteration algorithm. Here specialization would appear in the bounded values over multiple iterations. We can imagine choosing a terrible specialization would 'pidgeonhold' your job search algorithm by reducing the upper bound initially very quickly. This works both ways as it would also reduce a recruiters upper bound as well if that is strategy they are using to evaluate candidates. \n\nThe thing that changing states repeatedly would do is it would normalize outcomes. Thus if you want a career above normal you would sabotage yourself by doing something too cushy for too long. It's worth reading through the above paper.",

It won't matter for a lot of higher positions either, unless they're looking for highly-qualified experts in a particular area.

    "content": "I'm drunk and I'll probably regret this, but here's a drunken rank of things I've learned as an engineer for the past 10 years.\n\n* The best way I've advanced my career is by changing companies.\n* Technology stacks don't really matter because there are like 15 basic patterns of software engineering in my field that apply.  I work in data so it's not going to be the same as webdev or embedded. But all fields have about 10-20 core principles and the tech stack is just trying to make those things easier, so don't fret overit.\n* There's a reason why people recommend job hunting. If I'm unsatisfied at a job, it's probably time to move on.\n* I've made some good, lifelong friends at companies I've worked with. I don't need to make that a requirement of every place I work. I've been perfectly happy working at places where I didn't form friendships with my coworkers and I've been unhappy at places where I made some great friends.\n* I've learned to be honest with my manager. Not too honest, but honest enough where I can be authentic at work. What's the worse that can happen? He fire me? I'll just pick up a new job in 2 weeks.\n* If I'm awaken at 2am from being on-call for more than once per quarter, then something is seriously wrong and I will either fix it or quit.\n* pour another glass\n* Qualities of a good manager share a lot of qualities of a good engineer.\n* When I first started, I was enamored with technology and programming and computer science.  I'm over it.\n* Good code is code that can be understood by a junior engineer.  Great code can be understood by a first year CS freshman.  The best code is no code at all.\n* The most underrated skill to learn as an engineer is how to document.  Fuck, someone please teach me how to write good documentation.  Seriously, if there's any recommendations, I'd seriously pay for a course (like probably a lot of money, maybe 1k for a course if it guaranteed that I could write good docs.)\n* Related to above, writing good proposals for changes is a great skill.\n* Almost every holy war out there (vim vs emacs, mac vs linux, whatever) doesn't matter... except one.  See below.\n* The older I get, the more I appreciate dynamic languages. Fuck, I said it. Fight me.\n* If I ever find myself thinking I'm the smartest person in the room, it's time to leave.\n* I don't know why full stack webdevs are paid so poorly. No really, they should be paid like half a mil a year just base salary. Fuck they have to understand both front end AND back end AND how different browsers work AND networking AND databases AND caching AND differences between web and mobile AND omg what the fuck there's another framework out there that companies want to use?  Seriously, why are webdevs paid so little.\n* We should hire more interns, they're awesome. Those energetic little fucks with their ideas.  Even better when they can question or criticize something. I love interns.\n* *sip*\n* Don't meet your heroes. I paid 5k to take a course by one of my heroes.  He's a brilliant man, but at the end of it I realized that he's making it up as he goes along like the rest of us.\n* Tech stack matters. OK I just said tech stack doesn't matter, but hear me out. If you hear Python dev vs C++ dev, you think very different things, right? That's because certain tools are really good at certain jobs.  If you're not sure what you want to do, just do Java. It's a shitty programming language that's good at almost everything.\n* The greatest programming language ever is lisp.  I should learn lisp.\n* For beginners, the most lucrative programming language to learn is SQL. Fuck all other languages. If you know SQL and nothing else, you can make bank.  Payroll specialtist?  Maybe 50k.  Payroll specialist who knows SQL?  90k.  Average joe with organizational skills at big corp?  $40k.  Average joe with organization skills AND sql?  Call yourself a PM and earn $150k.\n* Tests are important but TDD is a damn cult.\n* Cushy government jobs are not what they are cracked up to be, at least for early to mid-career engineers.  Sure, $120k + bennies + pension sound great, but you'll be selling your soul to work on esoteric proprietary technology. Much respect to government workers but seriously there's a reason why the median age for engineers at those places is 50+.  Advice does not apply to government contractors.\n* Third party recruiters are leeches.  However, if you find a good one, seriously develop a good relationship with them. They can help bootstrap your career.  How do you know if you have a good one? If they've been a third party recruiter for more than 3 years, they're probably bad.  The good ones typically become recruiters are large companies.\n* Options are worthless or can make you a millionaire.  They're probably worthless unless the headcount of engineering is more than 100.  Then *maybe* they are worth something within this decade.\n* Work from home is the tits. But lack of whiteboarding sucks.\n* I've never worked at FAANG so I don't know what I'm missing.  But I've hired (and not hired) engineers from FAANGs and they don't know what they're doing either.\n* My self worth is not a function of or correlated with my total compensation.  Capitalism is a poor way to determine self-worth.\n* Managers have less power than you think.  Way less power.  If you ever thing, why doesn't Manager XYZ fire somebody, it's because they can't.\n* Titles mostly don't matter.  Principal Distinguished Staff Lead Engineer from Whatever Company, whatever.  What did you do and what did you accomplish. That's all people care about.\n* Speaking of titles: early in your career, title changes up are nice.  Junior to Mid. Mid to Senior. Senior to Lead.  Later in your career, title changes *down* are nice.  That way, you can get the same compensation but then get an increase when you're promoted.  In other words, early in your career (<10 years), title changes UP are good because it lets you grow your skills and responsibilities.  Later, title changes down are nice because it lets you grow your salary.\n* Max out our 401ks.\n* Be kind to everyone.  Not because it'll help your career (it will), but because being kind is rewarding by itself.\n* If I didn't learn something from the junior engineer or intern this past month, I wasn't paying attention.\n* Oops I'm out of wine.\n* Paying for classes, books, conferences is worth it.  I've done a few conferences, a few 1.5k courses, many books, and a subscription.  Worth it. This way, I can better pretend what I'm doing.\n* Seriously, why aren't webdevs paid more? They know everything!!!\n* Carpal tunnel and back problems are no joke.  Spend the 1k now on good equipment.\n* The smartest man I've every worked for was a Math PhD. I've learned so much from that guy. I hope he's doing well.\n* Once, in high school, there was thing girl who was a great friend of mine. I mean we talked and hung out and shared a lot of personal stuff over a few years.  Then there was a rumor that I liked her or that we were going out or whatever.  She didn't take that too well so she started to ignore me.  That didn't feel too good.  I guess this would be the modern equivalent to \"ghosting\".  I don't wish her any ill will though, and I hope she's doing great. I'm sorry I didn't handle that better.\n* I had a girlfriend in 8th grade that I didn't want to break up with even though I didn't like her anymore so I just started to ignore her. That was so fucked up. I'm sorry, Lena.\n* You know what the best part of being a software engineer is?  You can meet and talk to people who think like you.  Not necessarily the same interests like sports and TV shows and stuff.  But they think about problems the same way you think of them.  That's pretty cool.\n* There's not enough women in technology.  What a fucked up industry.  That needs to change.  I've been trying to be more encouraging and helpful to the women engineers in our org, but I don't know what else to do.\n* Same with black engineers.  What the hell?\n* I've never really started hating a language or technology until I started becoming intimately familiar with it.  Also, I think a piece of tech is good if I hate it but I simultaneously would recommend it to a client.  Fuck Jenkins but man I don't think I would be commuting software malpractice by recommending it to a new client.\n* That being said, git is awful and I have choice but to use it. Also, GUI git tools can go to hell, give me the command line any day.  There's like 7 command lines to memorize, everything else can be googled.\n* Since I work in data, I'm going to give a data-specific lessons learned.  Fuck pandas.\n* My job is easier because I have semi-technical analysts on my team. Semi-technical because they know programming but not software engineering.  This is a blessing because if something doesn't make sense to them, it means that it was probably badly designed.  I love the analysts on the team; they've helped me grow so much more than the most brilliant engineers.\n* Dark mode is great until you're forced to use light mode (webpage or an unsupported app). That's why I use light mode.\n* I know enough about security to know that I don't know shit about security.\n* Crap I'm out of wine.\n* Being a good engineer means knowing best practices.  Being a senior engineer means knowing when to break best practices.\n* If people are trying to assign blame to a bug or outage, it's time to move on.\n* A lot of progressive companies, especially startups, talk about bringing your \"authentic self\".  Well what if your authentic self is all about watching porn? Yeah, it's healthy to keep a barrier between your work and personal life.\n* I love drinking with my co-workers during happy hour.  I'd rather spend time with kids, family, or friends.\n* The best demonstration of great leadership is when my leader took the fall for a mistake that was 100% my fault.  You better believe I would've walked over fire for her.\n* On the same token, the best leaders I've been privileged to work under did their best to both advocate for my opinions and also explain to me other opinions 'that conflict with mine.  I'm working hard to be like them.\n* Fuck side projects.  If you love doing them, great! Even if I had the time to do side-projects, I'm too damn busy writing drunken posts on reddit\n* Algorithms and data strictures are important--to a point.  I don't see pharmacist interviews test trivia about organic chemistry.  There's something fucked with our industry's interview process.\n* Damn, those devops guys and gals are f'ing smart.  At least those mofos get paid though.\n* It's not important to do what I like.  It's more important to do what I don't hate.\n* The closer I am to the product, the closer I am to driving revnue, the more I feel valued regardless of how technical my work is.  This has been true for even the most progressive companies.\n* Linux is important even when I was working in all Windows.  Why?  Because I eventually worked in Linux.  So happy for those weekend where I screwed around installing Arch.\n* I've learned to be wary for ambiguous buzz words like big data.  WTF is \"big\" data?  I've dealt with 10k rows streaming every 10 minutes in Spark and Kafka and dealt with 1B rows batched up hourly in Python and MySQL.  Those labels can go fuck themselves.\n* Not all great jobs are in Silicon Valley. But a lot are.\n\nFinally, if you really want to hurt me, don't downvote I don't care about that. Just ignore this post. Nothing makes me sadder than when I wrote a long post and then nobody responds.  So if you hate this post, just ignore.",

      "Oh shit I found beer: let's keeping going.\n\nOn programming languages:\n\n* I once hated a programming language (C#) until I started using it.  Now I hated it but think it's useful.\n* Then I started hating a programming language (C#) and left it and came back.  Wow, that programming language has really improved.\n* The greatest thing about functional languages is that functions are first class and all other programmers know that.\n* No matter how great or superior a language is, it doesn't matter if people don't use it.\n* Learning a language isn't hard.  It's learning the ecosystem.\n\nOn coworkers\n\n* Pair programming is great, it just takes a lot of time--time that the company usually doesn't want to spend.\n* Working with smart engineers has made me a better coder.  Working with smart non-technical co-workers has made me a better engineer.\n* Don't spend time outside of the 9-5 working.  Unless you want to because you got a banging project and you're in the groove.  That shit is awesome.\n* Happy hours and social hours across teams are 99% just chilling and getting to know coworkers.  That's cool.  Every once in a while, the 1% is about a critical project with a critical piece of code and you're glad you brought up work in a social setting because shit would've hit the fan otherwise. I'm not saying that I should hang out with other teams outside of work because of this.  I just want to bond.  But it sure as hell is a nice perk.\n\nOn working from home\n\n* If the company is half remote and half on-site, it's important to determine if the remote people aren't treated as second-class citizens.  If major decisions are made \"at the water cooler\", then it's better to try to change the company culture (hard) or move on to a different company that treats its remote employees as first class citizens.\n* The second worst major downside of working from home is no whiteboard.\n* The first major downside of working from home is that it's hard to learn from coworkers.  Unless I'm (a) confident and assertive to ask questions and (b) the company has a culture where remote workers are equivelent to on-site workers, I think it was best that I worked on-side for the first 5 years of my career.\n\n\nOn technology\n\n* Everyone knows that tech changes.  The tech landscape of the past 10 years has changed dramatically.  But fundamentals don't change very much, especially fundamentals that apply to my field.\n* Hacker news and /r/programming is only good to get general ideas and keep up-to-date.  The comments are almost worthless.\n* There's a lot of vocal amateurs with strong opinions about technology. Even amateurs published on \"respectable\" journals and blogs. I found it to keep abreast of the rumors but to figure things out for myself.\n* I work at a cutting edge startup and we don't use the latest XYZ tech that was present at ABC cutting edge tech company.  And it turn out, what they usually present is only a small percentage of their engineering department and that most of them are using the same tech we are.\n* That being said, it's important to read the signs. If you want to work with modern tech and you're company is still doing the majority of it's development in jQuery, might be time to re-evauluate.\n\nOn Data Engineering\n\n* Fuck it I'm a data engineer so I might as well give more specific, target advice/experience\n* SQL is king.  Databases like MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, SQL Server, SQLite is still supreme.  Even if you work with new tech, most of it transfers anyway.\n* Most companies aren't doing streaming.  It's hard and complicated.  If you're 10 years into your career and you don't know how to work with 10k records per second, don't worry about it, there's still jobs out for you.\n* Airflow is shit, yes.  There are other products out there, but fuck me if Airflow isn't the most widely used.\n* Machine learning projects are highly prone to failure.  They're complicated and hard to implement.  Don't believe me?  How easy is it to write fucking unit test a machine learning model?  Yeah.\n* Our field is new.  There's no good book on data engineering, just go and \"do it\".  Can't learn it through a bootcamp and shit.  This will probably change in 10 years as we all figure out what the fuck we're doing.\n\nOn Life\n\n* People die.  Do you want your code to be your legacy?  If yes, then spend a lot of time on it because that's your fucking legacy and you go!  But if you are like me, your legacy is surrounded with family, friends, and people in your life and not the code you write.  So don't get too hung up on it.\n* Good people write shitty code.  Smart people write shitty code.  Good coders and good engineers write shitty code.  Don't let code quality be a dependent variable on your self worth.\n* I got into tech and coding because tech was my hobby.  Now my hobby is is the same as work and work has ruined my hobby.  So now if I want to enjoy tech I need to quit my hobby.  Or I need to be OK that tech is no longer my hobby and find new hobbies.\n* Programming and computer science is like, what, 80 years old?  Compare that with any other engineering discipline.  Yeah, we collectively don't know what the fuck we're doing.\n* I'm making pretty good money.  Be grateful and appreciate.  Also, save.\n\nOther shit\n\n* I've built large platforms and libraries that are used by multiple teams and people for many years. Yet for some reason, the most proud I was of the code I wrote was the small script that was used by me.\n* The proudest accomplishment of my career has been helping other people be better at their jobs.  That's probably because I'm destined to be a people manager, so this is probably not helpful to other people.\n* When I was looking for a job, I created an updated my Linkedin. I got shit replies and deleted it.  Now I use Linkedin to find other candidates to join my company.  Bottom line, Linkedin is a lot of noise.  I only find it valuable because now, part of my job is contributing to that noise.\n* Once, I found out in college that a girl liked me. I didn't believe it because I had poor self esteem, but then she asked me out.  I told her I wasn't interested even though she was really cool. That was one of the proudest moments in my life because I as mature enough at 19 to say \"no\" in a mature way.\n* /r/cscareerquestions is such a cesspool of ego and misinformation that I don't know what to do about it.  Like, WTF.  I want to shake all those people and try to explain to them how the world really is, but they wouldn't believe me.\n\nOn my general feelings right now\n\n* I'm drunk and I usually don't drink, so I would think that everything I say is probably cringy or terrible\n* I feel strongly that people should save and invest money. If you have a 6 figure salary, do your best to max our your 401k please.\n* I've become what I've always hated: someone who works in tech in a career but avoid tech in real life.  Maybe that comes with being old.\n* /r/ExperiencedDevs is a pretty cool community.  Thank you mods.  You get way less appreciation than you deserve.  Seriously, thank you.\n* I probably owe my career, my salary, my life to Reddit.  Reddit gets a lot of shit but the communities here have lifted me out of poverty (working at a gas station earning min wage) to learning Linux, SQL, python, C#, Python, and others to get me where I am.\n* Kids are great.  I don't have kids by choice.  Why?  Because I love kids and I'm scared about what kind of father I would be.  Oh shit, is that too personal for a post here?\n* Once, someone asked me who I looked up to and I said Conan O'brien, and they laughed at me.  But I was being serous because on [his last show on the Tonight Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcF1OoWqXBc), he told his audience to be kind and work hard.  It happend during a difficult period of my life, and when I watched him say that, I said, you know what, I'm going to do just that.  Because what would I have to lose?  And you know what?  I've met some brilliant people who I've learned from over 10+ years because I was kind to them.  And I've grown a lot by working hard and not being afraid to try new things.  And my life is infinitely, infinitely better because of those words.  So yes, it might seem silly and even ridiculous to say that I've achieved a level of fulfillment in my life because of a late night talk show.  But you know what, fuck it, it's my life and I will proudly say that I owe any success I've achieved because a fucking comic on late night television.\n\nI'm highly intoxicated so please disregard anything I say.  Also apologies for ranting.",
      "Oh man I love the responses.  You all are friggin awesome.  On the whiteboards: yeah it's not the whiteboard per se.  It's the collaboration on a whiteboard.

      "On the subject of documentation, here is a fun and friendly technical writing course that you can read and practice the basics.

      "You are not wrong about documentation, which is really hard. There's a chapter about comments in a book from the 90's called \"The Practice of Programming\" by Pike and Kernighan, An example they had has stayed with me: it was from code for a telephone system, and it had a comment saying that Italy and South Korea get a special value for some flag, and then the code after it does this for like Italy and Brunei. Which is wrong, the comment or the code? A typical scenario is that the code got updated, in response to change, but no one changed the comment. So guess the code is correct. But, they ask, that aside, why are two seemingly unrelated countries given special handling? If it's because they still haven't switched to center-negative enturbulator connections in their phone switches, then the comment should say that.  Just having a comment hanging there with no explanation is almost pointless - you can see from the code that there is a special case, and the comment gave you no information. It's basically an \"increment the counter\" comment, except that it serves some purpose by calling your attention to there being a special case in the codebase.",

      "As a junior dev who had a fantastic mentor and came from an aerospace engineering background here's my advice on documentation:\n\n* Start it at the beginning. I mean like even before you write your first line you should have a basic flow diagram of how you expect things to look.\n* What's that you say? You aren't starting a new project? Yours is 10 years old and there's almost no documentation? Well when's the second best time to plant a tree? Today. Start writing your own documentation and show it off during your merges. Go around and ask the other devs to share their documentation with you. Everybody writes stuff down whether it be for designing or to help them remember, sometimes it just takes someone willing to put it all together.\n* Make updating your docs part of your merge process. Yeah you don't need or want to add every change to it, but at least have them read through the relevant portions to make sure they didn't miss anything.\n* Just write shit down. Formatting documentation is great for delivery but how many times have you looked at the index of your documentation instead of just doing a Ctrl + f? If you learn something interesting about the code. Write that shit DOWN. Take a minute to see if a relevant section exists, If it doesn't then just make a new section and write it down. You or another dev will thank you later.\n* Flow diagrams and block diagrams > words. I have yet to find a paragraph that explained something more clearly than a picture in software. Yes they often go hand-in-hand and more often than not they should. But if you have to choose which one to start with, choose your block diagrams and flow diagrams. Use block diagrams to capture complex objects, if I have a class that has multiple layers of child classes beneath it, I make a giant block and a bunch of smaller blocks within it, then add a brief description of each class, and use arrows to show important dataflows. I haven't found a way to show inheritance clearly though. Block diagrams are also great for visualizing dataflow through a system, and for simple objects that have a unique purpose (as is often found in \"clever\" or opaque code)\n* Use color. When you're making your diagrams take a few extra minutes to color your blocks. It makes it look less scary, more readable and honestly who doesn't love playing around with a digital paint palette?\n* Write your documentation for your devs, not your customers. You guys are the ones using it so write it so it makes sense for you.\n* Make it easily accessible and searchable. I've been doing everything on confluence. Yeah the version tracking is virtually non-existent, but if the documentation is just designed to show the current state of the code then who cares? If you want to do version tracking, then export it and track it with your repo I guess? I still haven't found a good way to do that with formatted docs.\n* Lead from the front. Everyone should be doing documentation and that starts with your lead or architect or whoever everyone on the dev team looks to for guidance. If they see that the lead is documenting then they will too.\n* Don't make it mundane. If you aren't delivering the docs then there's no reason it has to be professional. A friend of mine who was a sailboat captain told the crew he was training that they could write anything they wanted in the log as long as they still logged the important stuff. I tell my team a similar thing. You can write whatever you like in it as long as it captures what the code is doing.\n\nI hope that helps. If anyone wants to talk more about it or critique or add to this please do. I just started as a lead on a team of 4 including myself. We were given a side project and I just kinda ran with it. So I'm just taking what I've seen work in the past and trying to use all that to guide my team now.",

      "Thanks for sharing, that is a helpful perspective to learn from. Ill try to repay the favour by passing along some documentation tips. I havent found a good course on it either, but I do work in support and improve our client-facing doc whenever I have time, often based on user feedback. Sorry if any of these sound too obvious or arent applicable for your specific audience, but hopefully they will help someone.\n\nThink Cotton-Eye Joe for the topic being documented:\n\n- where did it come from (input-wise)\n\n- where did it go (output-wise)\n\nA lot of the questions we get are related to the above eg what field in the database was involved, what conditions triggered a calculation/omission. Keeping the requirements and expected behaviour up-front is key, as well as any limitations.\n\nI often get the answers from fumbling through the code (Im the great code target market), but in an ideal situation, Id pair with devs and have them talk me through each portion of the code in plain wording. So if you can imagine scrolling through what youre documenting and saying aloud to someone less technical, This is where we do _______ with _________ because of _________ so that ________, then thats a good start.\n\nRemember that someone without your foundational knowledge or experience with your organization may be wandering across your doc years later after you go, so you cant assume that context that is obvious to you will be so to the future user.\n\nBreaking things down into smaller sections is a great way to build from scratch as well as being more readable. Bullet points, even/especially nesting ones, are also ones friends when documenting. Long paragraphs will cause folks to skim past more.\n\nProviding examples for things needing the user to input a string, one with the structure and one with an actual instance of input, is great, too. In terms of other examples, I try to consider the scenarios that clients are most likely to use and incorporate that.\n\nOutside of the feed X in to get Y type circumstances,  did you know factors may be nice to include, eg the file name structure of what will be output.\n\nIf something is getting too cumbersome to explain, it may help to reframe, say by setting up a table or diagram.\n\nScreenshot-wise, I often need to see the relevant parts of the program involved, or else the documentation feels somewhat meaningless and unmoored. I shouldnt need to ask myself, Wheres that button Im supposed to press? It should be described fully *and* shown to me. Theres an art to good screenshots:\n\n- hide unnecessary components, eg the ribbon if its not part of what needs to be shown\n\n- provide a big enough screenshot to show context so that its clear what part of the program is being used, or use text to explain the source\n\n- manually resize things as needed to cut down on useless white space that might stretch out the screenshot\n\n- fill in options as needed to share as much relevant information with the user as possible. For example, if the doc is about selecting settings, filling that whole dialog box out such that conditional menus will appear or settings youll talk about later are present is best.\n\n- focus on features of note when screenshotting, eg by strategically positioning the mouse over a specific button so it stands out, highlighting/selecting a certain line of code, getting a tooltip to appear, or simply annotating after the fact like by drawing a rectangle around the feature\n\nIf something like a dev tool is whats being documented, a description of a specific features options might be more relevant than a screenshot, though. I have to consult our third-party tool dev documentation sometimes, and its not always clear to me what a certain option means until I try it.\n\nSo basically, anticipate any follow-up questions when you write, break things down into smaller components, add relevant examples and descriptions (more than you might think you need), pick different methods of presentation if one isnt working, and include illuminating screenshots.",

If you're not sure what you want to do, just do Java. It's a shitty programming language that's good at almost everything.\n\nJava is awful. It's actually decently designed, but it's shitty at everything. If you don't know what to use, use python or javascript (or Typescript). Java shops turn prodigies into putzes. Java people do things like \"Dependency Injection\" and \"Calling dictionaries with dots in their keys 'trees.'\" Java is class-oriented. Python it object-oriented, they're very different. Javascript is python with a worse standard library and a faster runtime. Their data models are the same. Fite me.  Solid python/JS programmers are as common as java ones, and solid python/JS takes 1/3 as long to write and 1/10th as long to pivot. Different styles of usage synergize a lot better, so two python/JS devs who disagree on an implementation detail can work together much more easily.

I don't believe security is a distinctive skill separate from programming itself. If you're good enough of a programmer to understand what a SQL-injection attack is, and you know how to mitigate it, then you're good enough to call yourself a security expert. All security vulnerabilities are in the form of sending invalidated arbitrary input into some form of an `exec` function. The problem is that the security industry has done a very good job of convincing the masses that computer security is a massively complicated topic that only mega geniuses that spend 8 hours a day reading whitepapers can begin to understand.

I would never dispute that hiring is utterly broken in our industry, but there isnt much truth in the idea that the hiring process reflects much about your day to day working life. Companies that get lots of interest have ridiculously difficult interviews... AND its worth it to pass them, which is why people do it. \n\nThe more seniority you get the more attention you pay to (largely written) communication. You cant just write code, you have to convince people what code should be written and why. Then code.

      "Great post.    I'm 37+ years in the business and I agree with pretty much all of this.  \n\nA couple of last bullets\n\n- Knowing how regular expressions work and how to use them in editors and other tools can save you so much tedious work.   So can [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/tutorial/).\n\n- In addition to sql, learn bash.   Yeah, it's a squirrelly language but it does the job on that Linux platform that was in your bulleted list.  Plus, it's handy for use with  ~~Satan's build tools~~ Jenkins, Rundeck, and Docker. \n\n- Work for managers that have a life outside of work.   They tend to make the best managers.   People who have zero responsibilities outside of work have zero concept of life outside of work and zero compassion for those who are responsible for children, elderly parents or pets larger than a parakeet.\n\n- Age discrimination in IT is real.    Be prepared for it by continuing to learn and update your skills, especially soft skills like writing, presenting and mentoring.   Also, see those devops comments above.  And, cloud skills are pretty hot now.   If you are 40 and your only real skill is understanding how a LEFT JOIN works, you're asking for trouble.\n \n- getting to the \"Not giving a fuck about your career aspirations anymore\" part of your IT career is awesome.   \n\n....and yeah, I wish there were more of us women in the biz.",

      "Ill add to this a little (30 years experience, 22 years with 5 different Fortune 500 companies)\n- No matter what you do, at the end of the day IT is always viewed as an expense.  \n- You have to constantly keep re-training yourself on new technologies if you want to stay employed.  Dont expect companies to keep your skills up to date.  Its your responsibility.\n- HR is not your friend.  Unless its something serious like sexual harassment, dont talk to them.\n- Socialize with your coworkers.  Share salary details.  Understand your companies salary structure.  Know your worth.  If they dont want to pay you, someone else will.\n- You are selling minutes of your life for a paycheck.  Dont work more than you have too or need to.\n- Good bosses are damn near impossible to find.\n- Switching jobs because you have to work with incompetent people isnt a good idea.  Every company has incompetent people, when you switch jobs it just takes 4-6 weeks to figure out who they are.\n- Switching jobs isnt frowned upon.  HR and managers want you to believe this to fool you into staying longer than you should.  Switch jobs every 5-7 years.  Its a great way to grab more cash and learn something new.  When you join a new company a lot of time its because managers want to pick your brain on best practices youve picked up in your prior experience.\n- Certifications and advanced degrees will help you stand out and help you advance your career.  Take advantage of your companies tuition reimbursement program.  Get your MBA.\n- Always keep your resume up to date\n- Companies are always monitoring you.  They log your phone calls, text messages, emails, and browser sessions.  They see what you post on social media, they see what files you send via webmail.  They randomly take screen shots of your screen and log them.  Managers dont have enough time to read through all the info that they have on you.

The number is closer to 15+ when considering those who are still debating staying in. Are you all seeing something similar where you all are at?

Then there's the fact that for people like me who have only been doing this for the last decade this is probably the first major shrink with pay freezes & perk cutbacks being common (not to ignore the fact that we typically get paid well, but still).\n\n3. For me personally it's also just the realisation that I'll always be held accountable for issues outside of my control. Someone in sales can just sign off a deal without my input for a third party framework that I then have to maintain and figure out workarounds when the framework fucks up.\n\n4. The \"year of efficiency\". So you've lost many of your perks etc and then you lose half your team, too.

I've never been able to see agile as anything other than a game for managers to do/produce as little as they can possibly get away with. I feel it takes a team an entire year to do half of what people could do in 3 months 10 years ago.

The company invented a lower performance bracket and stuck me in it, but the high performers were all bitching about their comp anyway.

It's no wonder people are leaving the field.",

Initially, many of us loved to program, but software engineering is a completely different beast. The industry is full of bullshit, and the businesses arent concerned about the quality that much anymore, but rather about other metrics. The market has adjusted to be driven by average engineers (simply because there is a higher supply of them), so the more skilled you are, the fewer opportunities for growth you see, the less your expertise is actually required, and you can be substituted with someone who costs less. Of course you always have more skills, but many jobs on the market dont need that level of expertise these days. I know thats not entirely true but thats how some of my colleagues feel.",
      "Just curious what careers are they switching to?\n\nFor me, I love building software but the arbitrary deadlines teams will never hit and all the politics in the work place make it a miserable career with constant pressure to get more done faster while trying to stay up to date with fast changing technology.",
      "i dont really see any serious initiative on the part of companies to try and make developer well being the number one priority. i was burned out and quit my last job and im in a coding retreat currently where a lot of people feel pretty burned out too. i think most people ive spoken to here are feeling that way. it saddens me to think that this might not be a sustainable career. It also saddens me to see that a lot of this is due to how everything is structured, where we ultimately dont really have any say in our working conditions. The only advice i ever see when someone is at a toxic workplace is \"you need to quit and find a new job\", but thats completely short sighted. We cant all job hop and expect the industry to change. I think dev's need to take more ownership of the culture at the places they work at, and really push for consistent improvements. Im not sure of any other way out of this cycle, yet im not seeing dev's take this on seriously as their daily responsibility",
      "5 YoE dev here and I'm feeling the burnout pretty bad.",
      "I think there are multiple factors:\n\n* For the decade before interest rates spiked, the economy slowed, and layoffs started to hit in 2022-ish, developers were in ridiculously high demand, and it was a great feeling. You could be fairly confident that you would be listened to and given opportunities to level up. When that changed, we all had to come to grips with more conservative expectations. In some cases, you have to work hard just to keep what you have, rather than get ahead. That can be a hard pill to swallow.\n* Company culture is getting a lot more somber overall. Focus tends to me more on cost savings than on moonshots or new growth. People are more cynical.\n* In some companies, there is a flattening where there are fewer managers and bigger teams. You can feel a lot less like you have a voice in that context. Likewise, it can burn out managers (that's what happened to me).\n\nI think we had it really good as a career for quite a long time (since like 2010 really, riding the mobile app wave and all the resulting service companies). Now, we're slowing down. Tech will pick up steam again, once we find our next rocket ship. Maybe it's already gestating. Or maybe what we had was just unsustainable and we're getting closer to a realistic career.",

I parlayed that into several high paying consulting opportunities. Currently finding a niche in AI. This industry requires constant reinvention. \n\nI have lamented several times that a doctor only has to learn the human body once and they're a doctor for life. Programmers have to relearn their craft every 5-10 years. \n\nWe have no unions or governing body like doctors, lawyers, dentists, vets, etc.  and that makes the barrier to entry very low and there is no rate protection. Pay is constantly falling and it's an uphill battle to keep making the big bucks.  \n\nStill enjoy it though and AI is saving me from writing a lot of boilerplate these days!",

I got a new gig and had my benefits cut on my 3rd day. Wasnt even out of onboarding.\n\nThe last round of layoffs definitely convinced me to pursue a career change.",

      "I dont mean for this to sound awful or zoomers are the issue but here we go:\n\nI think there is a lot of title inflation at lower levels. I personally work with 3 engineers with 4.5 - 6 years of experience who are all senior. They all were promoted to said level at 2.5 years of experience. The issue is that none of them operate at a senior level, which means it is all on me to handle any issue that comes up. I cannot depend on them to complete tickets on their own, or own on call (I am contacted if anything remotely challenging comes up). \n\nOver the past few years, all responsibility has been transferred to people at my level (Senior II/Staff I). It is tiring to work on a team with people who cant own their own tickets or minor features. They cant be depended on to do something on their own. Every issue needs to involve me (or someone at my level). \n\nI also work with some young people who are phenomenal and really rise to the level, but we set such a low bar for people that some realize that it is better to not put effort in that to do so and get a 3% bonus and the same raise as everyone else. This isnt a generational thing but rather an issue with managers growing their empire and refusing to hold standards. I also think that part of this empire building has taught younger engineers to play the bureaucracy game. I am amazed how often a 27 year old engineer will bring up points, involving an engineering design, like we arent using the new standard company font here or can you make sure to link this doc in another doc. I rarely get engineering feedback, just formatting feedback. I dont work with dumb people, they are actually very smart, so smart that they optimized their learning for what gets them ahead. Sadly that isnt engineering.",
      "I've been in the industry for 26 years now, and I've gone through lots of ups and downs. Feeling good and then being burned out later, and then I find a new spark or challenge to get me interested in doing things again. I think burn out exists in EVERY occupation and is a result of the human condition more than the industry. But you can also contribute some of the burnout to the huge push to get more people into technology over the last couple decades, and people ran out and did a couple bootcamps, applied to jobs that others were better qualified for, and then realized they aren't in bootcamp anymore, and things aren't as clean room laboratory as their class. Now they are facing the real challenges and because they don't have the knowledge to systematically approach a problem and break it down into steps and pieces, they get overwhelmed and that is a surefire way to get burned out. I get burned out when I get bored because I'm not challenged anymore, I do it because I love the satisfaction of solving problems that others can't. I have a lot of the qualities that make a good programmer. Attention to detail, perfectionism, curiosity, great trouble shooting skills, being able to view the whole project in my mind at once and see how the pieces fit. Some of those aren't learned, they are innate to your personality and approach to life.",
      "It is the same with every industry everywhere at the moment. Trying not to sound overly-dramatic but I've been saying the last few years since COVID, we are in the capitalism endgame unless something drastically changes. \n\nAll most public companies have given up any semblance of chasing anything else other than the all-mighty share price. This was fine when it started in the 80s and 90s where companies genuinely did have inefficiencies and emerging technologies (computers and automation) could make a significant change to a company's ability to grow and profit. \n\nBut finally, through the 2020s we've gotten to the point where companies have become (more) efficient, costs are going up (because of those pesky humans they employ) and so profits are already close to maximized. But Wall Street demands more, so we start cutting corners. Let's bring in this new CEO (or listen to our board) who says they can work wonders and bring us into a new age. More profit!\n \nAs CEO, I start increasing prices and reducing product manufacturing footprint (candy/chocolate bars getting smaller, etc.) where I can. Maybe I can actually genuinely effectively eliminate some real inefficient practices. Great! That elevates profits for a quarter or a year, but it doesn't stay exciting for long. \n\nOk, let's start eliminating 'fluff' positions. Now, enough of the old guard is still employed by the company at this point that the decision is made to not eliminate positions outright, but to outsource instead. Outsourcing on paper looks brilliant (and often can be) - the outsourcing is cheaper than hiring outright. I don't need to manage these people (I can reduce HR), and I can get rid of all of these pesky old timers with their opinions and pensions. \n\nNow the company looks great (on paper)! I've saved and eliminated a ton of internal bullshit waste (on paper) and my business is now in the record profit territory (on paper). Now, I've started to get some rumors from under the troll bridge that client complaints are up and quality appears to be slipping. Offshore development has brought with it some inefficiencies I didn't account for and I've noticed that over time, our ability to QA/QC and manage the offshore teams has slipped as frankly, we don't have enough technical staff left to understand and manage anymore (that expensive lead dev layer was the first to go - opinionated fucks). But you know what? I don't care; I won Wall Street, mic drop, I as CEO bow out a rich legend and move on to do the same thing elsewhere. Nobody ever measures me against my long term effects - yay!\n\nAnd that is IF your company wasn't bought by a competitor or invested in by venture capatilists - if it was, picture the above with a lot more rollercoaster rides of bullshit stock options, golden handcuffs, etc. while you are shuttled around, your buddies 'retired' and any semblance of a 'core' team dismantled. And those golden handcuffs that keep you locked in? They sure as shit ain't putting those same restrictions on that CEO.\n\nAnd I think this is the state we are currently at - where tech companies are so desperate to make the almighty wall street sing, we are entering new business models that previously would have been considered unprofitable or pointless and while they chase some form of profitability, the \"employees\" are the worst expense, never the valued ones - I could call out the entire gig economy here... Hmmm, how can I upset an industry to extract profit from it while paying people as little as is humanly possible knowing that the folks who have been in that industry for years will end up getting 'reset' to the new baseline I've caused when I'm through? Hold my pint...\n\nFor those wondering, I'm not against the rise of the gig-economy, it's good to see established, potentially unhealthy industries get realigned - I mean who wasn't happy initially to see taxi competition with Uber and the like? The issue is, by he time the US likes to regulate anything, the damage is already done and the new pattern for the industry has been established - always towards the interests of the companies, not the employees in that industry. \n\nFor anyone reading this, this is extremely tongue-in-cheek as I sit here nursing a cup of tea. I'm  seeing a lot of things that I just don't like about the way we humans allow ourselves to conduct business. While this is a gross oversimplification and ignores so many other factors, but there's just not enough morals and conviction to providing quality service and/or product in the American system. I.e. you can profit and still value your employees and customers. You just might not grow as fast as the market demands - why has that become a barometer of 'failure' for the US economy? It's a lose lose.",

Bad things developers talk about from their personal experience stick out and we remember things that stick out. \n\nThe list of developers we know who have (burned out|been laid off|left the profession|died) only gets longer, never gets shorter. \n\nI skipped the question: \\_maybe\\_ more developers are burning out. I could believe it. I think in the US at least, we're more aware of mental health and have a sense that it's worse than it used to be. But I definitely believe that you know more developers who have burned out.\n\nGood news is age and experience improves our ability to notice and address it in others. We get to be a part of making someone else's world better instead of worse.",

      "That's a trend that has been developing since the mid-1990s, thanks to leadership that:\n\n- Considers non-technical managers qualified to effectively direct technical teams.\n\n- Rejects the concept of domain knowledge and treats devs as plug-compatible units that can be swapped in and out of complex projects at will without affecting overall productivity.\n\n- Blindly embraces every trendy methodology without consulting with the people upon which they're imposing it; what we used to call \"IT magazine managers.\"\n\n25 yoe; thoroughly burnt out, mostly from the above; considering career change or early retirement.",
      "Working in an office made it possible for managers to follow up on developers who were getting burned out before they got too bad. It also guaranteed that all employees got some social needs covered - even when going through divorce or other issues at home.\n\nIt is easy to say that people should be able to just be social outside of work, but many don't. Often because they have family that requires attention after school and working hours. \n\nI'm mostly remote now and it works great for me, but I work on a team where half the developers are \"tapped out\". \n\nIt is what it is I guess. Maybe the people who cannot handle remote work simply needs to be weeded out. That way the rest of us can enjoy our comfy home office lives. \n\nMaybe all of us have phases in our career where we truly need the social aspect of office work.

The pace of change. The fact that some work on systems that are irredeemable. The fact that theres often pressure to deliver that leads to substandard work. The fact that substandard work is even something that - as an industry - we contemplate, let alone follow through with.\n\nSoftware developers have, for numerous reasons Im sure, failed to earn the trust that is accorded to professional engineers, doctors, and lawyers.\n\nLarge swathes of employers are at least mildly distrustful or suspicious of software developers.

      "Be ready to need to trust more and directly do less. It's all about setting things in motion and keeping the runway clear, then seeing how things play out. You can't solve things by just working hard personally.\n\n\nYou need to be the PR guy for whatever group you represent. Broadcast their successes. Their success is your success.\n\n\nBe pro active. You're the one responsible for keeping an eye to the future.\n\n\nFocus on QOL and WLB. Happy and rested engineers are productive ones. Devs get on average 4-6h of real work done per day, regardless of how long they're actually at the office. Your big job is ensuring they achieve maximum productivity in that time.\n\n\nThat goes for you too. You have to work EXTRA hard to guard your time and set a good example. The beast is hungry and will ALWAYS want more from you and your team. Team level leadership is in aa unique place of being the only ones who both know the situation on the ground AND the strategic situation for the company. You're really the only one who can control the flow of work.\n\n\nSo if there's more work to do than you can get done in 40h...you have to be brave enough to leave it undone and communicate what's happening to leadership. DON'T just put in extra time or demand extra hours from your team to try and hide the problem. It just doesn't pay off over time.\n\n\n\nYou're in the middle when it comes to communication. You keep the team informed about the state of the company, and the company informed about the state of the team. How good you are at communication is one of the biggest impacts on the perception of your, and your teams success.\n\n\nShield your team. Protect them from meetings, blame, demands, and shifting. Give them as much transparency as you can.\n\n\nDelegate aggressively. You're responsible for making sure things get done, but not necessarily for DOING them. You don't have to run every meeting, prepare every report, or head every initiative. And the more you spread the work the more your team members will grow and learn to self manage.\n\n\n\nThough when it comes to technical work, try and delegate responsibilities, not tasks. You want team members to pull in tasks rather that wait to be directed. You want your teams to self organize and self manage as much as possible.\n\n\nStart with trust, don't require team members to earn it. Assume they're competent, hard working, and dedicated and then deal with it if they violate that trust. The whole thing only works if you can trust people anyways. So start there and then get rid of them if they can't be trusted.\n\n\nUnderstand that everyone works and thinks different and embrace that.\n\n\n\nFinally, and this might be a bit controversial, but it's worked really well for me and the team leads I've mentored. I like to encourage unmasking and transparency on my teams. I tell them I know we all have off days and even weeks where we get distracted by YouTube, or some hobby, or our brains just WILL NOT get traction on a task. Lots of devs have multiple slow days and make up for it with big productivity pushes on their good days.\n\n\nThat's all ok...as long as they will be transparent. A team lead can manage around that. Pairing, swarming, and body doubling is all very effective. Tasks can be reassigned, or deadlines renegotiated. But we can only do that if everyone feels comfortable being honest.\n\n\nThat's what stand up is really for, in my mind . Not reporting progress, just planning how to move forward every day. Team members checking with each other to see if there are any issues they can help each other with, and making a plan for the day. I highly encourage teams to stop doing round robin style and instead just walk through the current tasks.\n\n\nI'll cut it off there, as obviously I'm getting a bit wordy. :) Hope there's something of value there for you.",

    "content": "Hi everyone,\n\n**TL:DR: Based on the 5 experiences below, should I change teams, companies, careers, or stay put. Sorry for the long post. (if I should take it down, just let me know)**\n\nSo, I was really hoping to get some advice here. I've been a developer for quite some time, and it has been something of a rollercoaster ride for me. There may be some underlying issues that I've been ignoring, but I was hoping that maybe you guys could help me identify those. My career thus far has been both good and bad, but even in school, it was the same.\n\nThe goal of this post isn't to bash my previous teams, but I truly wonder if anyone has had this much fluctuation in their career path as an engineer. Sometimes, I wonder if this is actually a common occurrence in software development careers, or if this is just a team/company issue. More so now than ever, I've considered switching careers, because it truly seems like it will be a constant.\n\nI've presented 5 distinct experiences so far just so you'd have context. \n\nI would really appreciate anyone's advice, feedback, or guidance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**College:**\n\nSo, in college, I was a Mathematics major. I grew up loving math, and I loved all that you could do with it. However, I learned very quickly that once we got to the proof-based courses (all the others were fine), it was as it I just couldn't think in the same language as my professors. I didn't do very well, but I managed to get by. I also picked up a minor in Computer Science, which was fun with the exception of the OS-level courses. I simply loved how creative I could be with it. So, I pursued a career in software engineering.\n\n**First Job:**\n\nMy first job as a software engineer was both good and bad. I got creative projects and I got to make changes that people around the world could see. I was 100% the \"UI-guy\" at this point, because our previous UI specialist had left the company. I had a role, and it was great. I could be creative at work, and help millions of people. Eventually, we had a re-org, and this put me on a new team, where UI work was not at all something they cared about. More often than not, I found myself in situations where I was asked \"why don't you know this?\" or \"why do you keep looking up how to do things instead of memorizing them?\" This was usually in reference to OS-based things. I tried my best to be useful in every other way I could be, including going through our customers feedback and identifying how we could make our product more useful. I was then presented with the statement, \"sometimes, even if we know we can do something to improve the customer's experience, we simply don't because it means they will pay for our service longer waiting for it.\" I'm not sure why, but this statement bothered me so much, so I left for a new job.\n\n **Second Job:**\n\nMy second job was as a SRE/DevOps Engineer. It seemed like a great opportunity since I could essentially help both the company and the people with it. I could be creative and build tools that hopefully, would benefit everyone. However, while I got to program/code to some degree, most of my job was watching dashboards and rerouting phone calls. Eventually, some of the team took to watching movies or playing video games all shift (and in some cases, bring in their drones) whenever the manager wasn't there due to the sheer amount of down time they had. I quickly watched my team grow in frustration with the way the team was managed, and over my time there, 75% of my team had either left or had been fired (largely due to growing disgruntlement with the way things were). My manager frequently skipped my 1 on 1's with him and eventually, it came to a point where I'd only see him at bi-monthly intervals. I become something of a heads down programmer on the team, building random project and random project, hoping that eventually, someone would pick something up. Finally, I realized no one would, because I was the only one who could code and was willing to. I don't know if my code was good or bad. I just knew everyone was disinterested. So, I tried to move back to a software development team.\n\n**Third Job:**\n\nMy third job was something of a relief for me. I got to develop for a customer facing set of services, and I truly don't think I've ever been so happy for an extended period of time working in my life. There were always things to learn, always ideas to be discussed. and always opportunity for improvement. I think 90% of what I learned as a developer today, was through that team. I did everything I could for the team, and ultimately got a promotion for it. That said, it didn't matter that I got a promotion, because I simply loved the job. Additionally, it was through this job I realized the importance of negotiation of your salary. Mine had been so far off the mark that my team/manager grew concerned for me and fixed it (this was a huge fix). For the first time ever, I felt like I was in a place where I cared about the work, and my team cared about my input. I even led a few projects here and there as well. I truly envisioned staying with the company forever, and potentially becoming an engineering manager at some point because of it. The sheer amount of support I received was phenomenal. However, when COVID-19 hit, of course this shook things up a bit, leading to another re-org.\n\n**Fourth Job:**\n\nFor the first time, even though this was my second re-org, I often wondered why I was placed were I was. I often asked why at this point. Before my official start on my new team, I learned that I would be joining a failing, politically-corrupt team; that the current members of the team refused to teach, learn, or share any new information, because with doing so, it meant their jobs would be in jeopardy of being taken by younger developers. This was a team the entire company needed, but seemed to hate working with. I don't think I truly understood this at the time. That said, I learned why I was put on the team. I learned that I was put on the team solely because I was a DevOps Engineer in the past (work that I grew to hate by this point). The entire goal was to get people together to transform this team, despite expecting some of the other engineers there to push bad. Our tech stack was incredibly old, and the previous team members where clearly specialists. No one was willing to learn anything new. Only the newer members tried. This team was so under water, that asking anyone for help seemed like a huge burden on them. That said, what we heard, was in fact the case. The team eventually was split down the middle as ops and automation. Eventually, the team functioned as separate parts. It eventually became all about systems design and pushing for ideas that we could never get an unanimous decision on (almost always 50/50). Eventually, I had stopped coding entirely, and a bulk of my job had become manual labor (yes, turning devices on and off). I have been a \"software engineer\" for several months on this team, but I've never felt so distant from it. So, as you'd expect, I decided to leave to a more development centric team.\n\n**Today:**\n\nI am posting this because I genuinely want some advice on how to proceed.",

If youre lucky enough to be working at a company where software *is* the product, this still doesnt magically exempt you from corporate politics (which you experienced in the 50/50 deadlocks).

In your 1:1 with your manager you need to make it clear that you want growth opportunities. Ask them for help in approaching a senior developer/tech lead on your team to get exposure to higher-level tasks like assisting in designing something.

    "title": "The tech industry currently favors specialized engineers over generalists.",
    "content": "From the perspective of a mid/senior engineer who has spent the last 4-5 years as a full-stack generalist, I'm realizing that the tech industry currently favors specialists. And why wouldn't it? Why would someone hire a top-tier React dev when their company is looking for a Java dev and there are dozens of top-tier Java devs in the interview loop? I think this is happening because of the layoffs, and I don't know how soon it will recover. Perhaps specializing will be very important until 2025 or even 2026.\n\nHere's my hot take: A lot of generalist engineers always come to these threads and say that being a generalist is great. But a lot of these generalists succeeded in the biggest tech bull market. So I feel like these takes have \"survivorship bias\". Kinda like hearing \"I made a successful career as a generalist and I've seen lots of successful generalist engineers so you should do the same\". Maybe this advice worked from the 2010s - the 2020s, but it just isn't useful anymore. Specializing in a specific field (be it frontend, backend, mobile, systems, ai/ml, data engineering, ar/vr, etc.) is very important for getting those interviews.\n\nSpecialization is also happening with FAANG companies now. This didn't exist before because there were more generic interview loops.  All you had to do was LeetCode. But now, that's changed. Google does a team match before the final round. So you only get an interview after a hiring manager already screened your resume. And if the HM is looking for SRE, but you have React.js experience, you probably won't get a callback. Facebook also has specific interview loops based on the role (frontend, backend, mobile, SRE, ar/vr, systems) you are applying for.\n\nI wish it weren't the case but this is just what I've observed. Thank you for coming to my ted talk. Would love to hear thoughts about this from other experienced engineers. Is the tech market shifting, or am I just way off base here?\n\nEDIT:\n\nFound a comment that describes what I mean by specializing.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/12sipub/comment/jgzi6u3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n\nI've copied the full comment here:\n\n\"I think it's naive to think that experience in a certain ecosystem doesn't matter. It's not about languages, but a lot of people (mostly on Reddit) try to pretend it is. \n\n[Note: When I said \"top-tier React dev\", I was referring to someone who understands the entire frontend JS ecosystem including TypeScript, State Management, Rest/GraphQL APIs, NodeJS, NPM, etc. I did not mean someone who only knows React. IMO, you can't be a \"top-tier React dev\" if you don't know the technologies/frameworks/tooling related to it.]\n\nI'm a \"Java developer\" but there are actually 3 components:\n\n- The language: not relevant. What I know about Java you can probably pick up 90% in a few weeks. Heck; I work mostly in Kotlin nowadays.\n\n- The tooling, libraries and frameworks: massively relevant. 15 years of working with Spring for instance isn't something you make up in a year.\n\n- The type of software I build: massively relevant. There is a huge difference between the type of things a back-end dev builds compared to front-end and embedded. And even within back-end the type of work I do is generally different from what a wordpress developer does.\n\nI'm sure it's a tough pill to swallow for a lot of people, but there is a reason so many companies want applications to be a close match to what they currently need. The larger the distance the higher the risk that you won't be productive before you eventually leave.\n\nThere is an experience bias in Reddit where a lot of people have mostly experience with junior roles. No one is going to want a new grad to have stack specific experience because it's not relevant. But for a very senior IC who's expected to explain to others how things work, them not having that actual experience means they won't be able to fill that role for an extensive amount of time.\"",

      "The best generalists Ive worked with in the past are great at becoming a specialist (to a certain extent) or learning enough to fundamentally understand a concept in a particular area very quickly. Once they switch to the next thing theyve probably offloaded a lot of the minutiae out of the cache, but they can recall it and build the context again pretty damn fast.\n\nVery different than a jack-of-all-trades but master of none, but again theres a whole spectrum here.",
      "25yoe. This comes and goes. During lean times companies narrow their focus and their candidates. During boom times they want all-rounders because they know different stuff comes down the pipe.  \n   \nAfter the dot com bust if you put in frontend and backend skills the hiring managers who get confused \"so what are you then? Frontend or backend?\" The perception back then when pretty much everybody was a noob was that you couldn't possibly be good at both.   \n   \nDuring the social media boom of 2006-2009 you HAD to be full stack.  \n   \nI see the same happening in this latest boom/bust cycle. Once budgets open back up they will go back to generalists. You just basically have to have a different resume for different roles is all.  \n   \nThe truth of the matter is that we are all temporary specialists. As a dev, your job is to learn, not code.  I expect in 5 years there will be another disruptive technology, and some things that people cling onto (react, spring, pyspark) will be outmoded. I can always tell by how over-zealous the users are. You want to be a good software engineer, not a good framework engineer.",
      "Smaller companies seem to want a full stack that can do everything.   \n\n\nThe market just sucks at the moment doesn't matter what your background is. Until interest rates return to earth we are all in a most unfortunate situation regardless of specialization.",
      "The tech sector of the tech industry seems to- as you said, with FAANG. But the tech industry as a whole is stilled varied. Go apply in Fintech, insurance, government subcontracting, etc and you'll find lots of postings for generalists, because those companies simply don't want to pay for specialists. They want to pay 1 person less money than a specialist would cost, and expect them to do everything. That's generally how non-tech companies with tech departments tend to lean.\n\nBut places like Google, IBM, Apple, etc? Oh yea, they seem to love their specialists.",
      "My perfect engineer is an exceptional problem solver. Doing the work is the easy part. Being able to debug issues effectively and plan features is much more valuable to the team than being a specialist that can't be useful outside of their realm. \n\nIt's fine to have a focus that you prefer or are more comfortable in, but in my eyes it's more important to be able to grok the entire flow and contribute accordingly.",
      "Startups and small shops are still looking for full stack guys. Also on the other end of the coin you can specialize and get really good at something and then find that there are hardly any roles that need your exact specialization. Just strive to be excellent and you'll be fine",

      "This is a weird discussion because most of the things we're calling \"specializations\" really aren't IMO. Like, someone who works on 3d rendering software and needs to know a ton of complicated linear algebra, that I consider a specialization.  Or someone who's an expert in database engines who knows all the ins and outs of different indexing algorithms.\n\nI just don't put things like knowing a UI framework on that level. I'm a generalist engineer, but if someone really wants me to interview for a react role then I'll spend a couple weeks studying up on all the little react edge cases and details I'm fuzzy on and take the interview. It's not like we're talking about stuff you need to go back to school for here",
      "Strongly disagree. I've primarily worked for small startups, and for us we want generalists way more than specialists.\n\nYou seem to be referring more to larger companies, and idk what they want. I thought big tech just wanted Leetcode interview prep monkeys for general software engineering roles.",

      "When is the last time you've realistically seen a company hire just a Software Engineer?  A true generalist.  The 1970s.  Maybe the 1980s.  By the time of the 1990s you hired web devs, a specialist.  A full stack software engineer is a kind of specialist.\n\nA friend of mine has been in Silicon Valley so long his job title for his jobs was Engineer.  That's it, just Engineer. You ask him to build it, he builds in.  It's that simple.  Need something physical?  He'll build the board, write the code, and make the cover for it doing the mechanical engineering parts too.  Need an app?  He's on it.  \n\nI want to go back in time and have my job title be just Scientist.  That would be badass.   XD",
      "I see the opposite, I see a lot of specialized folks especially front end that are confused why they arent getting jobs.",
      "Yeah, it sucks being a generalist these days. Everyone just wants someone who knows one thing really well. Like what am I supposed to do with all this jack of all trades experience? Guess that's why I keep getting rejected for interviews. Maybe time to rethink my career strategy or something...ugh.",

      ">From the perspective of a mid/senior engineer who has spent the last 5 years as a full-stack generalist, I'm realizing that the tech industry currently favors specialists. And why wouldn't it? Why would someone hire a top-tier React dev when their company is looking for a Java dev and there are dozens of top-tier Java devs in the interview loop?\n\nFrom the perspective of a senior engineer with 29 years experience in the industry in both the UK and the US and have also interviewed many potential candidates over the years, from my experience the industry has always been like this and has always preferred making an offer to a developer that has the *closest match* of skills needed for an open role if there are multiple candidates available.\n\nOnly in cases where there hasn't been a best match have alternatives been considered, where e.g. someone has experience with framework x but not the required framework y but were offered the role because it's likely they can pick up y on the job. From a business point of view, why wouldn't you prefer to take a closer or exact experience match than someone who doesn't have the exact experience required? It's the lower risk option and potentially lower cost if the candidate hits the ground running with less time to ramp up.\n\nWhat I can say from experience over the past 30 years is that it did used to be more common that a company would take on a new entry level developer and offer to train on the job. In the last 10 years, maybe longer, there's been a definite shift to requiring x years of previous experience.\n\nYour experience will vary though, the recruiting preferences and strategies differ wildly from company to company depending on many criteria - small team vs large team, new team vs established/experienced team, startup vs established company etc.",
      "I think that's too broad of a generalization. I've been a full-stack engineer for 25 years in the US, and I've always been valuable. I'm not a \"generalist\" per se - I work very hard to have depth in a particular stack, at any given time. That's harder today than ever obviously, but certainly not impossible.\n\nIt's fair to say that certain roles favor specialization and others favor someone with a broader range of experience. As I've moved up in seniority and leadership, the broader the skill-set, the better. If you want to be a architect/lead/director where you're calling the shots but still in the code, generalization is a better place to be.\n\nI can't picture \\*not\\* being a full-stack dev. I don't encourage younger devs to specialize...partly because they may not their strengths yet and also, it's good for younger devs to realize the entire world before them. I see a lot of stuff going into React applications now, with React specialists never knowing much about the rest of the stack. A lot of bad decisions are made and a lot of things happen in the front-end that shouldn't, IME. Likewise, if you sit in APIs all day and don't consider the impact of your decisions on the rest of the stack, it can result in design problems that could have been avoided.",
      "I dont dislike the engineers on my teams who specialize, but I dislike having specialized engineers. Being bottlenecked at releasing features because 1 or 2 engineers only do front end is a pain, and I have to come in and superhero the rest of the backend work just to get the thing to ship is a PITA.",

      "What I have found as a generalist game engineer that recently went through the interview game is that generalization is a specialization.  Some companies want or need one for the particular role they are filling.  However, if they need someone who has spent all their time on some particular area, they will beat out that person.\n\nSo I think there is a grain of truth here... it's just that generalist at the moment have about as much chance as a specialist, whereas in the past, a generalist also had a chance of getting a specialist role.",
      "its always been this way. its also dangerous. specializations come and go. so when yours goes away its harder to switch.",
      "I agree generally. I just concluded a job search as a frontend dev. Most places wanted fullstack - a particular full stack. There is not a lot of interest from employers in the idea that dev skills are transferrable to some degree between languages, tools, etc. I.E. I'm sure I'd be fine with react after a few months ramp up, but I only have experience with Angular.",

I said I was 80/20 back/front, but didn't specify their desired ratio in the rejection letter.\n\nThe one job I've progressed through the interview stages has a salary cap (listed) less than my last two FTE jobs (currently freelance).\n\nGood luck everyone",

      "I dunno, this is kind of how it's always been.  I was more full stack in my younger days but as I got more experienced I ended up moving into the thing I had more experience with (Backend Dev).  I still understand frontend work fairly well, but some of the specifics that have cropped up in the last few years (a lot of the state management systems) on frontend are things Im less knowledgeable about and lean on frontend folks for it.\n\nReality is generalists are more glue folks.  Folks will end up leaning towards backend or frontend people for backend or frontend issues.  It's hard to get the depth those folks do as a full stack unless you are effectively moving towards becoming a specialist.  I noticed when I was more of a generalist I wouldn't have as much knowledge or \"ammo\" in technical discussions where there is a specific area of focus. My usefulness would normally be higher level (arch and how different groups/components would interact and any flaws with how those interactions and boundaries were setup).\n\nMy general knowledge has definitely been more useful as I've moved up to a higher level though.\n\nFeel like career wise building up a broad knowledge base in my youth was helpful from both finding out what I liked/was good at and keeping my technically nimble.  I pull on knowledge/experience from there even if my focus is more backend.  At staff level where you're leading/kicking off some projects around a few teams, mentoring folks, guiding things and plugging gaps in your org that broad knowledge-base becomes very useful.",
      "FAANG hard-line generalist here. *Hiring* always has and always will favor specialists. *Performance reviews* typically favor generalists. \n\nThat's why networking is so critical for generalists. As a generalist I do very well in my org (consulting), and if I did somehow get laid off or decide to leave I've built enough high quality connections to be able to walk into a half dozen top tier companies and get hired on the spot based solely on those companies' past experience working with me as an external contractor. But if I had to resort to cold-submitting resumes, I'd be *fucked*. \n\nThis has less to do with what skillset is actually needed or desired, and a lot more to do with what methods can be easily used to bulk-filter resumes. 5 years experience in product X is a simple boolean checkbox that can be easily checked by a recruiter or even automated. 6 weeks experience in goddamn everything is very hard to express coherently on a resume, and even harder to accurately screen for, so most companies don't bother and stick to the simple criteria they can cheaply and quickly evaluate.",

If that technology is ever superseded or replaced, youre useless.\n\nGeneralization has as much ceiling as the scale of the industry itself.

      "Specialization is definitely trending in 2024-2025. Especially with the way the job market looks with the influx in the use of AI. Generalist and specialist are not the only options. There are hybrid skill sets that can set you up for success. Having a T-shaped or Pi-shaped skill set means you're highly skilled in one or more areas but still have a solid grasp on other technologies. This gives you flexibility. You're the go-to expert in your field. And you can also collaborate across teams and tackle a variety of challenges.\n\nIn my 20-year career, a Comb-shaped skill set has been my approach. I've honed expertise in certain areas, like cloud technologies, DevOps, developer experience, and team leadership. But I keep a broad range of skills in my toolbox. It's helped me solve a wide array of problems and adapt to different types of projects and team dynamics. I've done this in both startups and larger organizations. Being versatile, learning new skills when necessary, has afforded me my success as a software engineer.\n\nThe most successful professionals view their careers as continuous learning opportunities. And at the end of the day, you want to find a balance that aligns with your career goals.

      "You are overthinking and experiencing a confirmation bias. This is a discussion where I don't know where to start. But let me start with confirming your bias and some food for thought :)\n\nWhen the technology evolves, user expectations increase, and so companies expectations for that particular skill tend to rise. I would have valued a front end engineer with basic css/html skill a lot higher 5 yrs back than I do now. Now, I expect every engineer to build a basic ui. And front end engineers, I expect them to improve that last bit of page performance I can improve, which you'll be able to do quickly if you had been investing that much time to know the deep knowledge through your xp and keep up with the latest developments. If you didn't, then it will take you more time.\n\nI wouldn't completely deny your observation (special over general) but that is a moot point imo when it comes to think about career. You always specialize over time.\n\nAnd this has nothing to do with the economy, but with the technology evolution. There are all sorts of projects companies are doing which require everything - specialized, full stack, and everything in between. \n\nWith experience, you end up specializing in few things over others. At 5 yrs xp, you should start looking into what is that specialization that will be relevant for at least few years.\n\nThe bottom line is\n\n### **Just be the top 1% of whatever domain you pick. Being top 1% of a niche is easier than being a top generalist.**\n\nAnd this is the best advice that can come out of this discussion for an experienced engineer",
      "I can only speak for myself but I want the smartest person I can find and I'll hire a smarter person that's thinking on their feet over the person who memorized everything. However, from the start I was looking for something specific to add to my team (React FE, Java BE, DB2, etc...). The company doesn't want to hire a java dev to fill a React position and wait a year or more for that dev to become an effective teammate. My team won't put up with it either as it would cause a distraction and lower morale.\n\nIt's important to generalize in a breadth of knowledge surrounding what you do but you should really dive deep into something to become an asset to your team because I'm going to pick the least useful person on my team when I'm asked who we can let go.\n\nAlso, that person who never really improves or pushes themselves to do better becomes a liability.

Each place Ive stopped that has been a new stack, new frameworks and languages, new way of doing things. Ive been able to adapt to those fairly quickly.\n\nBut Ive also specialized in build tooling and devx as a secondary skill throughout my career. At every point, inevitably I become the guy who debugs my teammates dev environment and does all the build tooling and CI improvements. At my first job as a junior I was kind of forced into this, and I remember distinctly being kinda annoyed (I just want to build products!). But then at my subsequent jobs these tasks would pop out and Id naturally say, hey Ive done this before and can take care of it. And at each job, Ive been able to get better and better at this specific skillset.\n\nWhat Im trying to say here is, I think ideally you have a couple of specializations that define you as you reach the 5-10 year range.

Here is the thing, regardless of how smart you are, you don't know that X is possible if you don't realize that X is out there, and that kind of knowledge can only come in being a specialist. Reading meticulous documentation, spec, and standards. As an example, take a look at [web.dev](https://web.dev) and see how massive the knowledge is presented over there, and that is just for frontend. Massive, massive, massive, and it keeps evolving. And yet they say FE is for code monkey. Bullshit. Absolutely not true.\n\nThere is a caveat though. You should not become a specialist in say, React, because those knowledge are temporal. This is what a lot of people are mistaken. They think they can specialize in React, Angular. But you should be specialist in say, Front End.\n\nHowever, even being a specialist vs generalist are not immune to market conditions. In majority of companies, the skill ceiling NEEDED for (majority) of companies out there for Front End, is lower, so lots of companies out there might not need very sophisticated Frontend Engineer and prefer fullstack (i.e, Backend Engineer with some Frontend experience). Even if those companies are hiring for Frontend, those companies won't necessarily want to pay top dollar for very sophisticated Frontend engineer because they won't need the skills that come with it. As a result, if you wanna get paid top dollar as a Frontend engineer, you need to go to big companies that can/will squeeze your Frontend skills and push it to its boundary, like in Facebook, Figma, Google, Netflix, etc.\n\nAnd no, you can't be an expert in a week. This is not Marvel Universe and you are not Tony Stark.",

      "It's always been like this. As someone who likes variety I had to come to the same realization.. about the same point in my career too. There will always be jobs for generalists and that is not necessarily true for specialists when some tech falls out of favor and they fail to stay a step ahead. But generalist jobs don't, never have and never will pay well. It has more to do with the type of employer who hires most generalists--smaller with lower budgets.\n\nAnother point is what is meant by \"specialist\". Due to the breadth of tech a specialist isn't necessarily a super deep expert in one specific tech. A front-end developer is a specialist, a data engineer is as \"specialist\", DevOps, QA ... all know a bunch of tools for their role. In the tech world a specialist is just not a generalist.. which would be somebody who dabbled in all of these areas. That's why I would watch out for \"full stack developer\". In 2002 that was perhaps a specialist role, now you're trying to do way too many things and you are a generalist. The role is real and it can be done don't get me wrong but only on a very small scale. You're spread too thin and don't be surprised when you find yourself working for a micky mouse mom & pop shop making super lame phone games for peanuts. The one way to make it pay BIG is to join a startup as they need people who can slap stuff together fast and wear many hats in a single day. That's a slog and a gamble of course and not for everyone.",

Plus if you have to scrounge for headcount, and then you get 500+ \"qualified\" resumes, you'll lean heavily towards safety in your hiring.",

Imagine creating a framework or something else that ends up being used by the entire company and industry.  Here, a specialist is necessary.\n\nOthers are able to see big pictures across different groups.  They see problems and opportunities, are charismatic, convince other engineers to rally behind a problem.  They're generalists, because they know enough about the space to get everyone together, but perhaps aren't trying to solve all the most difficult technical challenges as they come up.  Instead, they focus on the general direction of the effort and keep the ship going in the right direction.

    "title": "On becoming a \"principal engineer\"",
    "content": "How did you become a principal?  By accident?  By design?  How did you stay motivated? Please hint at your path if you have a moment.  \n  \nAnyone else in late career contemplating how they got to this wasteland where as an individual contributor, you are tired and no longer willing to invest the effort to go to the next rung?  Companies are just NOT willing to invest in their people and without reciprocation from them, it is all about self-motivation.  Earlier in my career, I never let this bother me and forged ahead.  But now, 20 years on, I have a handful of years left until I am probably forced to retire. Now that I can \\_possibly\\_ reach the star level of principal, I can't really get motivated.  When I was younger, I saw older developers become jaded and I said I would never become that.  Now here I am with similar weariness and a bit of anger.\n\n  \nLong ago I fell into software development because I was obsessed with understanding computers and how they work.  \n\nIt wasn't about developing a well-paying career.  I was mostly concerned with mastery of something I felt was worth learning about.\n\nNow that I've been doing this work since about 2001, I find I am just not interested in architecture nor being a \"leader\".  \n\nI stopped to examine why I feel this way.  Is it imposter syndrome?  Is it lack of confidence?  Is it lack of mastery?\n\nI have assessed the following list of real possibilities:\n\n1.   I have learned to hate software development in the corporate environment.  Politics, Agile performed poorly, the pressure of shareholders from the top have all conspired against my love.\n2.  I am not good enough to be a principal.  On code reviews, I am always missing some detail (the scanners catch code complexity, places where I could have applied code re-use, etc., missing a SOLID principle here and there)\n3. I've never stayed long enough at any one company to develop deep and wide domain knowledge.  Either the companies  technical areas were silo'd, the opportunities were there but the pay wasn't increasing with inflation...so hop and skip every two to three years.\n4. Lack of deliberate investment in my career. I just don't have the motivation to invest in tech stacks that change every couple of years.  Sure, the stack itself isn't the basis for a principal - however, the stack has impact on other decisions, practices, and types of companies.\n5. Now that certain technical areas are like a natural extension of my brain, the management wants me to spread out my focus into say, front end.  Fighting back seems pointless.  I learn just enough to be a mediocre front end dev and then I get stuck doing that work for awhile until I get the chutzpah to fight back and go back to my better skillset, the back end.\n6. As a woman, I find that there is covert and overt prejudice.  Investing in me requires some kind of mentoring and it is always a male who has no interest in doing so.  As I become less \"sexually viable\", this becomes more the case year after year.  I stopped trying to develop advocates and just do the work.  I know this is dumb.  I am human though, and banging my head on brick walls over the years has been...a test of endurance.\n\n**EDIT/Update**:  I am humbled by the responses here.  Very thoughtful, inspired and concrete ways I can approach my career.  I cant thank you enough.  I had no idea how angry and defeated I had let myself become. \n\nI have so much joy and contribution I can give once I get past this state of being.  \n\nAn emotional tide has washed over me as I remember the passion and interest I once had.

      "Career progression for engineers often stops at senior level. Sometimes because the person is not reaching the nest level, but most often because companies does not need many staff+ engineers.\n\nIf becoming title X would be your main source of satisfaction, then you would face serious disappointments after senior level.\n\nMaybe you could reflect on what is really important to you. You sound tired and possibly burnt out. Getting joy back to your daily work would possibly be a better goal than chasing a principal title.\n\n>hate software development in the corporate environment\n\nI used to work in a small company, where we managed to recruite good senior devs for lower salary than big companies, because we had smooth, common sense dev process, high team morale and no politics.\n\nCompany size is not a guarantee for a good environment, but there are places with true agile and (almost) no politics.\n\n>I am not good enough to be a principal\n\nSo what? You could still earn well and enjoy development work as a senior.\n\n>Fighting back seems pointless.\n\nMaybe you could find a place where you don't need to fight back, like a clearly backend role?\n\n>Investing in me requires some kind of mentoring and it is always a male who has no interest in doing so\n\nI'm female and have two male mentors.

I find these mentoring talks highly rewarding.\n\nAnd most importantly you could take a holiday or take a break and do stuff you enjoy (go on a hike, hang put with friends, get into pottery or crocheting).

      "There is a lot to unpack here. To be honest, your title is a question but your post is a story that sounds like personal burnout and frustration with an employer. \n\nSaying youll be forced to retire in a couple years after 20 YOE screams burnout. I dont think this is really about being a principal engineer.\n\nYou dont have to become a principal engineer. You are not a failure if you dont achieve a specific title. If you were attached to the title then you could probably apply to small startups for a year until someone gave you the title. Upon acquiring the title, youd realize that nothing has changed and youre still the same developer. Titles alone arent an absolute indicator of your abilities.\n\nSecond, much of your post complains about companies not investing in you to get to Principal. Its hard to know exactly what this means but it goes somewhat against what people associate with Principal engineering positions: The higher the title, the less youre expected to need the company to guide and mentor you. At the highest IC levels you are expected to be the one doing the mentoring, acquiring knowledge on your own, and setting technical direction for the company. If you have high expectations for the company mentoring and guiding you, that could be in conflict with the expectations of Principal Engineer roles.\n\nJust throwing it out there as a common impediment I see in people who go expect the path to Principal/Staff to be a repeat of how they went from Intern to Junior to Senior. What got you here wont get you there.\n\nFinally, you mention lack of motivation multiple times. You can blame whoever you want for the lack of motivation, but at the end of the day an unmotivated developer isnt going to be included in candidates for promotion to Principal. If you require a lot of external motivation and guiding input from the company, thats not something the company can afford to promote into important positions. You need to be the one inspiring others and helping the more junior people get motivated. If youre too resentful of a company to overcome this, you probably need to find another company where you can put it aside.",
      "TBH I'm somewhat disillusioned on Staff / Principal lately. Most organizations don't have a culture to make the typical [archetypes of Staff / Principal](https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes/) work well. IE it's hard to really own the technical direction of an area if Managers+Directors in that org are \\_really\\_ the ones driving a given direction (ie they're technical) and your ideas are just seen as a distraction from that de-facto structure. Indeed, perhaps the role as envisioned is ill conceived - as if we're giving people supposed \"power\" over an area without actually giving them power to direct people to do something.\n\nIn my experience that Staff/Principal are focused on SMEs in machine learning, or infra, etc. Where the candidates want to be paid more than the normal pay scale, and calling someone staff/principal is the loophole hiring managers can use to make that happen.\n\nI'm not complaining necessarily, but this is just the reality that seems to be happening.",

Similarly, contracting for too long is also an inhibitor to progression.\n\nL7 technical jobs are rare, and hyper competitive. 2-3 years isnt enough time to make the jump to L7.\n\nThe better option is to stay at each place 5-6 years.

      "My path to principal:\n\n\\* As I gained more experience and became more senior I was tasked more and more with translating business requirements -> technical requirements.  \n\\* Eventually I found that organizational and social constraints were what were preventing me from proposing a technical path forward. Lack of headcount, lack of collaboration, etc. Going solo and building things via heroic efforts in the face of that ended up taking a large personal toll in terms of stress+work/life balance.  \n\\* I began to work with managers and directors as peers to try to address those issues - getting motivated engineers working together, improving hiring, finding space for teams to take risks, etc.. I relied on the goodwill and capital that I had accrued with other engineers through being a strong technical contributor to achieve these outcomes.  \n\\* Before I knew it, promotion to principal.",
      "A quick note: the meaning of these titles vary. For example Google Principal >> Amazon Principal > Microsoft Principal.\n\nTwo things stick out in your post:\n\nNot staying a lot of time in a single company is very detrimental to obtaining promotion beyond Senior. You just need to understand the unwritten rules of how work gets done, you need to get a feel for a lot of people, maybe get to know some clients, understand the product space. This takes a lot of time and is hard to achieve when job hopping.\n\nSecond thing is yeah, beyond senior it becomes a different job. Caring about architecture, getting things approved through the corporate system, leading and inspiring others are much more part of the staff/principal job than coding is. If you dont like it thats fine you dont have to go beyond senior. Just understand that.",

On code reviews, I am always missing some detail (the scanners catch code complexity, places where I could have applied code re-use, etc., missing a SOLID principle here and there)\n\nThis one confuses me.  Being a principal (which I am) isn't a matter of making no mistakes.  It's knowing how to recover from them and knowing how to not repeat them (i.e., learn from them).\n\nIn this respect it's no different from the difference between, say, an expert woodworker and an amateur -- both make mistakes; the expert just knows how to recover from it while the amateur will throw it out and start over.\n\nEveryone misses something.

That said, someone handing you a mentor who has no interest in mentoring is a whole other level of idiocy on your manager.  That's their fault, not yours.  Small comfort when you're not getting mentored, I know, but you have no reason to be down on yourself over this.\n\nIn general and as others have said, this does sound like burnout.  But please allow me to list some notes here based on my experience:\n\n* Titles in the industry are fluid and non-standard.  Senior, Lead, Principal... even Manager.  They are whatever the company says they are.  As an example, I'm a Principal, but I'm functionally a Lead -- I do a lot of leadership work and only code about 10% of my time.  At my last company, I was a Lead but functionally a Manager -- I did virtually no coding and spent a lot of time managing my team down to the yearly performance reviews, complete with direct reports.  Before *that* I was an Architect who was an IC that no one wanted to listen to, and before *that* I was a Senior who was really a Lead, coding and managing the team in equal amounts.  Don't focus on titles; focus on the work you want to do.\n* I got here by speaking up.  I like to say I ended up in leadership by annoyance -- I got tired of everyone going in circles so eventually I stood up and said \"Let's do X and stop arguing about it\".  Suddenly I'm a leader.  Then I ran with it -- found what I liked and applied for jobs doing that.  I've found I'm happy leading teams, but I also know I have a limit -- I have no interest in the C-Suite, for example.  I expect I'll end my career somewhere around the VP level.\n* If you're getting pigeonholed into work you don't want to do, look for places that offer what you want.  I was once hired by a company that wanted dev and SDET work.  I told them I could do both but would prefer to do dev.  So they jammed me into test automation until I finally realized they'd never move me out of it and left.  Look for jobs that match what you want, not what they're offering.\n* Finally, remember that terminal levels are a thing and there's absolutely *no shame* in being in one.  I've had developers who wanted to remain there and never get promoted.  They were happy that their salaries would never go beyond a certain point (aside from COL increases, I presume), and I was happy to have them on board, as were my managers.  (For the record for anyone unfamiliar with the term, \"terminal levels\" are  levels where a company is happy to keep someone around indefinitely instead of taking an \"up or out\" mentality.  I've also heard them called \"parking levels\".  Senior is usually one of them -- it's a place where one can be trusted to be handed work and get it done with minimal supervision.)\n\nLook, I don't know if it will help -- and I don't know you or where you work -- but I'd be happy to discuss general career advice if you ever feel like you need it.  But even if you don't want to, I'll say this: look at what you do and what part of it you enjoy.  Look for opportunities to do what you enjoy.  Places are out there that will accomodate!  You just might need to be patient.",

      "I got to Principal via a circuitous route that involved lots of architecture roles as well as development roles at various levels.  It also involved being recruited by someone who had worked with me previously and respected what I can do both big picture architecture-wise and boots-on-ground coding wise specifically to hire on as a Principal.\n\nThe reality is the majority of developers won't ever be strong enough for a principal role.  It's not a situation where you input X years of experience and Principal title comes out of the coke machine.  Promotion paths are theoretically intended to be a pyramid where after a certain level only the strongest make it through.  Theoretically that includes staff level as well.  (And yes, some orgs have principal and not staff, some have staff and not principal, the lines are muddy).  I would say most devs won't make it past senior on either the IC track OR the management track, and that's ok.  A qualified senior dev is a valuable colleague in and of themselves, they just are focused on smaller scale stuff than a staff/principal with less \"force multiplying\" required.\n\nMost of the points you make are really laying out many the reasons why you really don't qualify to be a principal.  In addition to having the aptitude to learn the skills, I think you kind of have to care.  I think it's easier to be an effective principal if you have gone deep and gone wide, not necessarily on the same things, but you've learned what works and what doesn't and you've added every success and every failure from going deep to a little information cache that helps you analyze options and make decisions, and every new technology and business scenario you get from going wide to that box of tricks as well.\n\nExcellent communication skills are also required because of the need to be a force multiplier.  A lot of super strong technologists can't communicate well enough to help grow others, and they may never become Principals either.  Practically speaking, you have to be able to build connections with enough people at high enough level to get promoted to this level as well.\n\nTo your point 6 - I'm a 50 year old woman, and I'm pretty sure my \"sexual viability\" (to use your term) is both non-existent and irrelevant.  I've had some great mentorship over the years (mostly, but not all, from men).   Sexism exists for sure but it's not everywhere.  Some environments are far worse than others for this.  I feel I've had less problems with this than most, but not none.  I've managed to gain the respect of enough people over the years to overcome it though, part of it through luck I'm sure.\n\nIn summary, it sounds like you aren't very ambitious and unless you have both a big adjustment in ambition, effort, and capability, you're probably not going to promote past senior dev.  But it's ok to be a senior dev, just at least try to do the best job you can in the role that you have and stay at least somewhat current on new techs so you can keep as you are til retirement and don't end up obsolete in the process.",

Make sure to get your organizations description of Principal because you're going to need it.",

      "I've been a principal engineer for years now... honestly it doesn't feel any different from being a senior dev.  I've met principal engineers who definitely shouldn't be principal engineers and I've met senior engineers who are punching way above their weight.  I was at one company where pretty much everybody got the title of principal engineer after a few years.  It was kind of a joke.  One guy had absolutely no communication skills and refused to meet with people and he was a \"Senior Architect\" because he wrote some key parts of the backend (which a senior dev could have done)\n\nHonestly it's probably just a case of finding the right company and the right fit before somebody thinks you're a principal.\n\n>On code reviews, I am always missing some detail (the scanners catch code complexity, places where I could have applied code re-use, etc., missing a SOLID principle here and there)\n\nI feel like this happens even for principal engineers.  Coding is hard, the details are incredibly hard to get right even for people who have dedicated their lives to it for over 15 years like I have.\n\n>I just don't have the motivation to invest in tech stacks that change every couple of years.\n\nIf it makes you feel any better, I'm the same way.  I learn what I need to when I need to learn it.  I only learn on the job.  I've got 3 kids, I'm too busy and tired for side projects anymore.  I don't have the energy to learn about some new database or framework without a real reason to learn it.\n\n>I stopped to examine why I feel this way. Is it imposter syndrome? Is it lack of confidence? Is it lack of mastery?\n\nSounds like burn out.  I've been down that path and it can manifest in many different ways but a general malaise and lack of confidence, lack of interest, lack of motivation, feelings of hopelessness, etc are all pretty common with burnout.

How does this scale? When will you get high enough?\n* Gender - yep. This industry is very biased in general, but not in specific. There are lots of mentors and managers who actually work hard to help women even more than men. Find one or some.\n* Imposter Syndrome - Not good enough at some/many levels. I've seen estimates that 85% of people at Google in SWE have this. Welcome to the club. Then realize that if you are wondering about getting to Principle then Imposter Syndrome is not real.\n* FE vs BE - do what you like, what makes you happy. Side note: and possible bias but I haven't known many FE PE and I have known well over 100 BE PEs. Ask your manager if being a FE SWE will get you to PE.\n* MOM - Means, Opportunity, Motivation. You need all three to be \"successful\". Means - do you know what you need to do to get to PE? Do you have a plan to do so? Opportunity - does the company that you are at have the opportunity available to you. As we move higher the competition for the opportunity increases dramatically. Motivation is something that comes from within and is tied to happiness. \n* Being forced out after 20 years. BAH! I thought the same thing and stopped after nearly 40 years. Companies don't force out good devs, it's simply not in their interest.\n* Is your current position/company doing work that makes you proud?  This can have a huge impact on motivation.\n\nGL",

      "(25yoe)\n\nI got there by starting with asking questions of systemic issues, then when I wasn't satisifed with the answers/placation anymore I would research the issues myself and eventually start providing answers to those systemic issues. A systemic issue could be one of organisational structure issues, or of enterprise wide architecture - typically it's when the two diverge - or even company policy problems.\n\nThings like the question \"Why do we always have to wait for <other team/>, they always add a week to our cycle time?\" evolved to \"Why aren't we better aligning our dev teams with the business capabilities so we don't have as many cross-team dependencies?\" which then goes to \"We should move <these devs/> together with <those businessy types/> so that they can work closer and collaborate more, here's the measure of why this is a problem, and how much we could gain by solving it\" and then that further includes \"We should transfer ownership of <all the related systems/> to that group, and here is a suggestion for a future-state stack for them to migrate toward.\" with all the bells and whistles attached, but not so much it isn't flexible enough for the teams to contribute their part to the designs.\n\nWhich all seems very quick and easy but there is a *lot* of nuance skipped for the sake of the example. There are many metrics to discover and identify for first validating the problem(s) exists, then more metrics for tracking the transition/success. The hardest part is winning the hearts and minds of the teams, and leadership. Being the advocate of cuts can also be quite unpleasant.\n\n**TL;DR**: My point is I found myself to be a principal/staff when I switched from asking questions to the big, systemic, issues of arch/org, to *answering* those questions.\n\nBe the person you want to be, then you shall be rewarded - but you will (probably) need to find a new org to pick you up to the new rank as most companies don't have much room for extra principals.

      "I'll tell you what I do as an interviewer, that I think you can try to use this strategy to see if you find more success with early recruiter screens (before you get deeper into a real discussion with an EM/HM).\n\nFirst off, the generic version of \"why did you leave your last company\" is a terrible shallow question, and does not deserve anything more than a surface level answer. \"The company was struggling / going in a direction that wasn't fulfilling for me anymore, so I decided to take a break / look for new opportunities\" -- that's a pretty non-descript non-answer that should pretty much check the box every time, of giving a passable answer that doesn't require further explanation. \n\nHowever, if you really feel like you want to establish a deeper level of communication, then here's what I suggest -- when I am personally the interviewer, I don't ask the generic \"why did you leave\" version, instead I typically ask \"tell me what you enjoyed about your last job, and also what was missing or what new thing(s) you are looking to get from a new position\". If your interviewer asks the generic variant, just pretend they asked my more specific variant instead, and frame your answer as if you were answering my question instead of the generic variant. \n\nWhy is this better? Because you get to talk about YOUR MOTIVATIONS instead of focusing on bad-mouthing your last employer. You can still express ideas like, \"I am looking for high-integrity, inspirational leadership\", or maybe \"I want to join a more rigorous company, so I can learn how to operate with higher standards\"... There's so many ways to communicate your ideas, without having to focus on bad-mouthing, but you do need to learn how frame a conversation (or change how it is initially framed), instead of letting yourself have a bad conversation with someone, just because a lazy recruiter didn't offer you the ideal frame off the bat... So what if the first prompt is not ideal, you can influence it, since interviews are a joint dialogue! Proactively shaping a conversation to take the framing that most benefits you, is actually the secret trick to higher level interviewing (as a middle manager or above), vs just taking what is given to you and locking yourself into that initial frame.",

      "I would be as vague as possible until people press you for a real answer. If pressed, heres how I would frame it:\n\nMy previous company decided to change course dramatically in a direction that I strongly felt did not align with my values. I tried to voice my concerns but it became clear that the decision had been made and it was not going to change. \n\nI have a lot of respect for the leadership team, and I know they made what they felt was the best decision for the business. Unfortunately it was a direction that I just didnt feel comfortable being a part of. \n\nIm heartbroken because I really thought I would be at that company for a long time, but at the end of the day my gut told me that my discomfort would make it difficult for me to lead my team in a way that aligned with the companys expectations, so I made the difficult decision to cut ties instead of sticking it out. It was a very tough decision that I didnt take lightly.\n\nI learned from this experience that its very important to me to find a company whose corporate values strongly align with mine, and from what Ive learned about this company so far, I think we could be a good fit. I like XYZ that Ive read/heard people say.\n\nFrame your leaving as the best decision for the business, not just for you.\n\nIf people want even more details, share as much as you can but keep it focused on the business reasons behind the decisions the company made, and make it clear that you understand the reason why leadership felt that was the right way to go. Then explain what about it made you feel uncomfortable.\n\nMaybe hearing your reasoning turns some companies off, but thats probably a good thing!",
      "The job did not meet my expectations of responsibility that I was looking for.  If they ask for details, just tell them what type of responsibilities you are looking for, and say the last job didn't meet them.\n\nOr:\n\nThere was a family situation that forced me to quit but the problem is solved now and won't come up again.\n\nThey legally can't ask follow up questions, and it's technically true, as you are a member of your family.",
      "Remember recruiters are also doing their jobs. They can agree with you all they want, but in the end if youre a red flag by their company standards you shouldnt be hired.\nMy r/antiwork opinion is to focus on yourself and your interests and tell them what you want to hear in the language they want to hear it.",
      "Yeah, delving deep into the problems wont help, I have been rejected twice in a behavioural because of this.\n\nProbably somethings along the lines of, outgrowing roles, or lack of opportunity or new role that isnt available at previous or something about the company you are interviewing at, wasnt present previously.\n\n**Manager is not your therapist**",

      ">The company was about to implement a couple of changes that I consider unethical and against my values, so I left. First time in my long career that I did that.\n\nI've done this, or had it happen to me, 2 times in my 10 career in start ups. I learned from a corporate ax welder long ago that when there's a big change at a company (layoff, re-structure, fundamental change in mission/product) people fall into roughly three equally sized groups: those that fully embrace the change, those that will \"go along to get along\" and muddle threw but ultimately stay on mission, and those that take a look at the new state of things, and just decide \"nope\".\n\nI've been in all three groups, in about even proportion, it's just natural that sometimes you'll like that change and agree, or other times you don't like it, and should really leave.\n\nI've always gotten away with poising it like this: I joined a company and was excited to work a on, but unfortunately that mission subsequently failed and required changes, and I'm looking for opportunities that are more aligned with my personal beliefs, which I believe is your company. Say it in your own words, but don't bring up scary words like \"unethical\", but poise it as a matter of direction and alignment.\n\nThat's not always going to work, but in start ups, people understand that there are radical changes to companies, and that some of those changes will alienate workers. That's really a management failure, not a failure on your part. They also know that their current mission might not be what they are doing in 3-5 years, but you need to hire folks that are aligned with the mission as it exists, and that's exactly what is attracting you.\n\nIMO, it's always okay to leave a project when the fundamentals of what you are doing change. IMO, if the original company wanted you to stay, they'd be throwing out a massive amount of stock at you to make it worth your while. If they didn't, then you really aren't that important to them, and it's okay to leave.",

A couple bits of advice:\n\nTo the OP:\n\n* People leave jobs all the time for a bunch of reasons.  \"It wasn't a fit\", \"Wanted a change\", \"Didn't like the direction leadership was going\", \"I'm looking for something that would better utilize \\[these skills\\]\", \"Looking for a company that offers \\[...\\]\" are all fine answers.  I would avoid giving anything that raises eyebrows like \"Ethical mismatch\" -- I doubt it can help much, probably is a turn off for some.\n* One job probably doesn't matter much, if you have a track record for bouncing from a lot of jobs, that will not help.\n* The market sucks right now especially for managers.  It's gonna be a grind no matter what.\n\nTo everyone else:\n\n* This is why you keep savings and backup plans.  It takes guts to quit over something like what the OP is describing, but... expect to deal with the consequences of that choice.

      "i left my last role similarly, and when i was job searching i kinda framed it in terms of what my red flags would be going forward. I would say 'i was burned out by my last employer' , they would ask why, and i would say 'well, for example my manager called me on my vacation over a non-critical problem' and i think that helped set the tone of what im looking for in my next role, and didnt come off as bad mouthing. you may want to consider re-framing it in a similar way? I dont know if this helps but i always frame it with saying \"i dont want to bad mouth anyone, but this was what happened to me and what i want to avoid going forward\".",
      "Simple: Don't tell them. You are under no obligation to go into details about why you left any job and what you tell them is up to you.\n\nIf you'd been there for a while simply say, \"I was feeling very static and like there was much left for me to learn there so I decided to take the risk and make a change.\" \n\nI you haven't been there very long (year or less) simply say, \"It just didn't feel like a good fit for me.\"\n\nPeople don't really care why you left another job. Also, how you tell people lets them know if you want to keep going on about it. If you state it matter of factly and don't include phrases like, \"You know?\" or other conversational words it's a soft clue that it's not a thing you're interested in talking about.\n\nIf they do pressure you for more? Simply start talking about what you're looking for. The implication is you didn't find it where you were. Is that actually why you left? Who can say?",

      "I have done this, you need to find a positive spin that emphasizes elements you want to highlight. Fortunately it's a question you can anticipate and prepare, as you are doing here.\n\n\nFor me it was \"The company made some bad decisions and started to implode. I was among a number of people who could see it coming and approached the CEO but <gesture>. Half our C group quit in one week, I left when I could and ensured that my team had options. One chose to stay for a while longer but the others all landed nice new roles at higher salaries.\"\n\n\nI'm deliberately generalizing the issue and glossing over it. In truth it was the acts of an individual but that's not what I want to communicate, it also makes me angry to talk about it. I then cover that I tried to resolve it internally, I'm also starting to broaden it to others, it wasn't just me who had the issue. I pull in the fact that others quit, the story I'm telling isn't about me, it's the company that went wrong. Finally I pivot on to my leadership, how I led my team through the transition.\n\n\nI believe the team element is the line they remember. Typically the next question is one about team management.\n\n\nI suggest you do something similar. As others have said I would emphasize the change rather than the absolute ethical position. That's the crux of it but also because people tend to judge ethical actions against their own ethical positions, and you have no idea what those are. But broaden the story, what did you do before you quit? What did others do? As a manager how did you communicate the company changes to your people? How did you communicate your departure? And why did you do these things, what do you want to communicate about yourself and your values?\n\n\nI would advice against pulling the NDA or can't disclose card. HR in particular is going to see straight through that and just pull out the red pen. They aren't asking to to disclose company secrets.",

      "I left after 3 months because of similar reasons. I am honest about it with a toned down version of the things that happen. I also follow it up with the fact that the entire dev team left the business within a couple of months of me leaving.",
      "Im in a similar boat and in my interviews I simply dont bring it up. If they ask, I say I very much enjoyed my time at the company, worked with great people, and felt like it was time to look for new opportunities and challenges.\n\nThey are looking for a teammate, not baggage. Like others have stated, an interview is not long enough to properly explain any particular situation adequately enough. It also is high risk / low reward from a hiring perspective, meaning they could believe you and it still doesnt move the needle on the hiring decision and thats best case.",
      "I would say:\n\nThe company was about to implement a couple of changes that I consider unethical and against my values, so I left. First time in my long career that I did that.\n\nAnd when they ask. Can you tell some more details. I would give one detail and would say: this is not something I like. I really dont want to say bad things about others\n\nI had great success with saying that in the past",
      "Recruiters and hiring managers can be frustratingly fickle when it comes to job changes, especially short stints. The reality is, you don't owe anyone a detailed explanation of why you left. A simple \"I realized the company's values didn't align with my own\" is more than sufficient. If they press for details, you can politely deflect by saying you'd prefer not to discuss specifics out of respect for your former employer, but that you're excited to find a role that's a better fit.\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in overthinking how to explain every career move. But at the end of the day, most interviewers care more about your skills and what you can bring to their company than the minutiae of why you left your last job.

We cant risk resting on our laurels at a cushy job, because if something happens to that job, its extremely hard to get another one. This is obvious, since just 5 years ago I remember everyone was a cloud engineer and those were the shiny jobs at big tech. Then it was AR/VR. Then it was web3. Now its AI.\n\nHow then is it possible to grow the skillset needed to keep up with the whims of the market if every job asks 3-5 years experience in the new bleeding edge buzzword. I just finished my masters in data science/AI after 6 years in the field doing devops and test automation, and still feel like I am barely keeping up. I'm currently job hunting and it is just exhausting as I constantly feel unskilled compared to my competition. I wish this was a job that if you can get past all your degrees and certs, you were good for a 40 year career, but that just doesn't exist anymore. I'm getting close to my third burnout since I broke into this field and I'm not sure what to do.\n\nI don't want to give up though as I recognize that this career offers returns that other career tracks cant match.

Businesses that can't even distinguish what is real and what is not is not where I would bet my next few years on.\n\nIf you're not doing it for fun (you actually like learning new tech, doing what's cool atm and so on), you need to be practical about it.

If you learned React when it became popular, you still have jobs today. (Maybe not with all the competition, but jobs exist.) If you got into Vue you have transferable skills. With Angular maybe you also have a job in some places that haven't moved on yet.\n\nWhat makes these technologies different from Blockchain or LLMs?\n\nFor me, at the briefest of glance into these things, you will see how impractical and in need of a problem these hype solutions exist on top of. Unlike others which are born exactly in the midst of solving a problem (and at the same time is demonstrated to solve such a problem).\n\nMy guess is Zig is here to stay, just like Go. Perhaps also Rust, though I am less optimistic about that.\n\nML is also useful. But perhaps not as applicable as a Software Engineer. But as a Data Analyst, ML specialist and so on?\n\nMy guess is LLM wrappers will die pretty soon. It will survive in some way (like blockchain does today) but the hype won't be on Software Engineers to integrate, but for ML specialists to innovate and such.\n\n(If you were a rare breed of SE and ML researcher, you lucked out but also did you? Are you actually on top of both expertise? Unless you have a friend catching you up on experiences and best practices and new news, I don't think you have enough ability to strut out for the unicorn experience that don't actually exist that some companies are looking for.)\n\nDon't follow the hype.

People can say AI and VR aren't materializing, but they're being silly. AI isn't going to take our jobs, but it will remove where we get jobs. Many people work on informational CRUD sites and AI will crush that. You can look at meta quest sales, VR is growing and arguably in a real spot to succeed. People think because it has a hype cycle where there's a lot of hype that doesn't materialize all at once that a new tech paradigm won't be successful, yet we're all on here after the dotcom bubble. \n\nThere are immediate skills you can have:\n\n1. Basic datastructures and algorithms. Those who say they never use them are usually web developers that might have a questionable future. I personally use the basics all of the time. I don't mean do leetcode either, even though it helps, just get to know the date structures well enough that you know what to use and when.\n\n2. low level skills. Understand network protocols and a lower level programming language. Understand the computer. (This is where I haven't fully gotten to in my years in, but am learning.)\n\n3. Software design patterns. You need to be able to recognize that there could be a use for one and be able to have a good enough sense to use a few commons or google a few others. \n\n4. Clean code/SOLID. I'm not a fan of this one, but most companies are. \n\nIt doesn't matter what anyone says, you've now just asserted that you're farther than skilled devs in a particular language if they haven't done that. Chances are you need to learn the above once. \n\nFor hype stuff: just buy a course and watch it. You don't need to to become an VR developer, but you can go easily watch an Unreal engine tutorial and know at least what's going on. The same goes with AI and LLMs. You don't need to train your own model, but knowing how one works is great and helpful. You might come across something like this ever two years. It's really not a big deal.\n\nThen for keeping your skills up, develop a person project where you might put 20 hours into it a month. The project should be something you like, want to learn, and that challenges you.",

    "title": "Need input on potential career change from IC to EM",
    "content": "So, I've been at my current company for almost 6 years now. It's a big multi-national corporation and I've had the chance of moving laterally across different Business Units and coding in different projects. For the past 3 years I've been working on this BU where I've moved up from SW Eng to a SW Architect (which is basically more design / technical roadmap & mentoring than actual coding).\n\nThe problem is that I've hit the ceiling- in terms of learning and career progression.  Let me explain. For better or worse, I believe I know the current product inside-out and there are no new things for me to learn. Also, even my slightest attempt to introduce new tech, that would improve some of our performance issues, gets blocked by management due to business priorities... In addition, there's no other technical position above my current one that I could move up to (the company is more management oriented when it comes to carving out employees' career paths) and moving to another BU is (for the time being) not feasible.\n\nOn the other hand there are some good things stemming from my current situation. For one, there's no stress at all. I'm totally autonomous, work on my own pace and have no LM pushing deadlines down my throat. Of course, there are project deadlines but my point is that I'm handling them myself- don't have a manager above my head constantly asking for updates and what not. This situation leads to me having a great deal of freedom in the way I work also allowing me to work remotely (even pre-COVID19) whenever I want. This also leads to me being able to completely shut off when I log off and not work outside my normal working hours (I mention this as an advantage because I understand that this is a huge deal in our industry).\n\nAs the title says I'm torn as to what my next step should be. That's why, in an effort to maybe clear things up a bit,  I'm seeking other experienced devs' input on my situation.\n\n**Option #1:**\n\n\\- Stay at my current job. This would allow me to (probably) coast for the rest of my time here and enjoy a totally autonomous, relaxed, low-stress way of life; three elements that are not that easy to find in the industry. As far as the cons go, well, they were pretty much explained above.\n\n**Option #2:**\n\n\\- Move to a new company as an Engineering/Tech Manager. This option would capitalize on the skills I've gained in my current position (tech management of a distributed team, people and tech managing of teams etc). **Pros**: More pay (for some reason management pays more, on avg, than a technical role), more autonomy than a s/w eng. position; better chances of climbing that career ladder as more positions are available to managers (I'm a type A personality...); more impact (?) as I will have a saying on key product/strategy decisions; less stress than an IC (I'm not really sure of this but I think that,on average, the stress of actually building the product is less than managing the guys who build the product); pay is more than an IC **Cons:** I'm not really sure that spending most of my day in meetings and creating ppt presentations will make for an interesting day to day job; not that many open positions for eng. management where I live (this means that If one gets fired there won't be many other similar jobs to go to); Less flexibility than IC in terms of remote work, time off, leave etc\n\n**Option #3:**\n\n\\- Move to a new company as an IC. **Pros:** Will learn new stuff/technologies and day to day will be more interesting than being a manager; More flexibility wrt working from home, working hours etc; Not (much) overtime; Because of the previous points, I reckon that my way of life will be more stable (in contrast to being a manager where there's a tendency to work past 5/6pm); generally, I like experimenting with new technologies and I like implementing mini projects on my spare time so I think by doing that professionally, it'll be a good use of my time **Cons:** less pay than a manager (again this is due to the country/market I'm in), will probably not be that much autonomous due to having a manager above my head and will for sure not be that much autonomous as I currently am, I think that the rush from using new technologies, and building exciting stuff will eventually fade away and in the long run this position will end up being only about fixing bugs. This means that I'll eventually have to move to a new job thus being part of a huge rat race; higher stress- associated with having to keep up with deadlines; unless this job's about a product/service that I'll be heavily invested in (slim chances), I think I'll not be having such big of an impact and will be just another cog in the wheel; I believe I won't ever be *that* good so as to climb to any position. This is due to the fact that there are other devs who are better than me and will have more experience in the new company. So indeed another cog in the wheel...\n\nSo, experienced developers of this sub-reddit, what would you do If you were in my shoes? Any advice? Have you ever been in a similar situation?",

I did it for 2 years, was miserable, and am now back to an IC and couldn't be happier.\n\n> less stress than an IC (I'm not really sure of this but I think that,on average, the stress of actually building the product is less than managing the guys who build the product);\n\nYou couldn't be more wrong.  You have all of the responsibility of building things and not much control over it.  Imagine going about your daily routine, except you have to watch someone else do it as you instruct them.",
      "Im going to echo everyones comments about your thinking with regards to a move to management. Management is literally a different type of job. Moving to a role where you dont write any code anymore and you manage people can make a lot of folks unhappy. I made the move consciously and have never been happier, but it was a huge change. I was lucky to have a few mentors that helped prepare me for that role. \n\nIf its just about money, Id look for another IC role. Youve seemingly got the experience on that end and its what will make you happier. There is still more growth to be had there, and its better to make the move to management with eyes wide open as to what that means. Its better than doing that for a few years and hating it and trying to find your way back and realizing your coding has gotten a bit rusty.",
      "Its very difficult to be hired externally as a manager without any managerial experience (I would say its almost impossible, honestly).\n\nAs a manager myself, I would say that the role is very rewarding and challenging, and I would recommend anybody interested to try it as long as theyre willing to make the skill investments.\n\nAs far as progressing in your career, think about progress on two axis: complexity and responsibility. Do you want to do more challenging stuff? Do you want to be responsible over more things? Both?\n\nIf you just want more challenge, I suggest remaining an IC and asking your manager for more challenging projects, explore a transfer of team, or join a new company. If you want some of the latter, you may want to explore management, especially if youre already at a high IC level such as architect, where youre already responsible for a great deal of things (architecture, onboarding, eng culture to a large degree). If you still find yourself pining to have even more or even sole responsibility then you might have topped out in this role, especially if what you want more influence over is team, product, company or business related.",
      "Management because of not being bored at the current position seems to be a bad idea mainly because managerial track requires different skills and contains different responsibility. Now what you do is mostly technical and dont interact with other people much (ofc depending on your position and company)\n\nBut managerial track would make you code less and interact with the code base less (ofc this differring widely). As a manager you would need to be responsible for the project and your team. So a lot of mentoring, understanding your peers and employees, tracking your subordinates career growth. In some places being manager would mean that you dont code anymore.\n\nSo you need to change your mindset and evaluate your skills and mindsets. Definitely not for everyone, especially when they dont like to take care of people and teams. It is better to move to another company which a higher ladder for ICs.",
      "You contradicted yourself. You say that you are totally autonomous, but management wont let you introduce new tech. You may not be as autonomous as you think. \n\nReading _The Manager's Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change_ by Camille Fournier helped me think about the switch from IC to EM, and I ultimately chose to remain an IC because I felt there was more I could learn. The first time I was faced with this dilemma, I changed companies to get experience at a larger scale. The second time I changed teams within the new company to get deeper ownership and leadership experience.",

There are pro and cons to those - the pro for me is being different industry and understanding how it works from behind the scene. I have worked in Mobile App, Games, Renewal energy, and Real Estate. Now I want to get into Health Care, EV or crypto because I enjoy learning the various industries. You also get to be in various styles of managements - where some would give you the freedom to select your tech and improve the dev experience.\n\nFrom my perspective, you should go into Tech Lead role which provides mix of EN and IC. You don't have to join a new company as a tech lead, you can always join as IC with growth potential to Tech Lead.",
      "I have a little over 10 yoe, have been staff level at a midsize company, am at a different company where I am effectively the same.  \n\nI've been offered opportunities to switch to a purely managerial role and I've turned them down because the bulk of that job seemed like it would be worse for me.\n\nAt a high enough level I don't think the two are that different aside from a few key things.  \n\nSomething to keep in mind: higher the level as an IC the more meetings you will be in.  You don't get people to buy into an idea by just... saying it.  There is definitely politicking involved.  I am not in as much as a pure manager but it is definitely far more than zero!  I don't think you can reasonably be at this level unless you are some deep specialist without acting in some managerial capacity.\n\nYou will mentor in either gig.  I mentor 3 other folks indirectly (they will ask me for advice, etc.)  I will spend a fair bit of time coaching them.  I will help them code better by pair programming or via code reviews. Helping them structure some of their work to keep them on the rails.  The difference between myself and a manager is more around motivation.  If I can get them to do lower lever work I don't have to and can focus on higher level concerns and have broader influence.  A manager needs them to be good because they are relying on them to get things done as their rating is based on the performance of others.  Personal problems someone has don't directly effect me (I care but don't have to deal with it).  I can't hire and fire people, I can ask for resources for a task but ultimately resourcing is managerial.\n\nI am honestly not coding as much these days but can always hop in.  My work is really more around architecting systems (documentation and presentations are big here), doing tech talks to help educate our engineers, scoping work, mentoring, and convincing management to do certain slots of work.  \n\nI am effectively a manager but with softer power and different motivations.  \n\nJust something to consider as an alternative path.  I'd also note a lot of places don't get how to handle engineers like this, but I think the industry as a whole is getting a better handle on it.",
      "There are lots of pitfalls to management. Unfortunately I've seen many who are utterly unqualified in terms of soft skills.

    "content": "I have a little under 10 YOE in total. I've switched jobs three times before as a junior/medior developer and the transition has been easy enough: the goal is to familiarize with the application and a codebase and start contributing as soon as possible. I've been with my current employer for almost 6 years now and over the years I've went from a medior dev to senior dev to a lead, and most recently I've been a part of \"solutions architect\" pool which are basically experienced developers that help out on any company's project, as per need. I have never switched companies while being titled a \"senior\", but I did switch through lot of company's projects and that part was somewhat ok.\n\nAnyway, I obviously have decent experience behind me and a month ago I've accepted the offer from another company. They're planning on assigning me to a project or two for the beginning, and transition me into the same type of company-level architect in the next year.\n\nWhile the position sounds extremely exciting I would be lying if I said I weren't scared of the expectations. It's been a while since I had to prove myself to someone and especially at this level. I talked a lot with this company's most experienced developers, with a CTO and CEO... they have high expectations from me so it is a bit frightening. I'm considered a senior in my current employer and people inherently trusted my decisions and thoughts on anything so I'm not sure how this will pan out switching to a new company.\n\nAre there any tips you can share on how to handle switching jobs, but as a more senior developer? Try to be proactive or sit down and take in everything I can? When is the right time to pitch some new ideas if I have them?\n\nI've heard a couple of tips and the main one is to talk with my direct supervisor(s) and set up goals for 3-6-12 month period, i.e. to make expectations clear from both sides. If you have similar items you can share please let me know.. and any past experiences you had, obviously, doesn't matter if they're be good or bad ones really :)\n\nThank you very much!",

Set up your dev environment, clone the repos, figure out how to run the tests and debug locally, figure out how the team manages work and handles pull requests and reviews, get all the standing meetings on your calendar, etc.\n\nYou need to have the correct mindset, though.  After 6 years at your current job you probably know all the big picture stuff, the dark corners of the system, and are probably _the_ expert on some of them.  That's going to take time to replicate at the new place, and that's fine.  Nobody expects you to come in and have that level of clarity or contribution at the new place right off the bat.\n\nFor my most recent job change I chose to work it like a jigsaw puzzle, establish the borders first so you know what the boundaries are, what's in, what's out (third parties, external systems not owned by your group, etc), who the stakeholders are, who sets priority and makes decisions.

Scheduling calls/meets with other contributors, getting questions answers (knowing what questions to ask).\n\nDepending on the caliber of the team , the complexity of the domain, and your familiarity with it you may or may not be  able to contribute from day one and may or may not be able to identify problems others haven't.\n\nI like the analogy that a junior dev is a freshman, getting their bearings on college, homework, and a routine to be successful. Experienced devs are the upper classman who already know how to exist in college and what they need to do, generally, to be successful.",

Ive spent 20 years in software delivery, starting as a manual tester before moving into automation (Typescript + Cucumber) and helping teams adopt a quality-first/test-first mindset. This led to a Scrum Master role in 2020, where I also took on line management for a team of 7. Earlier this year, after my company eliminated agile roles, I transitioned to an Engineering Manager position. While it feels similar to what I was doingcoaching teams, focusing on quality, and supporting career growthI now carry the title of 'manager' rather than 'coach.'\n\nMy challenge is imposter syndrome. Ive never been a developer, and while I can hold my own in discussions about quality and DevOps, I worry about my future prospects. If I lost my job tomorrow, could I land another EM role without deeper technical expertise? The Scrum Master role felt like my sweet spot: technical enough without requiring heavy dev experience, but that role seems to be fading across the industry. Now Im questioning whether to invest in expanding my technical chops or pivot toward something like Agile Delivery Lead, as I try to figure out where I can add the most value.\n\nHow do you feel about being managed or coached by someone without dev experience? Is there room in the industry for someone like me in leadership roles, or do I need to level up technically to stay competitive?

      "This may be anecdotal but I am seeing a shift in the industry away from non-technical or highly hands off roles. In a few large companies in Australia, this was done by removing the line manager role completely and forcing people into IC roles (senior or staff, depending on tenure). About half of the managers were not able to transition and got laid off.\n\nI think this mostly has to do with the dynamics of the industry - when its booming, everyone has a seat at the table because even a little bit of productivity helps and money is free. Now that the industry is contracting, it makes more sense to hire/keep doers because plenty of them are also keen to manage and can be decent at it.\n\nFor your question, I wouldnt double down on what some people might refer to as bullshit or fluff roles like Agile delivery. Youre already on a team with engineers writing code - learn the technical chops from them and get to a level where its easy for you to gain technical trust and interview well on technical subjects. A sweet spot is to ask yourself whether youd be competitive with a senior engineer on your team if you were told to do IC work only.",

But I wouldn't pick a non technical manager if it were up to me.\n\nThe main issue is that you need to know what it feels like being under pressure to deliver. What does it feel like to be asked for an estimate when you only know part of the ask? What are the technical ambiguities? If you haven't been in that situation, I don't see most people being able to manage someone who is in that position.\n\n\\> do I need to level up technically to stay competitive?\n\nThat would take years in the trenches. Not decades, but a good few years.\n\nI hate to be the bringer of bad news. I know it's hard out there, and people want to keep their jobs.

It takes time to learn a new code base, dont feel like you need to make an immediate impact. \n\nUnless its like my last company who put me on a feature 2 weeks in, with a language Ive never used, then youll be in for a rough ride. \n\nYoure gonna be fine, trust yourself.",
      "There's a concept in onboarding where managers should identify your network - who you should be spending time to get to know. Think about the cross functional relationships you've had at your previous company, and how valuable they were to get things done. I specifically always made time to get to know platform engineering / infrastructure, they got a lot of sway and know how things are done.\n\nThe reality is managers are usually bad at onboarding / planning these things, and its the responsibility of the new hire to make it happen. If I were you, i'd identify a person per day to grab a coffee or virtual coffee with, and do it. Or better yet, ask your manager for 2 - 3 intros, and then when you meet with them, ask them who you should meet with, and it will grow.\n\nYou don't need to talk shop or engineering, just get to know them. Relationships are super important in any org. Literally just ask simple questions: \"Whats your story? Whats your favorite thing about working here? What do you wish you knew from the start? Anything you would recommend me to be doing?\"\n\nOnce you've met a bunch of people, then you can identify who is the most valuable to deepen your relationships with.\n\nAlso the other thing is even if you are senior, just say out loud you're gonna ask a lot of questions and they may sound like stupid questions, but the more you are unburdened by the fear of asking questions, the quicker you learn.\n\nJust my 2 cents. Best of luck",
      "I'm a senior, and have been a tech lead for a while. I usually try to absorb over the course of a month, without making major suggestions or trying to make changes. Then, just as a consequence of being plugged in, I'll see some problem developing, or realize there's a gap in capability, and be able to apply my expertise to solve it.\n\nI can't say there's a rubric or guide I've ever used, but communication is key, like others have said. Make sure you set up 1:1s with your team to learn the state of the world, but keep a line of dialogue open with management. The \"hard\" thing about the staff role is learning how to bridge that gap between management's expectations, and the reality of the codebase.",

I just write it down. I don't tell the team everything that I think they're doing wrong. I don't show up at retro with all the stuff I think they need to change. I just watch, and listen, and I write down everything that seems deeply weird.",
      "Ask questions and learn. Unless there are obvious critical issues like security threats focus on becoming knowledgeable in the \"as is\".

Learn the friction points and the team needs.\n\nAll basic stuff that should be engrained by now, especially after 10 years.",

      "I've noticed that I'm perceived in a better light at a new place or team if I participate. Ask clarifying questions, don't stay quiet but also listen and absorb, suggest things but be ready to be told it's not a good idea. Ask why so you can fill in the missing gaps you have in your mental model. In other words, do both - suggest things and absorb. Stay engaged, be reasonably cordial and at least the first few months take some initiative. This should take you a long way. A lot of people don't do that and these are the people that don't get promoted and don't advance.",

Once you feel okay then if you see something that could be improved, talk to someone about it, but make damn sure you dont talk shit about what they currently have. Be nice basically. Im sure youll be fine. Also dont kill yourself to prove value. Remember the beginning sets the tone for your tenure.

    "content": "My career history has been interesting. \nFor the last 12 years, Ive ping ponged between generic front end dev and content manager.\nMy last two jobs Ive been a senior front end dev.\n\nMy stack has always been Bootstrap/Jquery. Ive always easily found jobs for it, and never been in a work environment where anything else was used.\n\nIve used other CSS and JS libraries on the side, but just beginner code tutorials when applying to jobs previously. Jobs that I didnt get for not having professional experience in said libraries.\n\nI honestly didnt even use Git till 2020, as most of my dev work has been through things like WebSphere and other enterprise content management systems. \nThe modern dev world is just not the world Ive lived in professionally and Ive realized it to late.\n\n\nI know the job market is insane right now, and my resume likely wont make it past filters for senior gigs without the latest and greatest libraries listed, or being thoroughly experienced with things like git and npm.\n\nHow do I move forward without having to restart my career as a junior dev again.\nId been fine not doing dev work anymore if theres a natural transition out that Im not aware of.",
    "comments": [
      "You arent seen as a senior, but you probably know your shit though. Your issue is that you didnt keep up with the transition in software development and only spent time managing legacy JS code.\n\nId get up to date with modern ECMA and definitely learn your way around git. It is mandatory, no discussion. Then you could look at some of the highly popular FE libraries/Frameworks like React or Vue and try and understand whats going on there.\n\nYou also could at least spend time learning the basics of containerization and software deployment. Every decent company out there deploys their own application somewhere somehow and its a good thing to know what they are even talking about when you are interviewing.\n\nI think your basics should be solid, but you stagnated for years and now you got left behind. Never stop learning and reading about topics in this field.",
      "Knowing the latest tech vs outdated tech doesn't make you a Senior dev vs a Junior dev. You're not going to go back to needing someone to cut your tasks up into 1-2 day slices and check in on you two times a day, learn how to work in a professional setting, learn how to read other people's code, etc. There's more to being Senior then the tech stack you're familiar with.\n\nThat being said, you're right that being on an older stack still will make you less marketable, so you either need to find a company that is still living in that long tail of older tech or start catching up on something newer.\n\nPersonally, I would advise you to start working on projects with React. Don't try to learn several new FE frameworks at the same time, one will be enough of a jump and React is the most popular one in the market right now, to maximize your chances. One idea would be to find a couple basic 1-2 projects that have design elements included to get started learning the basics (use create react app, next, or similar to get started, don't bother hand-rolling webpack/vite/whatever). Then pick something a bit more complex that includes some data manipulation and more dynamic content. I'd also suggest using git aas you go, maybe even breaking the work up into some small tasks and making sure you're committing for each (will help you practice git, but also help you plan and see progress as you're working on things).\n\nThe key elements you want to learn are:\n* Using React: note: you want newer React, so hooks not class components. \n* Newer CSS: a lot more is available now, experiment with newer CSS or with a newer library (I personally think getting comfortable with raw CSS is more valuable than the latest library, but make sure it's new and not just more bootstrap)\n* Newer JS: JS has continued to move forward, it would be worth skimming some posts on additions to the language\n\nI considered adding TypeScript, but I think it's more important to try and get several tiny and small projects under your belt with those 3 above first.\n\n[Frontend Mentors free projects](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges?types=free) is one place to find some projects. Github is one of the most popular places for folks to use git for side projects. For task tracking, Github issues is probably good enough unless you have a preferred tool already.",
      "This is where all the soft skills come into play.  You've proven you can code.  But do you know agile? Can you handle a high stress problem? Are you a team player? Can you learn something new and teach your coworkers?  Can you work a problem without a lot of babysitting?",
      "It shouldn't be too difficult for you to learn one of the new frameworks like Vue or React. I recently coached a newly hired mid-level developer who had experience similar to yours on Vue and she picked it up in a couple of weeks. Within a couple of sprints, she was able to start doing the bulk of the work on the project, allowing me to start on another one. \n\nSo far as job opportunities go, target companies that are revamping legacy web apps. They're likely to need someone with old expertise who are also comfortable with handling the learning curve for new frameworks.",
      "You sound like most of the over-40 devs at my company, lol. They have been at this place 10 years or more, and just get by on the fact that they know the system so well, keep getting paid well enough to stick around... but as I'm discovering, as we modernise our codebase, basic shit like ES6 is a mystery to them.\n\nIf you wanna keep goldbricking, learning most of this new shit shouldn't take you that long. You can cover the basics of Git in an afternoon. `git pull`, `git push`, `git checkout -b feature/feature-branch-name` is about all you need to know to get started. Any decent company will have locks on the vital branches like master and develop so you can't fuck them up.\n\nAs for frameworks, something like React (or Vue; I use Vue) might be more of a stretch, but if you've been coding for this long I don't see why you can't learn it. All it does is basically tidy up all those event listeners and shit for you, packaging everything away in components. Instead of writing a click handler for an element, you write `@click=\"doThis()\"` on an element on <div> tag, like `<div @click=\"doThis()\">` and then `doThis()` is the method that does whatever. These kind of frameworks have their own syntax and structure to learn, but... it's just syntax and structure. The fundamentals of what it's all trying to do should be fairly obvious.\n\nnpm is no mystery either. It's a package manager. Instead of importing modules at the top of every file, or in some master index.js file called by every other file, you have a .json file that lists the modules you want, and then you run `npm install` and they're installed. That's it.\n\nI think you've overcomplicating how much you really need to learn. You can probably learn a few things, blag the rest, and learn on the job. As a junior Dev, I didn't know Vue, knew a bit of React from a tutorial I did, blagged my way onto my first proper job as a front-end dev, and learned Vue on the go. I always lol at the feedback from my manager back then about how my knowledge of the framework really helped them get a project off te ground, lolz.",
      "First of all, I think you're selling yourself short by focusing on what you *don't* know. What are the things you *do* know that some kid right out of college doesn't? Twelve years of real project work in the real world is valuable, you just have to figure out how to take that value and figure out how to \"sell\" it.\n\nSecond, a skills refresh is doable. Hit the books and set aside 3-4 hours a day to learn this stuff. Git isn't really that hard to understand. I haven't done any frontend work since 2013 and I'm planning to learn React for a side project. I do exclusively backend work in Go so I haven't even touched JS in many years.

I have considered doing the same as I find the UX topic interesting but I'm not looking to get more formal education at this time.

Framework is too narrow of a focus for a senior developer, IMO. It's not about jQuery or React or Vue or whatever. I should be able to ask you to go make some simple changes to our Node API server, or to our mobile app written in Dart + Flutter, or to our AWS cloud configuration, or to a free-standing service written in Python, and your software development skills should give you the foundation to do those things yourself.\n\nI dunno.

Wondering what others have done in this situation\n\n===\n\nHi all, I'm a software engineer with \\~7 YOE who left a FAANG (Amazon) job in 2022 so I could try building my own \"business\"... in a completely different industry (game development). The decision was originally made so I could both focus on my mental health (uncovered ADHD) as well as see what would happen if I focused on something of my own for a long period of time. I had been saving for quite a while so I thought I'd be perfectly fine with the worst case scenario of waiting out the upcoming \"recession\" in 2023.\n\nNow I'm looking to get back into the tech industry (full stack or backend services mainly) and I do technically meet the requirements for *many* roles. But with the immense competition in the current market, I don't stand out as the \"best pick\" on paper no matter what (in my opinion).\n\nThus I'd like to ask: **Have you gone through a similar experience before? How did you navigate back into your former career OR how did you pivot to a new career?**\n\nAs bonus details:\n\n* It's not monetarily viable for me to wait out the market until, say, next year\n* In addition, I've made neat advancements in the game dev space but there aren't many relevant doors in that direction (yet) and I'd like to focus this post on the main career topic\n* Furthermore, perhaps I just need a reminder that I should reach out to my former network (even if I haven't spoken to them in years whatsoever) and/or keep massively cold applying the entire time\n* Finally, I may just be overthinking things.

So I decided to return last year and the market was already very bad.\n\nSo here is what I did that I think really helped me to get a new job, and actually a really good one. I treated my year in this game dev path, as a Software Engineer position, and created good and true bullet points out of this year working on the game, everything I learned, all the challenges, and so on. \n\nI was leading the engineering of a game, I had to implement design patterns, take architecture decisions, handle the priority of the tasks and really manage the project. I had to manage the building of this game in multiple platforms with a CI/CD pipeline and release it to Steam.\n\nAfter I wrote down all of this, I also created a page of my game development company on LinkedIn, and put that I was working in as a self employed software engineer (no, not as a founder or CTO, as I wanted a software engineer position) in this company.\n\nThen on the interviews actually this helped me sometimes, as all the managers that interviewed me were very curious about what I did, the challenges and how I solved then.\n\nOf course, it's very different when you already have 10+ years, because you can show you know what you're talking about, and you have other experiences in the CV to support it.\n\nBut dealing with it as a normal software engineer position helped me a lot.",

I knew a few people who made a killing at having a few contract jobs going at the same time, so I thought it would help with my massive anxiety holding onto leadership positions.

      "Seems like you are missing an entire paragraph (or 20) about what your startup company would actually *make.*",
      "I personally havent done this but know quite a few colleagues who have. They usually fall in two major categories\n\n1. The colleague wants to start their own business which is very similar to what their current employer does (not same because why would you solve a problem where the solution already exists but could be a niche, for example the current employer offers their solution only to enterprises but nothing exists for small to medium business). Anyway, all the colleague can do is think and noodle over it because any work done on their venture could directly violate their agreement with the current employer. In that case, they make a plan, make a few phone calls and then quit their job cold turkey. The reason is that they dont need to study the industry, theyve already worked on it. They know about the problems, current solutions and the gaps. \n\n2. The colleague wants to start something totally different from what their current employer does. In this case, they start their venture in parallel to their current job ( work on it on evenings, weekends etc). This allows them to study the market, test out the waters and figure out if the business has enough promise to quit their stable job and focus on it full time. \n\nMy advice would be that if your startup is in a different space from your current industry, then dont quit your job. Work on it as a side hustle. In that case, its not a major transition for you. The moment you feel like you just arent able to keep up and working on your startup full time is going to be worth it, quit your job. \n\nAnother advice I can give is try to find a like minded cofounder who have offer skills that you dont have, if youre in tech then the co founder could be a business person. This will help you keep each other motivated and help you move faster.",
      "Stay at big tech and aim to retire early. \n\nStarting a company because you have nothing else to do sounds like a great way to fail at starting your own company.",
      "As one other mentioned, consulting or independent contracting is a pretty easy entry point.\n\nGet your accounting and legal outsourced NOW. Do not attempt to do that stuff. Frankly, as cash flows allow, outsource everything that isn't your core competency. You'll enjoy it more and find more success.\n\nI moved into management consulting myself so I'm somewhat familiar with the hurtles of something service based. Ignore the nay sayers who appear to believe the only startups that matter are angel funded product companies. That's just one kind of business. And it's not even the majority of them.\n\nIf you do go consulting/contracting, it's all relationships. So start figuring out your linked in now. Who in your network understands what you do, trusts you, and needs (either now or in the future) your expertise? Start market sizing that.\n\nOne thing I wish I had done is add marketing to the list of outsourcing. So, again, if you can budget for that to not be your problem I would. Marketing seems to run more than legal and accounting, especially if they do website, branding, strategy and advertising.\n\nDM me if you need more brainstorming and good luck!",
      "You dont even need your own ideas or even risk with your personal money for that matter. For starters just start contracting. \n\nBuild projects for clients and if you come across a really cool idea you can whitelabel and pitch it to others. Chances are your client got the idea from someone else.\n\nI see this happening around me everywhere.\n\nOne guy did an app for an airport, now he whitelabeled the solution and has 10 airports as his clients.\n\nAnother guy did an app for a logistics company, whitelabeled it and now he has around 15 logistic companies as clients.\n\nI know it may sound unethical but as long as you don't sign a noncompete, you are good to go. \n\nEven if you sign a noncompete, there are ways around it. For example, nothing stops you from opening a company on another person's name and hire yourself as a generic consultant and run the show behind the scenes.\n\nSo just start building projects for clients as a contractor, let them spend all that money on trial and error and if they achieve success, time to open your own shop.",
      "As veteran of several startups my advice would be to work at one first before trying to start one yourself.\n\nYou could be an incredible engineer but the skill set to run a company is different. If you love to program be prepared to give that up entirely if your company becomes even moderately successful.\n\nIf you could land a director or CTO position that would give you a sense of what is needed and what gaps you have. Basically leverage your existing skill set but get really close to the CEO to see how they are running the business.\n\nAlso be prepared to have no work life balance. Some startups are able to successfully shield ICs from this lifestyle but Ive never meet anyone at C level leadership for a startup that wasnt working all the time.",
      "My second-hand experience is that being a co-founder long term means you're committing to years of wearing every single engineering hat. Then you can stay as an actual CxO and become a manager/executive who doesn't touch code but helps run the company. Or you're basically side-lined with no reports and nothing you do will be of any importance anymore since you're too awkward organizationally for the new management to want to deal with. Depending on how much stock you have you can also try partially/mostly exiting during a round of funding but then you have the risk of whomever is left f-ing you over on the remaining equity.\n\nWhich brings me to the actual question: What do you actually enjoy doing day to day?",
      "I have started my own company before, worked at two FAANG companies, and worked for other people's startups twice.\n\nDo **not** start a company just to start a company. Especially if you don't have a cofounder lined up.  Tons of work and stress with miniscule chances of renumeration. You will have to learn many new skills (around administering a company, raising capital, marketing, product design) - which is all achievable with the right partner, the right motivations, etc.  But you won't have those things if you're just doing a startup for a startup's sake and also trying to figure out a worthwhile idea at the same time.\n\nI have seen many people do a startup-for-startup's stake. I have done it myself once. It is a good way to spin your wheels, end up with no pay to show for it, and maybe even be isolated and depressed from working completely alone every day.and it amounting to zilch.\n\nI suggest working for a small startup, for a limited amount of time (18-24 months).   You will find that on paper, this makes no financial sense compared to staying at FAANG - you will be making maybe 25-50% your TCO at FAANG, in exchange for options that will 90% go to zero, and even in the upside case - probably only enough shares to make back what you would have gotten staying at FAANG. But that's not the point, you will get exposed to more of the business side and meet other people interested in startups that you might start a company with.\n\nYou should pick a company that's <10 people and ideally (I know this is annoying) working in an office instead of WFH so you can end up working with folks outside of engineering.\n\nThe second best option is: keep your job at FAANG, be disciplined about logging off at 5 every day, and afterwords, work on your startup idea.  Focus on just learning about areas that interest you (the business side, not just the tech side). Build products and - this is key- try to get users for those products by putting them in front of people, getting feedback, asking people to pay.\n\nDo some small amount of \"networking\", but don't fill up your time going to startup events with other people hooked on the idea of a startup but no concrete thing they are doing. Instead, create your product first, and be showing it off to other people until you find someone you click with.\n\nBe very very careful about your employer not owning your IP here; don't you dare ever use your work machine or anything else owned by your employer for your project, and don't compete with your employer's products. If your employer is a FAANG company, the areas they compete in are so very broad, this might constrain you significantly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEither one of these two paths will give you the chance to learn about startups, find someone to work with, and figure out what business you're really passionate about building.  You will have a direction to work in, instead of just wandering. And you'll have someone to work with and bounce ideas off of, instead of completely isolating yourself.  And you won't be starting the clock on drawing down your savings in the meantime. Once the idea and team is set, then you will be ready to start a company - and you'll be much better positioned to raise outside capital for your company.\n\nSome useful resources:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFour Steps to the Epiphany by Steve Blank - on customer discovery\n\nDesign for Hackers by David Kadavy - on learning design, since you'll have to own that aspect of what you do now too.\n\nYC Startup School: [https://www.startupschool.org/](https://www.startupschool.org/)",

      "Unless you have a very good idea of what the company will actually do, an MVP with some sort of customer base, or some sort of steady foundation. Starting with \"own startup\" is setting yourself up for a difficult time. You should also consider **why** you want to own a startup, since you might find that you don't really enjoy it or are not very good at it.\n\nOwning a startup involves much more than just SWE. Being a high performing dev in a medium/large business and owning a startup are two very different skill areas. Similarly, a lot of startup owners might not actually make the cut in a FAANG environment to begin with. You would do well to remind yourself that most startup owners could not do what you currently do and are not startup owners by choice, and also that the overwhelming majority of startups fail.\n\nInstead, a better way to go about it is to get into an early stage startup with someone with some solid business acumen and who can handle things outside of dev, with the aim of being the CTO side of things.\n\nYou should also consider that given your most recent experience is in medium/large enterprises, that you are going to be in a very different tech environment at a startup.",
      "You are starting to realize that a job is just a job. Working for someone else is very \"task oriented\" no matter if its FAANG, or even someone else's startup. It gets boring.\n\nIf you are at a point where you feel like you want to make a difference (and you don't have to worry about a paycheck in the next few years or so), starting your gig can be amazing. You won't make any money, in fact, you will be losing money. At least, the first few years. But if you can figure out a business model, that is your first stride towards financial independence. Some people choose to raise money during this phase bec they can't afford losing money during the R&D phase. But my suggestion is to not raise money if you can afford it.\n\nEven if you make $15K/year with your gig, you have it made, because you can essentially scale your business when you are ready to move at a faster pace. And the best part is, you are not beholden to ANYONE. You don't have to live in Silicon Valley, you can live where YOU want.\n\nI will warn you though that even making $15K will be insanely difficult that first year or two. If you aren't business minded, start looking for a biz cofounder now. Don't scoff at the idea of a non tech founder either. The business side of things is what will bring in the money. Tech can always be outsourced, but at a high cost. However, contrary to belief, you save a ton of money by keeping things inhouse. The reason why people think outsourcing is cheap, is due to leaders not understanding that less is more. 2 highly paid well vetted \"inhouse\" engineers cost less than a team of 15 outsourced engineers. And the 2 highly paid engineers will output much better code at a faster rate. You just need a good tech leader. That tech leader can be you.",
      "Two times I started my own companies with friends. (Both e-learning) The first time was with us having side gigs/still studying and really small. Actually I learned a lot, although we actually had customers revenue was super small. (At the best times maybe 300  a month) Eventually we did a relaunch, got new customers, nicer Website but we would have had to invest more time and money to get to the next level. But everybody had full-time jobs eventually and got a bit side-tracked.\n\nThe other time it was more serious, working on it full-time, we got into an Accelerator program and also a little funding. However we weren't really aligned with the goals, lots of awful discussions happened and eventually gave up.\n\nMy main learnings from this: either start alone or make sure you get super well along with the people. (The companies from the accelerator that still exist today/got acquired were getting along very well also during times when things didn't work out so well.) If you see red flags in the beginning, don't ignore them but GTFO and go for a normal job.\n\nThat said, it's obviously a lot of effort. During the time there were good books about this, e.g. from Steve Blank (Startup Owner's Manual).

Later I shot up to the top of the board not from my programming skills but due to becoming a requirements gatherer and co-product owner.  The other devs hated meetings but I loved to be part of the decision process.  Often I took on my managers workload.  From there I did professional services for a long time.  That led to some architect roles, which taught me a lot about corporate politics.  Then I became a tech lead, which was extremely enjoyable.  Currently I am a team lead on a specialized team full of senior and staff level people so we have had two to four team leads.  I work directly with end users, coordinating new projects, maintenance, accounting, and research.  I really love it.\n\nIf you want to be more people focused, talk to customers.

Now, add to that someone not doing their job properly, someone else forgetting to get back to you because everyone has more stuff to do, or a dice roll of bad luck and I can guarantee you that finding a day where I can \"quietly coding all -the working- day\" is as rare as a company that actually does agile right.\n\nI don't know, man. The (technical) path in my company goes up to senior software engineer, then lead engineer, then principal software engineer, then solutions architect (more or less), and with each step is less coding and more talking and figuring out stuff at high level. The business-oriented path has even less technical stuff and more client-talking.\n\nI can't really say I've been in a place in which I felt solitary, but then again, I like building things, being left as much alone as it can be while working.

In order to be good at it, you need to talk regularly to your reports and to people from other teams. So you're not isolated.\n\n(* performance = potential - interferences, so to increase performance, work on increase your report potentiel throught training and mentoring, and remove interferences, helping them getting enough room to get the job done)\n\nAnother way could be technical coach or trainer : help other get better engineers. It will help you get better while you're doing it as an added bonus. You can do that in your org : organize meetups, training sessions, code katas, talks (internal and guest speakers) etc etc. I did this in several companies and it was fun, but after a while, explaining the same 20 years old stuff for the hundredth time got old, so i switched again.\n\nPMing is like a whole new job, that you'd have to start from scratch. The good news is that there is as many definition of what a PM is as there is companies, so you'll find something that suits you. My only advice there would be that some specialties are dead ends : once you're typecast, you'll do this kind of work for life. Like \"technical PM\" or \"data PM\". If you like it though, that's cool, because there are, even now, more openings than candidates in these specialities (because nobody want to do it).",

I'd say it's the exact opposite of that. Developers work best when collaborating with each other and outside people.\n\nI also managed people, and I can tell you that I could be the best tech person in the company, but as soon as I partially switched to management - I a very bad manager.

Im looking for a change into the realm of game development using C++ and the unreal engine. \n\nWhat Im looking for is to see if others did this transition? How much time did it take you to get over the unreal learning curve (C++ was one of the first languages I learned)? Was it hard to get a Job? Did your previous experience help you with getting better pay than someone who is fresh from college? Would you do it again?\n\nI Guess if you have experience in this area please share",
    "comments": [
      "Knowing C++ is not the issue. Gamedev is an incredibly technical field with very niche topics you have to be familiar with. For example, I don't know anyone outside of game devs that work with octrees and GPU programming. There's a lot of different things you can work on as a programmer from gameplay, tools, graphics, networking, etc. \nThe competition for entry level is extremely stiff. You'll more or less be restarting your career and competing with new grads that have been pursuing it intensely for half a decade. I can only speak from what I've seen as a hobbyist game dev for the last 8 years.\nTry to make a game in unreal first. Something small.",
      "Game development chews through fresh grads who are prepared to work all the hours for no money just because they like games. Then most of them grow up and get more sustainable jobs. A few stick around and become seniors who still get paid peanuts.\n\nSince you're fresh to the industry, you won't be a senior due to the niche skills, so basically everything will be bad. Unless you're prepared for that, probably better to accept that you missed the boat here.",
      "Rule #1.  Never, ever, ever write code that blocks on I/O.  All I/O must be non-blocking.\n\nI emphasize this because it's the #1 difference I see from game industry and non-game industry developers.  Non-game-industry folks throw out long blocking calls like it's nothing.\n\nEdit:  To be clear, I transitioned the other way, from games to tech (and back, and now kind of in the middle)",
      "Game companies are desperate for talent, but cheap talent and the average skill level has never been lower.\n\nDo some game project on your own, learn C++ well and good luck.\n\nAlso decide what king of videogames programmer you want to be.\n\nHonestly transitioning to game development in 2023 is absolute bonkers to me but if this is what you want I wish you the best.",
      "I transitioned from gamedev to full stack engineer.\n\nMy reasoning (after 6 years in the game industry):\n- A decent game typically took 2 years or more to complete. Like even the MVP alone would take 6-8 months to materialise from concept to showcase-able state.\n- The work feels like never ending, due to the long dev time. A feature is never really done. Once you add a new feature, it'll surely affects the rest of the game system.\n- The pay was not that great. I mean, I don't blame them, a game took forever to make anyway. By the time it came out, if you're lucky, it became a hit, the company make money, you get raise and bonus; unfortunately, most of the time it doesn't become a hit and it may take forever for the company to recoup the dev budget.\n- Work life balance (if you're into those things) are non existent. With all the features and bug fixes you have to work on, you just can't catch a break. But if you're the type that loves a good challenge every day, gamedev can totally give you that.\n- Finding a job is excruciatingly hard. Because of how complicated a gamedev is -- takes forever, low profitability, gets harder to make the more ambitious the game designer is -- most companies prefer to hire seniors and often don't offer to train newbies.\n\nSince transitioned to a full stack engineer 7 years ago, I have never been happier writing codes for a living. The challenge may not be as high or fun as a gamedev, at least I can get better pay and achieve better work life balance.\n\nEdit: Change spelling and add years since transitioned.",
      "It can be a cool career move if youre excited by the technical challenges unique to game development.\n\nKeep in mind though:\n\n- You will have no creative control. Even if you think the game is terrible shovelware, you will likely have approximately zero input into improving the game outside of technical issues.\n- Game development timelines can be *long*. You might get hired to work on a AAA game today that wont be released until 2030. Understand the implications of this and the impact on your motivation.",
      "I did frontend and backend work for both game and non game development. Game dev for many years on different companies doing different things. The thing that strikes me the most about game dev is how little engineering is regarded in the field. You're a puppet for product managers and artists to do their bidding, as fast as possible and as cheaply as possible. No one cares about good engineering, it's not what gets the money.\n\nDid that for many years and moved to more stable technical industries. Never looked back.",
      "I did. I went to school for it but did Software Dev for years... then finally was offered a role at an award winning studio this year. I love it... great culture, great pay. Makes me so much happier.",
      "I do gamedev as a hobby.\n\nThe problem with gamedev is that it's a very crowded market with high market competition. The wages are not very good because there is a large labor pool driven by passionate individuals.\n\nEvery week roughly 200 apps are released on steam! In fact the distribution of successful games is quite skewed. It's actually similar to YouTube or Spotify where a disproportionate amount of attention goes to the top games. The truly top games have budgets in the hundreds of millions, have more mocap and voice acting than full seasons of television shows, and have legions of artists, many outsourced.\n\nIn contrast, areas like cloud computing, web services, and crud apps are an order of magnitude easier to build and in high demand since virtually all businesses need support in these areas. The labor market is also intensely skewed by the tech monopolies which all will take a 30% cut of whatever you create.\n \nIn the next 5 years, I believe advances in AI will touch even more industries, and in the next 10 years it's possible that gamedev skills become more relevant if the Internet becomes more AR/XR oriented. Until then, gamedev as a job is not great",
      "As I get older, I'm starting to feel this is my only life and that I should try, even if it's a pay cut",
      "I'm surprised nobody's mentioned this yet: consider industries that are adjacent to games, ones that use some of the same skills but don't have the significant compensation and work/life balance issues that game development tends to have. Examples include simulations, educational games, visualization, A/V systems, gaming (as in casino games), entertainment, events & special effects, remote collaboration software, immersive media, theme park equipment, aircraft instrumentation, medical visualization... there's plenty of niches that use some or all of the same skills and technologies that you'd use for game development. \n\nSome example jobs from a cursory LinkedIn search:\n\n- [Software Developer, 3D Render Engine Development](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3712731212/) at Daktronics, who make those huge video displays for stadiums and performance venues\n- [Interactive Simulation Designer/Developer, K-12 Science and Math Education](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3650162364/) at ExploreLearning\n- [Software Engineer, FigJam](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3536508032/) at Figma, building remote collaboration tools\n- [Scientific Software Engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3663863855/) at ERT Inc, working on modeling space weather and RF processing\n- [Engine Software Engineer, Generalist](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3641792240/) at KittyCAD, developing tooling for hardware designers\n\nDon't underestimate your current skills, either. You can absolutely build a high-quality real-time 3D game for the browser using JS/TS + WebGL or soon WebGPU, optionally augmented with some WASM here and there. I previously worked in browser-based educational software. We weren't that high-performance (we used the HTML5 Canvas interface rather than WebGL, for example) but there was still *way* more low-level code being written than at a typical JS job.\n\nIt's not JavaScript's fault that most programs written in JS don't prioritize performance (often correctly). You just have to write it a bit differently, with a mindset a bit closer to writing in a lower-level language like C++.",
      "I went the opposite way and it wasn't terribly hard to leave. AAA left a bad taste in my mouth and I don't think I'll ever go back to game dev because of the dismal(comparatively) pay, long hours, and management breathing down your neck to hit milestones. I'd be hesitant to leave web for games, if you want to work on highly performant stuff there's embedded or similar, if you do transition I hope you enjoy it more than I did.",
      "Significantly different and the math/low level programming matters. C++ is a different beast in itself and its not as transferable coming from those languages compared to C, Rust, or similar.\n\nIts all possible but your background and experience will make a huge difference. You can definitely do it but more than anything Id note the reason I steered away was not my skill set but the industry, how it functions, and extreme competition.\n\nNetworking, game physics, and lighting in particular are notoriously difficult areas to learn with the level at which they are building in higher tier companies. There are engines like Unity and Unreal but they dont negate writing complex logic within them even though the abstractions/APIs can be very useful.\n\nSuggestion - take a few online game dev and low level programming classes to get a feel for it. There will be a ton of foreign concepts to you more than likely.",
      "As a developer, I love playing a game now and then, but I think game development is one of the worst markets to work in, you have to be really passionate about it to go there.",
      "You're better off building an indy game as a side hustle.",
      "To have a good career in games with a good salary you should focus on game technology, not so much games themselves. You can still be an engine programmer at an indie game studio, it's not only for AAA studios. You get all the benefits of having really fun coworkers and seeing your work in the game, etc. Anything obnoxiously complicated like physics and graphics is where it's at :) There's a huge demand for people who can modify and enhance Unreal engine specifically.",
      "I honestly can't think of anything worse. The industry is famous for brutal crunch cycles and low pay. And if by some miracle you actually get the game out on time you'll probably be laid off or spend the next 6 months being screamed at by capital G Gamers about \"netcode\" and \"optmisation\". And you better hope there is nothing \"woke\" in the game, or you're in deep shit.\n\nIt sounds miserable.",
      "This is for experienced devs my man. \n\nMost of us learned early game dev is a brutal grind for not nearly enough money haha. \n\nThe career translation goes the other way most times.",
      "You gotta become a systems engineer, which is daunting.\n\nJust make a lot of stuff. If you have a good time, its for you.",
      "Twice the work half the pay (exaggeration but still)",
      "With the tech stack you have experience in, you can secure really good pay with a chill work environment, low output requirement etc.\n\nBy moving into game dev you can expect much lower pay, longer hours, you become more expendable in the eyes of employers and much higher requirements in your output.\n\nThis is why you should stay where you are now professionally and only do game dev at a hobby basis.\n\nFYI I never worked in game development, but considered the same move as you prior to doing the research..",
      "So, it kind of depends on what you mean by \"game development.\" I'm assuming you mean mean becoming a gameplay programmer based on wanting to use C++ with UE. My experience in trying this for a few years is that knowing C++ well isn't enough to get your foot in the door. Most places won't touch you unless your resume has professional gamedev experience, or at least some hobbyist experience with published games. \n\nWhen I actually did get interviews, they were either pretty ridiculous and intense compared to what I'm used to, or I managed to get through the process and was offered a really low salary compared to doing web stuff. I'm sure some people would be fine taking a salary cut to work on games and to escape web, but to me it felt like a huge step backwards, especially for jobs that are super volatile due to the release cycle of games. I would just stick to being a hobbyist myself, but I'm sure there are experienced people who do end up transitioning and it works out for them.",
      "I'm in a similar mindset at the moment. I've always loved to of got into the gaming industry but now I've made my way up to management now. But I'm still going to try, regardless, mostly part time indie development but if you really want it, go for it. Just don't cut off your current income too soon",
      "I would suggest you research the area well before transitioning, or even before starting learning whatever you feel you need to be able to transition.\n\nI've heard that game development is not that good of an environment. Look it up, try to talk to people in companies you are aiming for, go on Glassdoor, etc.",
      "This was always what I wanted to do, but honestly it's easier and pays better to do regular software engineering",
      "I've been learning unreal engine for 3 months approx. I would suggest use library Genesis, look up \"blueprints visual scripting for unreal engine 5\". Go through the book chapter by chapter. It is amazing as a tool and you'll feel so accomplished once you understand it.\n\n\nFor game dev tho, there are so many avenues to pursue. Like you can get a job, just doing materials, or animations, or story line, game idea. You can get crowd funding. I've seen one surprising game get 1 million in funding lol. I think game dev is an extremely versatile and growing avenue. \n\n\nYou just have to stray away from all these boring game modes, with single challenges. \"kill monster, level up, repeat\". Or \"pass level, upgrade, repeat forever\" . I really think there is more that could be done with games. To enhance the game play.\n\nOne tactic I've learned is \"not just one problem\". Any player interaction, fight, battle should have an additional problem going on besides just the monster they're fighting. Like growing shadows on the field that do damage to the player, or floating orbs that can connect with the monster and grant power ups to the monster, etc.\n\nOne series on YouTube I really enjoy is \"worst mmos ever\" by John Hayes strife. It's a really awesome way to see how different games were made. View old games and see unique gameplay aspects, or ideas. I think the most beneficial thing to making games is to see as many games as possible."

    "content": "Background:  20 years as a coder.  15 years at my 1st company, 5 years at my 2nd.\n\n\n\n1st company:  QA team is great.  Their job is primarily manual testing.  They knew the product inside and out.  They knew the companys domain knowledge better than the devs.  They catch things the devs never considered and are a tremendous asset to this company. Over the years they adopted automated testing.  I thought it was a useful but costly process to create and maintain automated tests.\n\n2nd company: Quarter of the revenue and employee size as 1st company.  QA is insistent on writing automated tests.  Theyre made up of people who have made it no secret that they want to transition into full-time coders.  The QA team misses things (of course, so did us coders, definitely not putting the blame on them).  They do not catch as many bugs as 1st companys QA team.  They do not take on learning companys domain knowledge. Theyre not as good as the QA team from my 1st company, which is frustrating.\n\n\n\n\nAn example of what we went through recently is a new QA hire named, lets say, Percy.  All Percy wanted to do is code and not do manual tests.  Percy wasnt good at either.  Percy kept bugging the dev team with programming questions.  Our Product Owner was fed up with Percys performance that the PO even did manual testing since PO couldnt even trust Percy. Our Engineering Manager finally told Percy to focus more on manual testing and devote 10% of their time to writing automated tests.  Percy quit.\n\n\n\n\nMy question for this sub is:  are we hiring the wrong people or is my opinion of a companys QA department wrong/outdated?  1st company QA hires came from more of a tech support background.  2nd company QA hires come from more of a background in CS.  Our CTO has a big interest in automated testing, but I think its a Sunk Cost Fallacy.  The automated tests are awesome when they catch things, but its rare and IMHO not worth the cost so I do not share our CTOs opinion of them.\n\n=====================\n\nEDIT:  Thank you so much for all of the comments.  Definitely walking away from this post with a different, better understanding of things.  Some more context and conclusions:\n\n* Everyone's assumption that QA is junior is 100% correct, including the QA lead.\n* Devs write unit and integration tests.  QA write automated tests in the form of E2E and Selenium tests.\n* Automated tests are important.  So is doing new, exploratory manual testing, which is what I'm not seeing from QA, so the devs need to do more of that work.\n* Never thought about manual and automated testing as 2 separate jobs.  That makes so much sense!\n* I think my conclusion that automated tests are a Sunk Cost Fallacy **at this current company** is because we're a very small company.  We just don't have the budget to fund proper automated testing.\n* I need to not use QA as a crutch and think about how to improve the quality of my output.  I was spoiled at my 1st company.",
    "comments": [
      "> 1st company QA hires came from more of a tech support background.  2nd company QA hires come from more of a background in CS.\n\nA lot of companies start new/entry level hires in QA in order to learn the product domain knowledge, with the general expectation that as they gain experience, most of them will move into development roles.\n\nAnd let's be honest; most people who earn a degree in Computer Science aren't interested in an entire career spent clicking buttons in a browser or application window.",
      "Industry trends have been to cut costs. This includes spending on QA and on training and on loyalty. As you noted, everyone in QA wants to be on the engineering team. Why is that? My guess is at your new and smaller company that engineering gets paid more and has better job security than QA. As far as I know there aren't QA boot camps or degrees aimed at QA.",
      "I think the challenge is the scope of work. I have automation engineers whose goals are getting us to cd. The role is not to be the only ones catching issues. Their job is to help automate validation that changes dont break finished features. I expect the developer, the developer reviewer, the ui/ux reviewer, the qa, the qa reviewer, and the po to each validate that the code does what it is supposed to. Qa is there as part of our cd process, not to be the catch everything so developers can sling shit code and see what sticks. They are great but your process and ownership of whom should be testing is off in my opinion.\n\nWe run 5 devs to 3 qa engineers. I find its harder to find automation engineers than devs. As for people like percy, just try to find people interested in helping reach the cd part of ci/cd. Qa may do regression tests if you arent at cd but that should be the goal.",
      "sounds like percy specifically didnt actually want to do QA.\n\nthis is definitley a hiring problem. they should hire people who actually want to do the job, not some other job.\n\nQA is actually a very important role. my company pays our QA people quite well specifically so that they dont feel bad about being QA.\n\nto be fair, if QA paid like crap I too would try very hard to transition out of QA.",
      "My perspective as a QA dude who probably does 80/20 automation/manual:\n\nThe automation isn't to catch bugs. It's to catch regressions. Not everything must be automated. Some things don't make sense to automate, but - so long as there's feature development on the product - the regression suite should be growing with it. \n\nI don't automate anything that I haven't manually tested first. They're part of the same process. How can I tell the automation what to expect if I don't know what to expect? While I do some exploratory testing, a lot of it just a consequence of being a curious person and prodding the product manager to be very clear about the behavior they want in the acceptance criteria. \n\nSide-note: I kind of hate the \"QA breaks the app\" trope. We don't break it. We just figure out what was already broken as often as we can and then bring it up. While I've got opinions, if the PM says \"it's a feature, not a bug\" and is willing it put it in writing so I can cover my ass, then it may not get kicked back to your TODO list.",
      "A lot of people, including developers, have a skewed and often inaccurate view of testing and automated testing.\n\nFor example, automated testing is not the same as testing. Automated testing is not likely to catch bugs. That's not really its job. It's job is to provide a safety net, a canary in the coalmine, and to provide confidence.\n\nTesting also isn't really about catching defects, though it does that quite well. Testing is about articulating the state of the product/project so that someone can make informed business decisions. Testing is about pulling all the various testing activities together and articulating the risk to the product/project/business. Testing is about identifying risk.\n\nRisk is highly contextual. So the approach to testing should be highly contextual.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpeaking generally, on most projects I would want to see a multi-pronged approach:\n\n* Developer testing at the unit level. Ideally augmented by mutation testing.\n* Code reviews or pair/mob programming.\n* Some manual \"checking\", done either by developers or QA personnel.\n* More exploratory testing.\n* Automated tests focusing on integration points, in sane amounts.\n* End to end automation of fundamental workflows, also in sane amounts.\n* Automated performance & load testing as necessary.\n* Security testing as necessary.\n* And then, to actually put the QA in QA, some sort of feedback loop to identify weaknesses and cover them.\n\nAnd, as stated, tune all of this to the product and business.\n\nNow, as to your examples, for sure automated testing now represents a back door into a developers role and you are going to encounter people who are using it as such. I think that comes with the territory.",
      "It's not a particularly popular opinion, but I think really good, really *effective* automated tests are harder to build than actual code half the time.\n\nHowever, this reality clashes with the tech class system. Developers are high up and QA is low on the totem pole. I've yet to hear of a single company, anywhere that pays QA as much as developers. Once or twice Ive heard of \"SDET\"s who are treated as equivalent, but it still feels like something more in the realm of myth than reality.\n\nThis also has the side effect that many developers look down on writing tests and wont do it (\"isnt this what interns are for???\").\n\nId bet pretty good money your company is hiring QA people and paying market. Youre not hiring SDET people and paying developer money. Then youre giving the really hard, technical work to the guy who is 40% cheaper than everybody else and wondering where it all went wrong.\n\nThe economics of automated testing are a bit complicated. Sometimes it's worth it, sometimes it's not and calculating if it'll be worth it is often *hard* so people usually go on gut instinct. It's complicated by the fact that you can often get really good manual QA for cheap (best manual QA I ever worked with was an ex hairdresser) but good automation expertise requires $$$.\n\nHowever, cheaping out on it (which most companies do) is a *guaranteed* false economy.",
      "If QA is missing a lot of bugs, then so are the developer-written tests. Sometimes that's unavoidable, the bugs are exclusively in the full stack or they're simply extreme edge cases that people are naturally going to miss.\n\nSometimes, it means there's a lack of proper code ownership from the developers.\n\nIdeally, QA should have enough time to automate everything they're testing, as they're doing their manual testing. Things are rarely ideal, but if a QA can only spend 10% of their time automating, then there's no point in automating at all. They're going to constantly be too far behind to ever catch up.\n\nI don't agree with you on automated testing no catching things - to me that sounds like an immature test suite with poor definitions. Could be QA's fault, could the the developers, but most likely it's the company supplying insufficient QA resources to the tasks at hand.\n\nA good automated test suite can verify a full regression in under an hour for a system that takes days to do full regression on manually. That's invaluable when dealing with complex systems with hundreds of screen variations and dozens of user types. If your app is extremely straight forward, automated tests might be largely unnecessary. Most apps as they mature benefit from them quite a bit.",
      "QA and finding bugs is a separate mindset from being a good coder. Good testers try to understand and break the code.  They think of scenarios that users can do based on how things work that coders don't even think of.\n\nIt's not code shall do X, so test if X is possible.  That's a basic test.  You think about how X interplays with the rest of the system and see if you can break it.",
      "Having done manual QA, automated QA, and now being a software engineer, I think devs should own quality. \n\nThere should be no dedicated automated QA and no to minimal dedicated manual QA, at least at small to medium sized companies.\n\nAt first, you'll spend a bit more time manually testing things yourself, but as time goes on, without the crutch, you'll start baking quality in from the get-go. You'll spend less time context shifting when they get back to you a week later about a bug.",
      "I don't think you are wrong. There should be a lot of manual testing along with automated testing.  There are so many things that require domain knowledge and manual testing that automated testing will never catch.\n\nPerhaps, as you partially state, the company's mandate for the QA team is wrong or is allowing them to deviate from what a normal QA team is responsible for.  IMO, that is the wrong direction and it will show when product ships/deploys.",
      "I think its just really hard to hire good QA. The barrier to entry is much lower than it is for devs, but doing QA well is not easy. There are absolutely 10x QA out there and it makes a huge difference working with them.",
      "QA is an entirely different mindset from development, so any time someone's goal is to be a developer I pass on them for a QA role. I spent most of my career on the testing side of things myself (bailing only because a centralized testing group needing a manager is well on its way out). \n\nIf you don't have that fundamental underlying tester mentality, then you're not going to get good test coverage. If you automate things you'll get through the tests faster but you won't find any more problems. I've also even seen just shitty tests which someone went and automated which was painful because they just had faster shit rather than good testing. \n\nI have absolutely nothing against automation, but the kind of tester who actually enjoys manual testing is, in my opinion, more likely to be a better tester. and resource They should have an innate curiosity about how things work, how they fit together, how things can go sideways and be a very divergent thinker. I would 100% prefer hiring from a support background because they have experience with what customers do and spend a lot of their time troubleshooting. The same skills used in troubleshooting are invaluable in testing - seeing something weird and poking around it to figure it out. Those who want to be developers tend more to be builders. They see how things should be and build them. Testers go around shaking everything because they're curious what would happen if they did. \n\nA really good tester? They'll sit in on design discussions and will start breaking your design before anyone even writes a line of code - when it is the absolute cheapest to fix. That's not the sort of skill set one can replace with automation. That kind of tester is very hard to find and only harder and harder as time goes on as the role of tester is dying now (whole other rant)",
      "Basically I don't think you're wrong *as such* but your embedded assumption seems to be that software quality happens in the qa team.\n\nAlternatively, software quality can happen at the strategic, product, and engineering levels. In the case of your first company, I assume that the QA team where largely doing invisible work forcing product and engineering to sort themselves out so that manual testing could happen.\n\nSecondly manual exploratory testing + scripted manual testing by a clued in QA engineer will tend to expose the unconsidered edge cases.\n\nOne good solution is to give the QA team the same job titles and pay scales as the dev teams, then hire people who can explain how a QA team fits into a good organisation. Make clear to the recruiters that you are in fact interested in people whose current job title is some variant of \"QA Peon\" and current software engineers with a demonstrated interest in QA, and not just looking to hoover up some software engineers who have never done QA before.\n\nAnother solution is to basically have a small automated test team whose main function is to say \"This isn't sufficiently specified to write tests what do you mean\" and have them ask the devs what tests they've already written to compensate for the difficulty of automated testing.\n\nAnother solution is to hire people with QA titles to be junior product managers so that testing resides with product, and have no separate QA function. Leave it to engineering to figure out how to catch mistakes.\n\nA fourth solution is to have a product function that doesn't test and leave testing up to engineering to figure out.",
      "I've met people (devs and QA) who think automation is the goal in itself, not a tool to achieve x, which I think is bad and the problem with Company 2. X in this case would be regression.\n\nAutomation is not sentient AI that catches bugs, it's meant to speed up a manual process that someone knows. If no one knows what they're automating, how do they know they have a stable product (apart from users telling you, hey you broke this)?\n\nEssentially, I disagree that it's useless, but Company 2 is doing it wrong. As for the hiring part, if QA positions are lower-pay, lower-respect, you're-supposed-to-grow-out-of-it type of roles, no wonder people want to get away. Check how your company treats QA.",
      "The problem is that manual QA and automated QA are essentially different fields.\n\nTeam QA 2 and literally anyone in that company should have domain knowledge. That's non negotionable.\n\nThat said a responsibility of modern QA teams is to automate tests to make development more efficient and less costly.\n\nSo that is going to be a big focus for them.\n\n\nAlso the idea that modern QA isn't effectively an programmer job is close minded. Fuck off with that kind of out dated thinking. It's typically called **Software engineer** in test for a reason.",
      "TL;DR my preferences:\n\n* *Developers* write UAT tests against the app's top API.\n* A smoke test as a super integration test, written by DevOps.  Integration tests that just check external configuration, written by DevOps\n* Fewer QA.  QA activities should be more advanced, like exploratory and load testing.  QA may act as a BA.\n\nIMO, the industry is wrong-minded about QA and automated testing, including the two example companies.  I've worked at companies exactly like that.\n\nI'm **not a fan of E2E automated tests** (which usually means browser-driven tests, e.g. selenium/cypress).  They are **high effort, low impact**.  I think only a tiny few should exist as \"smoke\" tests, just to make sure everything is wired together correctly.  Smoke tests should be able to run against production.\n\nI think **developers should write UAT tests against a thin abstraction** over the top-level system API (i.e. service or controller classes), with a mocked or in-memory backend database.  (This thin layer directly matches the user story, and is easy for non-programmers to understand, similar to PageObjects.)  Most of these tests should be written by the developers, and should be reasonably fast.  They are **low effort, high impact**.  This is where most testing should occur.\n\n**QA automation testers should be** ***real*** **programmers** (not promoted QA), that write smoke tests (as above), and integration tests (just to make sure external APIs work).   Tbh, I think this should be a part of the DevOps role, not a specialized QA role.\n\nQA people should make sure that all of the above is happening well, and to do more advanced types of testing, like manual exploratory testing, load/stress/scalability testing, accessibility testing, penetration testing, etc.  QA might have BA responsibilities, such as listing out UAT use-cases in the user story/ticket.  Really, there should be very few QA personnel, but they should be highly skilled at detecting and preventing hard-to-find issues.",
      "A perfect QA should help automate the most boring parts of their job. Those happy path tests that they perform every single time? Those should be automated. They should also perform exploratory manual testing. This isn't just repeating the automated tests in a manual fashion. It's playing the role of a clueless user. \"What if I follow the steps out of order? What if I change my last name to Zrchrnd? What if my password is a series of unicorn emojis?\".\n\nWhen helping define requirements, it's cool to include that perfect QA. Their mind is trained to ask questions we don't think of, and they can help identify predictable misuse of your features.\n\nI've only ever worked with one perfect QA. I've seen some very good, very creative QA's who had no coding skill and were only button pushers. They were great, and they only got better as we automated the boring parts of their jobs. \n\nIn short, I disagree with you on the value of automated tests. I think automating the most common test scenarios helps you get more out of a strong QA like the ones you had in company A.",
      ">I thought it was a useful but costly process to create and maintain automated tests.\n\nMy company has no QA at all, all testing is automated. Unit tests, integ tests, full CI/CD. We have way fewer bugs than my last company's products where every team had dedicated QA and all sorts of intensive manual testing efforts. I recall entire sprints spent dedicating everyone in the software department to nothing but QA before a new release. I guarantee you that was far more expensive than just making every dev write tests to go along with their code.",
      "No one wants to get stuck doing manual QA forever. That's a sure fire way to kill your career and end up going nowhere. Some people like it though, but they're pretty rare. And even those folks are automating lots of their tests. \n\nAlso, you should be writing unit tests and leverage automated testing in your critical paths at minimum, that way you don't have to manually QA everything. Leave manual QA to areas where automated testing isn't robust enough yet, but move those trouble areas towards automated testing.",
      "You're hiring the wrong people.\n\nDon't hire (all) CS people for QA. I worked at a medical device company for a while: who were half our QA people? Former ICU nurses who had burned out on patient care. \n\nAnother company we hired out of the electronics tech program at the local tech college (lots of connecting devices and wiring cables to test that stuff)\n\nYour Devs should be the ones writing unit tests. Your QA should be doing the Verification and Validation step. Yes, some of that should be automated (mostly regression tests) if possible but nothing beats a knowledgeable person in the seat in front of the product.",
      "A hiring problem but also an **industry** problem: people don't realize that proper \\_testing\\_ is a craft!  \nThere should not be a divide between \"manual\" (translated to \"boring and stupid\") or \"automation\" (translated to \"fast, cheap and smart\") because non of that is true.  \nGood testers are **quality investigators**: they probe the product to analyze its behavior to determine whether it is \\_off\\_ in the broadest sense possible. Good testers use, and know, many tools for that. But it all starts with the most important one: their BRAIN.\n\n\"Automated testing\" is a contradiction in terms. You can't automate for the things you don't know are a problem until you discovered them.",
      "Over the past 8 years or so the mantra has become \"Manual testing is bad/slow/not scalable, We must have 100% automation for reusable testing!\".   This has been adopted by many CTOs and pushed down to organizations.   IMHO of 27 years in the field, manual QAs are normally VERY good at knowing the system and finding edge cases.  Automation engineers are OK at coding (many of them are entry level and/or can not cut it as a full time DEV) and are not great at the skills needed to know a system to find good test uses cases.\n\nMy argument and what I have found to work in practice:  a 50/50ish split.  Manual testers that do what they are good at and identify edge cases in a system.  Feed the Automation engineers the specfic use cases so they can go off and script out the automation in Selenium (or whatever tool they choose).  \n\nThis is my stragety I try to deploy as a director of engineering in my organization.",
      "The industry trend is going from having separate QA teams to cross-functional teams with end-to-end responsibility for production.",
      "It seems like most of the industry misses the mark on what QA is; they confuse it with QC (quality control). QA is the whole process in which you make a quality product. QC is the random sampling of the assembly line to try understand your defect rate and perhaps catch the odd rat before it hits a customer. This is not your primary defence... you should have defence in layers.\n\nYou can't just add a ton of testers and expect your quality to go up. Even if they catch a ton of problems, that feedback loop is awful and you'll see it blow up like in the games industry all the time. This leads to death marches.\n\nYour team/company should have some expectations on what quality means and what they expect. Identify risks in the different areas (domain, your solution/product, implementation, etc.) and understand the impact of those risks happening.\n\nGood QA people will help you find or understand risks that you weren't aware of. Deep domain knowledge, context / history, understanding your specific users. They should help make these requirements more widely understood by the development team. It might touch upon security/privacy requirements, performance, accessibility, etc. They are the ambassador for your end-users or stakeholders.\n\nThey might also challenge you in how you'll test or prove confidence in your work. I've always thought the dev team should own the quality of the work, and use leverage that risk-aware mentality of QA to get there.  QA can help drive requirements, but you need to put the work in. You need to know how you'll test your work at a meaningful layer that gives you the confidence to ship it (and negotiate those lines as a team).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, in order to meet that quality bar, you have several tools at your disposal:\n\n\\- static analysis / linting to catch more obvious errors\n\n\\- unit tests to aid design and give developers a fast feedback loop\n\n\\- integration (or wider scoped tests) to ensure the system operates\n\n\\- end to end tests to simulate user behaviour\n\n\\- smoke tests to catch obviously bad deploys (or canary releases, same idea)\n\n\\- manual testing (exploratory)\n\n\\- code review / pair programming\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMany of these things are more technical and are to biased towards catching software defects. Based on the cost/runtime of these things, you may want to run them more or less frequently (on save, on commit, on push, pre-merge, post-merge, pre-release, post-deploy, etc.). Cost decision.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, most of these tools do not address the problem/solution space of what your product actually does.  Good QA people will help find these things and hopefully help you get better at finding these things to strengthen the team and deliverables so you can make better test cases.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you delegate \"QA\" your feedback loop becomes horribly broken. And it turns into \"QC\".",

      "manual testing does not scale. If you want good testing hire software engineers and have them write automated tests(or have your devs write them). A good SDET will prevent more bugs than 50 manual testers. Notice i said prevent, the bugs won't actually be committed given a solid CI system along with those tests. \n\nI started my career as an SDET, we were required to have domain and product knowledge on par with the devs, we did some manual exploratory testing, but the vast majority was writing tests and frameworks for testing an operating system. We had a team in India we contracted out most of the redundant push button/manual testing and the maintenance of existing tests.  I didn't have a very high opinion of their abilities. \n\nThe perpetual problem is that any good SDET doesn't stay an SDET for long, i jumped over to dev after a couple years, the other really good people left for dev roles at other companies. Whats left is generally not the best. This is why most modern companies are doing away with most QA, you just can't get the talent.",
      "First off you have to view QA as a profession. That means that you have to look for professional testers and be very wary of those who want to transition to development or product. They can be good, but they won't approach things the same way as a professional tester. Percy was the kind of guy you all should have made a junior developer or cut loose. People like him don't do well compared to those at your first company because their priorities don't align with the job they were hired for. A professional tester has the vandal mentality, wants to know the product inside out and is willing to grind execution of an edge case in the same way a developer may spend 4-8 hours straight on a bug. Most people don't have that in them. I was a tester for a few years and can tell you at no point did I have the in me. Hell I remember one lady who spent a solid week testing a POS system trying to reproduce a bug that made a volume slider keep moving automatically until the program finally crashed. \n\nI'm not going to say your CTO is wrong but automation is really hard to get correct, especially UI automation. Often you end up testing things that don't provide enough value when weighed against maintenance. I wouldn't call it sunk costs but having a mix of manual and automation testers who work together is IMO the sweet spot. That way the manual work takes priority but you still get automation around critical areas. \n\nFWIW if your automation isn't catching things then your team is automating the wrong stuff. Where I work now we have people whose sole focus is writing automated tests. That's cool and all but they tend to miss a lot because there's too many failures to evaluate or they don't focus on just automating critical paths. They also tend to work independently of the development team and their team's manual tester meaning that often by the time they finish some automation, the feature has changed.",

It's just software engineering with a specific flavor.  \nManual testers are experience experts, and will be a lot better at telling you how the software actually works, and not whether the tests you wrote say it *should* work.  \nThe concept of 'shift left' tries to approach this - using defect prevention (through automation and process efficiency) removes the need for defect *detection* (manual testing), which is more expensive and doesn't increase overall development speeds.

Keep in mind QA is never going to be as desirable as real development. I would say it's expected that a large portion of people in QA are going to see it as a stepping stone, and that's ok.\n\nIf all you can come up with after this experience is \"We need only manual testers, and automated testing has no value\" then you need to take a look at yourself first.",

      "Java has a lot more jobs. Spring is probably the most popular framework in Java land. \n\nIve worked in Java and currently working in Go. I much prefer Go. Its a nicer language to work with and doesnt have as much boilerplate. \n\nGo is easier to pick up also I feel. I joined my job with no experience with it and was picking up tickets after a month of doing an internal bootcamp.\n\nAgain, its up to you. If you want to have a long term career in the current landscape: pick Java. Its a lot more popular. \n\nGo is getting more popular, but its nowhere close to Javas popularity",
      "You can learn both",
      "Personal opinion from someone who's worked in both.\n\nJava gets a bad rap, partially for fair reasons and partially for unfair reasons. Working with legacy Java code is a total slog, it's a boilerplatey mess full of terrible abstraction and forced OOP. However in recent years with the addition of records, sealed interfaces, pattern matching and a few other niceties borrowed from functional languages it's gotten a lot better, and it seems to be improving at a much faster pace than it used to. I actually don't mind writing modern Java 21+. It's certainly not my favorite but it's not bad. It's also absolutely everywhere in backend development, I don't think I've ever interviewed for or worked at a company that didn't use either Java or C# (basically Java but better) in some capacity.\n\nGolang is the opposite. It has a great reputation, which astounds me because it's one of the most poorly designed languages I've ever used. It seemingly learned nothing from the past 40 years of software development.  Error handling alone leads to way more boilerplate and clutter than any Java code I've ever written. The type system is pathetically weak, even C has better enum support. Whoever thought nil pointers and default zero values were a good idea for a language made in the 21st century should be banned from designing programming languages from now on, that's been an endless source of stupid bugs that could've easily been caught ahead of time. However, Go is still huge in the infrastructure space, kubernetes, docker, etc. so if you're looking to get into that I would still begrudgingly recommend picking it up.",
      "You could find startups or niche domains who started using Go who maybe pay a little bit more just because they look for someone with experience in that language. But java&spring is so widely spread that if you want to learn it for the sake of transition and working with it, you will always find a job (eventually with little less pay than go though)",
      "All I see in my area is Java and C# for enterprise jobs, predominantly the latter.  If they ask for something extra it is Python.  Java is always tied to Spring, and C# to Azure.",
      "Don't get hung up on the programming language",
      "Golang is the worst programming language to ever reach mainstream adoption.",
      "We use both at work.\n\nI see more java jobs, usually web applications. Go can also do web apps, but seems more popular for systems (ex: Kubernetes operators).",
      "If you learn Java, you should be able to learn Go easily",
      "Go is not scripting. It's a fully compiled language and it can be used in at least as many domains as Java.\n\n\nMaybe he means Go is *procedural*, which is true but that's considered a good thing nowadays.",
      "Enterprise back-ends are split between Spring and .NET. Yes, Go is getting more popular but if all you care about is getting a job, then Spring or .NET. Spring is vast and will take time to learn.",
      "Java has more jobs. In some geographic areas there are no go jobs at all. Search for the number of jobs in each, if Go does not have half the jobs of Java, then consider learning Java.",
      "I would say in 5-10 years, unless something drastic happens, golang will probably be more popular and Java will phase out. With that being said though, one of the biggest benefits of golang is virtual threads(goroutines) and Java 23 added virtual thread support, so that closes the gap a bit.\n\nGo is just insanely easy to pick up, core packages are managed by Google, it has a massive hobbyist community behind it, and its very good in a serverless environment. My only real gripe with go is unit testing, since you have to design everything to be mockable. Theres no way to just say hey I want this function to return 23 when its called, you have to do a bunch of wonky interface stuff.\n\nI would still learn Java right now though, theres just so many jobs for it."

    "content": "I've been an IT professional for 7 years, I owned a retail shop for the first 5 years, until my partner changed career paths. We provided both retail PC repair/tune-up work, and business IT services. We closed the shop when he left and I started a new business on my own, working from home. I took over our existing IT contracts (which I had mostly served on my own), and still provide in-home support for some of our \"legacy\" customers.\n\nI really enjoy what I do, but the ratio of time spent doing marketing and accounting compared to actual IT work is way too high. I also have a lot of free time that's not exactly mine, that is, I need to be around. If I want to take a few days off, I have to warn a dozen different people, and they may have nobody else to call if something happens while I'm gone.\n\nThe problem is that I really don't know what type of jobs I should be applying for, or what sort of pay to ask for. I have experience with supporting small businesses, from 1-30 employees. I handle everything from planning new office buildouts; terminating voice and data cabling; setting up routers/switches/wifi; spec'ing and building servers and workstations; setting up and administering AD, Exchange, Office365, QuickBooks, etc; and providing desk-side assistance with hardware, applications, you name it.\n\nFrom what I've read, I'd be miserable stuck in a \"helpdesk\" role, as working directly with users is the most frustrating thing I do, but I'm fine if it's a small part of the job. I'm good at explaining things, and acting like I don't want to punch people.\n\nMost of the jobs that look like a good fit for me are \"system administrator\" or \"network systems specialist\", though there are usually one or two specific things I have little or no experience with, such as BizTalk and WebSphere. I'm good at picking things up quickly so I'm not worried about it in terms of doing the actual job, but I'm worried that a recruiter is going to be put off by that. I've always been highly adaptable.\n\nThe one nearby listing that actually offers up a salary range is $5000-$7000/mo. This is for a government (city hall) job. I could live with anywhere in there honestly, but I'd prefer more. Is this a reasonable range to apply to the private sector (assuming comparable benefits package)?\n\nAlso - would most recruiters value my experience similar to someone who's been in an IT department for the same kind of time? More/less?",

But to be honest you will probably hate it after a while.  Usually (not always)  management sucks in these companies, they are all about billing and you won't have a lot of downtime to catchup on learning new tech.  \n\nMy suggestion, get on LinkedIn.  I know a lot of people hate it but it is marketing and you are used to that.  Join a number of tech groups there.  Connect with all your customers and their subordinates.  You might think why?  How are they going to help me? It is not necessarily them who will help you but the people they know.  Connect with recruiters,  I have never had a problem working with a head hunter who speaks English.  They don't cost you anything and your willingness to work with them puts you ahead of the curve.  \n\nBased of the way you write I am guessing you are in the northeast?  New England area?

My responsibilities include triaging bugs and troubleshooting ITSM software and web applications. Additionally, I resolve bugs and issues, which often involves making small changes to SQL queries or JavaScript in ETL processes. I also query data from databases to analyze workflows and troubleshoot processes. I collaborate with CMDB, Solution Architects, and Developers to devise solutions. While I have some exposure to GCP, GKE, and Linux, my primary tasks involve retrieving logs, restarting pods, and updating secrets.\n\nI secured this job last year, and although it's a contract position, they renewed my contract at the end of last year. About 70% of my team members are also on contracts. I find the work enjoyable, appreciate the company culture, the people, and the learning opportunities. Moreover, since the business is involved with the government, it seems stable. Our business unit didn't experience any layoffs during the recent downturn in the IT industry.\n\nNow, I have a couple of questions:\n\n1. I perceive it's quite challenging to transition into the software or web development engineering fields these days. Therefore, I'm considering a role in cloud engineering, DevOps, or SRE. Outside of work, I'm studying courses related to cloud and SRE. I understand these roles typically require mid to senior-level experience, but they align with my interests. Can anyone advise on how to transition from a support role and maximize my salary?\n2. Recently, I received an offer for a similar role/job title from a digital advertising platform SaaS company with over 1000 employees, operating for 10 years. The offer is tempting with a higher salary and additional perks. However, the role is more limited to application support without involvement in Linux and cloud technologies. I would leverage my SQL and JavaScript skills to troubleshoot issues. Should I accept this offer? While the salary increase is significant, I'm concerned about the stability of the advertising industry, which typically suffers during economic recessions. They assured me that they haven't had any layoffs since their establishment and are profitable.\n\nI've been feeling uncertain about my career path and future lately. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

For that, each computer has a local admin account with a unique password based off the computer's service tag.\n\nIt sounds like a pain in the ass, and I thought it was when I first started, but it took me all of a few days to get used to it and those other departments were down for a week while we looked like rock stars (or as close to rock stars as a bunch of snarky tech guys can look).\n\nEDIT: Happy Cake Day!",

No problem on the servers where we have full access to EVERYTHING, but God forbid we can add software to a users machine.\n\nIt's great having one admin account to work on other users machines - if you forget the password, you just have to ask.\n\nThe downside - no accountability.  If you have 4 people using the same account, and one of you screws the pooch, there's no way to lay blame, and you can all deny doing it.  This is why that one account was taken away from us.

Depending on how big this company really is and how much disfunction there is and how much control you will really have in this potential role it could be a really good opportunity.",
      "What kind of budget are they giving you off the rip? If they are committed to giving you the budget to hire and purchase software go for it. PDQ can fix a lot of the patching/standardized software issues cheaply. Managing a shitty MSP can be a full time job though in itself. How long is the contract in place for with them?",
      "3 months into a similar position, but a much smaller company. Pace was super fast at first (on par with my MSP experience), and now is super slow now that I've fixed a lot of the common issues. I've since filled the time with research and operational tasks. Coming from an MSP background, my inclination was to work with the existing MSP as best as possible and preserve those relationships rather than the hostile approach I've seen internal Sysadmins take. \n\nThe stuff MSP sucks at (That you can do better), take off their plate and deliver this yourself. It can be difficult to make your work as an IT personnel \"visible\" to your laymen boss and peers, so use every opportunity like this that you can in order to build confidence and trust. The MSP is probably doing something right if they've maintained this relationship for so long. Allow them to continue to do those things right, but evaluate them and then deliver those evaluations to whom it most concerns.\n\nSomething else: The company brought me on as an IT Manager / Network Admin, but it's actually a wear as many hats as you want situation. That is to say, if you see an opportunity to generate value then do the footwork to see if it's feasible and makes sense ESPECIALLY if it's not a technical fix.\n\nI've calculated that the value I've generated here is about %50 Technical and %50 Process oriented, so be on the lookout for things you think can be improved.\n\nObviously I'm very new to this situation myself, but I hope this gives you some insight. Would love to hear the approach you plan to build out your department. I have Chief aspirations myself and have given myself a 10 year timeline. (7 years would be dope too though)",
      "So some things I would suggest before taking on this kind of role\n\n* Do you have management experience, if not will some one in upper management be there to mentor you?\n* Do you have sales/purchasing experience, have you ever negotiated large contracts with vendors or on behalf of vendors?\n* What kind of authority will you be given to run your department, will you be able to propose a budget and be given a free hand, or will you have to justify every expense, Do you know how to do a budget? do you know how to manage operation expenses or Capital expenses?\n* How does the company's upper management culture see IT, Is it purely a cost center, a profit center, a risk management and productivity engine, or something else?  How the business see's IT will determine how the department is treated.\n* How does the business's future strategy include tech and IT?\n* How will IT resources justify themselves, how will IT projects be measured for success or failure, how will IT priorities be weighted against business priorities.\n* Do you fall under a CTO, a COO, or a CFO.  If you fall under a CFO you are probably considered an expense by the business, if you fall under a COO you are probably considered critical to the operations of the business, if you fall under a CTO then the business is starting to consider tech as part of their business strategy.\n\nFinally, keep in mind a director is a management role, its going to have very little overlap with your sysadmin role - you will need the tech experience to help develop strategy and policy, but you will NOT be implementing your policy, instead you will be hiring the right sysadmins or MSP's to help enact that policy.  I've seen some Sysadmin roles where you had to negotiate software or partner contracts, but that will be a much bigger part of your role.  You might still be the key player in planning a major system upgrade, but especially as you learn to trust the people under you as Subject matter Experts, you should be less and less involved in the details, so you can focus on solving the next hair on fire problem for the business.  \n\nSome people really don't like that kind of mindset, and don't enjoy the accounting, the reports or the people management, and want to focus on the details of the big cool projects - but that way often leads towards micromanagement and a bad department so if you think this is you - its probably best to stay out of a manager role and instead ask for more responsibility as a System Architect or some elevated sysadmin role allowing you to advise the manager they eventually hire.",
      "Despite what some people are saying, where I work, we combined IT, HR, and Comms into a powerhouse department known as Organizational Effectiveness. It actually works really well. My (I'm equivalent CISO) Director of IT (CIO) reports to the Head of OE. Every other dept needs IT, HR, and Comms. Group them together, shit gets done. We actually managed to reach that nirvana of IT being a business enabler and transformation engine and not a cost center in the basement.",
      "Being under HR is a potential disaster as they know nothing about IT.  You will need to communicate up and down effectively.   Lastly you are the only one call person for the foreseeable future.   I bet you spend at least 50 pct of your time as a sysadmin.   Are any new positions in it budgeted and approved already?

      "Honestly, I think there's some value in going to a company that's a bit of a hot mess:\n\n* You're more likely to be able to get a foothold there.  I doubt really well run Fortune 500 companies are banging your door down to be their head of IT.\n* There are tons of opportunities for easy wins.  You could greatly improve their IT landscape by just doing some common sense things, like making sure updates are happening, backups are happening, AV software is installed, etc.\n* Cleaning up a mess can actually be really good experience on how to get things done.  All companies have a bit of chaos, and being good at wrangling chaos is essential to getting things done.  Being an expert at succeeding within chaos is a great skill wherever you go.\n* It's more likely to be tolerant of failure if you don't get everything right the first time.  It's not like they were better off before.",
      "What are they citing as the motivation to move IT inhouse? If they are looking to save on costs, hard no. If they are looking to improve experience, then maybe, depending on how large a budget they are giving you.",

I've seen companies like this, where they started super small and then started relatively fast growth, but didn't grow their support services correctly. If upper management has acknowledged this, then I feel it would be a good experience. A lot of work for sure, but probably worth it.",

    "content": "Hi guys,\n\nNeed some serious advice. I started working in IT a year ago, and really love my current IT specialist job. I am being given an opportunity to transition into IT management. \n\nHowever, I am worried it will affect my career prospect. My current job is cozy and the technical skills required is very low. Everyone around me, including my previous manager have asked me to consider it, and I do feel pressured. \n\nIf you guys can share some stories about your experience, it would help me a lot. I'm especially worried because I am also a young female tech. I am a very big people person and I do my current job very well, so everyone thinks I can be in management, but I keep feeling that there's more than just being a people person, how can I be managing if I don't know much after the basic IT infrastructure or the likes? Please advise, thank you! Ask me any questions regarding this, I might be feeling a little imposter syndrome as well, and I'm also trying to figure out if it's worth it to take this opportunity and continue to be in management, or stay as a tech because I'm more passionate in that.",
    "comments": [
      "Context: Im a director. I used to be the guy that everyone came to for answers on tech problems. I did helpdesk, sysadmin, server admin, network admin, and cybersecurity roles before pivoting into leadership. \n\nI am no longer the guy that people come to for tech answers, Im the person they come to when a decision needs to be made or something needs to be resolved. Instead of doing tickets and solving technical puzzles all day, I do (admittedly a small amount) of paperwork, and spend the rest of my days either doing project management, or keeping up with my team and their work. I listen to them, and seek opportunities to set them up for success, both at work and in their careers. I spend a lot of time listening to my team and giving recommendations on my experience, and if they bring up something I dont know about I take a note of it and make sure I learn about it before I leave the office that day. \n\nOverall, my job is investing in my team, setting them up for success both at our organization and for their next role wherever and whatever that may be. Beyond that, is the part that I believe anyone can do: its just project management, vendor management, paperwork, planning, etc., all the stuff someone with a little bit of drive and organization skills can handle. The most difficult part of the whole job is actually investing on a full-send level into your team. If youre a people person, that might be beneficial to you for sure. \n\nPivoting into management after 1 year could be good for you if you werent sure where youd want to specialize because you can just slowly work on building a base understanding about the things your team will be working on because as an IT manager it isnt your job to be doing the work, its your job to be informed enough to be able to make decisions when the time comes, which is very different. \n\nIf you had hopes on developing a more technical career first before transitioning into leadership, I highly recommend that. Unless this management role comes with a really good bump in pay, and its something you really want to do and the description of what my day looks like sounds like how you wouldnt mind spending your day, I would advise you politely decline the opportunity and ensure them that you may be interested down the line but you prefer to get more technical experience first. Nothing wrong with that. As you said, youre young, so you have time on your side.",
      ">I started working in IT a year ago, and really love my current IT specialist job. I am being given an opportunity to transition into IT management.\n\nDo you have a background in leadership and what's you experience level in general? \n\n  \nNot trying to be an asshole,  but if you are young in you career have no leadership background and only been in IT for a year I would seriously be concerned if they are recruiting you because they see the potential and want to mentor you ....or if they have a DEI leadership quota they need to hit for executive payout or ESG goals. \n\n  \nIn general, I would say that a year in IT without any leadership background, is way too green to be an IT manager.  You've barely learned the foundational ropes, built relationships / etc.  It honestly sounds like being setup for failure.",
      "Two caveats:  \n  \nYou're going to get some harsh critics taking a management role with so little experience, particularly (and unfortunately) as a female. You're going to have to deal with or ignore some sexist rumor-mill stuff, especially if you are being promoted while highly technical and more experienced people are not (even if that's because they entirely lack soft skills). You love your job now - will these social issues make you hate it?\n\nThis will set a trajectory for you. You're already not highly technical, and taking a management role will hinder your ability to grow technically. Evaluate your career goals - your future growth will be limited if you are a non-technical technical manager. If you're content with your role, and feel good about opportunities for less technical managers in your specific subdomain, then this can be fine. Or, if you can leverage your IT experience and work toward product/project management roles, that can be a win. Just be aware that it is tough to grow technically in this situation.",

Its a field with mad scientists, crazies, and passionate, interesting people. It can often be difficult to manage those who surpass your technical capabilities. At the end of the day, they really need a supportive manager that provides them guidance, encouragement, challenges them, and makes them feel safe. Having a good mentor is such an important thing, not only for you, but also those that will report to you. It is something Im so thankful to have, which I will always pay forward. \n\nRegarding imposter syndrome: During my most recent evaluation I confessed this to my manager/mentor. They laughed and told me theyve felt the same way their entire career. Theyve been an executive level manager for almost 20 years.\n\nMy vote is to go for it. Each time Ive been promoted I will tell myself, go all in for a full year. Well, Ive been at the same organization for 15 years. I started as the help desk (as in the only support person), and Ive had 6 title changes, making the same all in for one year commitment to myself each time. Today, Im a senior manager.

      "An IT leadership position should be able to mentor engineers and sysadmins with help on very complex technical scenarios or knowing what resources to give them.\n\nThey would also know how to accurately time the number of hours per project to take to ensure they don't unfairly distribute workloads when not fully understanding the full scope of the workload and objectives it would entail.\n\nAlso, a good IT leader will have phenomenal soft skills, know how to earn respect, and respects others.\n\nIf you're overseeing techs, those techs will not respect you unless you can demonstrate impressive technical ability to them. And that's the sad reality with most sysadmins and techs. Honestly, I don't even think high end tech experience, skills, and ability is necessary for a manager role, but it most definitely will help earn the respect and trust of the people you manage.\n\nMy advise is if what you really want to do in this field is to be a manager or director of IT workers, take the job.\n\nIf your goal is to earn reputation, obtain experience, skills, and abilities to impress yourself and others, go after a sysadmin/sys engineer role.\n\nBoth are good paths, but going the manager route could backfire if it's not what you really want to do.\n\nWith 1 year of just a helpdesk role (aka IT Specialist) you will have a very hard time finding genuine respect and admiration from those you'll be managing. But you could still be a great manager if you listen to your employees in detail and do everything you can to understand their scope of work, workload, and reasonable labor hours it would take to complete a task/project then calculate those labor hours based on what each employee can dedicate to that task per day as well as what is genuinely a priority for the company.\nLast thing to mention, what a sysadmin believes is a priority may not always align what the genuine priority is to the business, so one of your responsibilities will be to ensure the IT team your managing has the same goals and priorities in alignment with what the businesses goals and priorities are.

They currently have no internal IT members. The company has admitted to IT security failures, lacks standardized software, doesn't regularly update computers, etc. They also have what appears to be a subpar MSP that they have been using for almost 10 years. Pretty much sounds like a hot mess. \n\nThat being said, the role offers a significant pay increase (+40-50%), aligns with career goals of transitioning to business/managerial roles vs technical route, and could lead to upper-level management opportunities as they mentioned they could see this turning into a CTO/CIO role down the road. Personal connections that I have within the company provide an advantage at forming relationships. Despite the red flags with the company, the opportunity to build an entire IT department could be valuable for career growth. \n\nWhat do you think: Am I crazy for thinking about taking this on, or should I go for it?\n\nEditing to add the general job description they posted. Also worth mentioning they are sticking IT under HR as apparently they didn't know where else to put it and she drew the short stick about 3 years ago. They have assured me I'd have the power to make decisions without large road blocks or a brick wall being in my way. I haven't asked specifics about budget but will do so at my next (and almost final) round of interviews as it seems that is very important to get an idea of how much they are willing to change.\n- Developing/implementing IT strategy\n- Creating/implementing IT policies and procedures \n- Planning/executing IT projects\n- Evaluate current IT platforms and identify areas of optimization\n- Work closely with existing MSP to understand organization's IT priorities\n- Streamline business processes and enhance system functionality\n- Budget and procurement of IT hardware and software\n- Oversee contract negotiations with IT vendors and service providers",

      "So, I am currently in a Sr. Management position on an MSP side, serving a customer which is very chaotic. Don't make assumptions about if the MSP is subpar or not until you get a chance to truly form some relationships with some of the key stake holders on that side of the fence. It could be that they are stuck with bad partnership from the customer, and they have simply given up on improving it's impossible to navigate the problems on the customer side.\n\nSpeaking for myself.  I've seen this time and time again where new people on the customer side come in and think they know how to solve problems, but don't truly want to take on the challenges that need to be taken in to really solve the problem. Depending on how big this company really is and how much disfunction there is and how much control you will really have in this potential role it could be a really good opportunity.",
      "What kind of budget are they giving you off the rip? If they are committed to giving you the budget to hire and purchase software go for it. PDQ can fix a lot of the patching/standardized software issues cheaply. Managing a shitty MSP can be a full time job though in itself. How long is the contract in place for with them?",
      "3 months into a similar position, but a much smaller company. Pace was super fast at first (on par with my MSP experience), and now is super slow now that I've fixed a lot of the common issues. I've since filled the time with research and operational tasks. Coming from an MSP background, my inclination was to work with the existing MSP as best as possible and preserve those relationships rather than the hostile approach I've seen internal Sysadmins take. \n\nThe stuff MSP sucks at (That you can do better), take off their plate and deliver this yourself. It can be difficult to make your work as an IT personnel \"visible\" to your laymen boss and peers, so use every opportunity like this that you can in order to build confidence and trust. The MSP is probably doing something right if they've maintained this relationship for so long. Allow them to continue to do those things right, but evaluate them and then deliver those evaluations to whom it most concerns.\n\nSomething else: The company brought me on as an IT Manager / Network Admin, but it's actually a wear as many hats as you want situation. That is to say, if you see an opportunity to generate value then do the footwork to see if it's feasible and makes sense ESPECIALLY if it's not a technical fix.\n\nI've calculated that the value I've generated here is about %50 Technical and %50 Process oriented, so be on the lookout for things you think can be improved.\n\nObviously I'm very new to this situation myself, but I hope this gives you some insight. Would love to hear the approach you plan to build out your department. I have Chief aspirations myself and have given myself a 10 year timeline. (7 years would be dope too though)",
      "So some things I would suggest before taking on this kind of role\n\n* Do you have management experience, if not will some one in upper management be there to mentor you?\n* Do you have sales/purchasing experience, have you ever negotiated large contracts with vendors or on behalf of vendors?\n* What kind of authority will you be given to run your department, will you be able to propose a budget and be given a free hand, or will you have to justify every expense, Do you know how to do a budget? do you know how to manage operation expenses or Capital expenses?\n* How does the company's upper management culture see IT, Is it purely a cost center, a profit center, a risk management and productivity engine, or something else?  How the business see's IT will determine how the department is treated.\n* How does the business's future strategy include tech and IT?\n* How will IT resources justify themselves, how will IT projects be measured for success or failure, how will IT priorities be weighted against business priorities.\n* Do you fall under a CTO, a COO, or a CFO.  If you fall under a CFO you are probably considered an expense by the business, if you fall under a COO you are probably considered critical to the operations of the business, if you fall under a CTO then the business is starting to consider tech as part of their business strategy.\n\nFinally, keep in mind a director is a management role, its going to have very little overlap with your sysadmin role - you will need the tech experience to help develop strategy and policy, but you will NOT be implementing your policy, instead you will be hiring the right sysadmins or MSP's to help enact that policy.  I've seen some Sysadmin roles where you had to negotiate software or partner contracts, but that will be a much bigger part of your role.  You might still be the key player in planning a major system upgrade, but especially as you learn to trust the people under you as Subject matter Experts, you should be less and less involved in the details, so you can focus on solving the next hair on fire problem for the business.  \n\nSome people really don't like that kind of mindset, and don't enjoy the accounting, the reports or the people management, and want to focus on the details of the big cool projects - but that way often leads towards micromanagement and a bad department so if you think this is you - its probably best to stay out of a manager role and instead ask for more responsibility as a System Architect or some elevated sysadmin role allowing you to advise the manager they eventually hire.",
      "Despite what some people are saying, where I work, we combined IT, HR, and Comms into a powerhouse department known as Organizational Effectiveness. It actually works really well. My (I'm equivalent CISO) Director of IT (CIO) reports to the Head of OE. Every other dept needs IT, HR, and Comms. Group them together, shit gets done. We actually managed to reach that nirvana of IT being a business enabler and transformation engine and not a cost center in the basement.",
      "Being under HR is a potential disaster as they know nothing about IT.  You will need to communicate up and down effectively.   Lastly you are the only one call person for the foreseeable future.   I bet you spend at least 50 pct of your time as a sysadmin.   Are any new positions in it budgeted and approved already?

      "Honestly, I think there's some value in going to a company that's a bit of a hot mess:\n\n* You're more likely to be able to get a foothold there.  I doubt really well run Fortune 500 companies are banging your door down to be their head of IT.\n* There are tons of opportunities for easy wins.  You could greatly improve their IT landscape by just doing some common sense things, like making sure updates are happening, backups are happening, AV software is installed, etc.\n* Cleaning up a mess can actually be really good experience on how to get things done.  All companies have a bit of chaos, and being good at wrangling chaos is essential to getting things done.  Being an expert at succeeding within chaos is a great skill wherever you go.\n* It's more likely to be tolerant of failure if you don't get everything right the first time.  It's not like they were better off before.",

    "content": "Hi everyone.\n\nI am a relatively new IT manager - actually hit my 1 year today! \n\nI'm an IT hobbyist and passionate about technology. My interest in the field is primarily helping end users and making decisions that I feel best increase security and productivity. In simple words, I make common sense decisions for a staff that isn't really technologically sound. In this position I've led and supervised a staff for the first time. I love it and enjoy bringing everyone up to the same level of proficiency. I've also got to utilize firewalls, network/VLAN, and budgets frequently. My past was tier 3 IT support for a couple of years. \n\nDue to events in both my personal life and work place, I am looking for new employment. I always thought I'd be an IT manager for a number of years before moving up to Senior or Director. It's clear that's not going to happen at my company. I feel that I haven't been in this position long enough for a new company to put their full trust in me (though I've been applying!) - so I was curious how you all felt about taking a lateral step, or perhaps a step back into a role that by chance pays MORE with a hybrid/WFH benefit.\n\nI've been on this sub for a year now and whenever those \"What do you make?\" questions pop up, it's apparent that I am underpaid at my position, approx. $88k/yr. And job searching in my area has revealed to me that I could make more as an IT Analyst, LAN Administrator, etc than I currently do as a manager. I am also concerned that by relinquishing my title, should I move up in the future, my manager experience on a resume might not carry as much weight.\n\nI am curious if anyone had made a similar transition. Thanks! ",

      "First, decide if not being technical anymore is what you really want to do. If you move to any company of size as a real director (and above), you'll be dealing with people, politics and numbers. You will likely not be hands on anymore. Jumping to a technical job just for the pay will not be a wise move IMO. Yes it's leaving money on the table but you need to look at long term goals. Assuming you are OK with not being technical, look for another management job that's a step up. (eg: more direct reports and users, some complexity, etc) I think you'll need some more time as a manager before trying to climb but you could get lucky. I also recommend you get management training. I really like [https://www.manager-tools.com](https://www.manager-tools.com)\n\nGood luck.",
      "Congrats on your first year! To address your question: there's nothing wrong with pursuing a new position that fulfills you/serves you more! Having a year of being a manager on your resume is something that potential employers will look favorably upon, so don't fret, be confident in your applications and interviews. I have heard that jumping every 2-3 years is the sweet spot, but that doesn't mean you won't be considered at other companies. It sounds like you truly enjoy leading by example and helping your org succeed. I would harp on that in your interviews.\n\nIf you want to keep moving up in the field, I would definitely recommend a lateral move instead of a step back/down. Unless that \"step down\" is at a Fortune 500 company or a company larger than your current one where you'll likely be responsible for more than you would be as a manager at a smaller company. I'm just curious, what makes it clear that you're not going to move up at your company?\n\nI made a semi-similar move 4.5 years ago when I was at an MSP. I was solid at the job, but it was clear that there was no room for growth since the company wasn't growing in a way that required a role that existed above mine. It was basically us grunts in the SOC/NOC and then the owners. So I went to work at one of my clients as their IT Manager when the role became available.\n\n  \nMaybe these specifics about my position/comp will help you in your job search. 9 years experience in IT, 4.5 years as a manager. Company of 75 users, and 1 direct report. I'm effectively their IT director since I set the strategy for cybersecurity, technology investments, implementation, networking, etc. and also report directly to #2 in the company. I also oversee IT support and jump into the helpdesk when needed. Lots of hats. I have my CISSP cert along with Network+. I get paid $110,000/yr, 95% remote other than the 5-8 times a year I'm traveling to one of our offices.\n\n  \nCould I make more money somewhere else? I'm sure I could, but I feel valued and feel that I'll continue to grow where I'm at. I'm confident about the growth, but if that outlook changes, I'll certainly be looking for something else like you are\n\n  \nTreat yourself like a business, and make the best business decision for yourself. It sounds like you genuinely care and are giving good work to the place you're at. It's time to do what's right for you.",
      "I was promoted to a director at a company that I worked at for 8 years and made 85k \n\nI took a step back into a technical role at a new company for almost double pay. \n\nThought I would be with my old company for the long term - but things happen. Prioritize yourself and family and see what is out there!",
      "I was a IT Director for about 6 years at my previous place and got hit by layoffs. The new job I landed was a step down from a director role and is just a manager role. Pay is less, I made less base pay as a director but got nice bonuses that pushed me to like 140k annual. This manager role I make base pay of 120k with no bonus. \n\nMy new role, the work life balance is 100x better. Also job security is 100x better which was an important factor in my search. I also went from full remote to hybrid. I dont mind being back in an office and my commute isnt bad. But the nice thing is I rarely look at my work phone out of standard 7-4 business hours. \n\nSo it's had its pluses and minuses but overall I'm fairly happy with the \"step back\" in a sense. There are parts of being a director I do miss, and some of the musles I used to flex as a director I dont get to use as much as a manager now.",
      "If this is based purely on compensation, you should know that the average salary for an IT Department manager is $150k according to salary.com last I checked. Of course this depends on a lot of factors like years of experience, education, region. You may want to do additional research in any case. Of course you're not going to make that kind of money with 1 year of experience, senior positions are usually 8-10 years in at minimum. AFAIK, Analysts and Administrators make less.",
      "It's a pretty common path to bounce between manager/team lead a couple times looking for the right fit. I think i was IC -> Team lead in 3 roles before going IC -> Manager -> Director.  \n\nI think you have a reasonable story to explain what you're doing to prospective employers. It's easy to frame your experience as someone with a solid hands on skillset with the drive and interest to move into more leadership.",
      "It's very interesting, as all roles. IT manager is incredibly general, I know IT managers who earn 300k+ and hold responsibility over 10,000+ devices/servers across the country. Where as I for example earn significantly less with a umbrella of about 350.\n\nOne thing to note, is that IT manager isn't always a more senior position than engineer/admin roles. and being an IT manager doesn't guarantee you access to senior engineering roles where the big money is.\n\n1 year is not a long time for companies to be throwing promotions at you either. You need to learn your craft first and demonstrate you are working at a Director level.",
      "It all starts with figuring out what you want for yourself.\n\nI have had some colleagues that now run volcano hiking tours instead of working in IT. They are very happy with that change.\n\nThe salary and the working conditions will change and for some the latter is really important.\n\nSo listen to yourself to see what interests you about your current job. What interests you in general and find out how to combine those to find something you really want to do for a living.\n\nPS: if you know someone that would pay me 6 figures to professionally test beaches all day, let me know."

Previously, I was a Project Manager for 4 years where I felt confident in my role. I took this new role for the challenge and growth opportunities, but Im currently feeling lost and regretting my decision.\n\nEven though I have a background in software engineering, I'm now tasked with responsibilities like creating infrastructure and architecture diagrams (without any architects or infrastructure team in the organization, just devs and QA), and reviewing source code (something I haven't done in years). These technical tasks are new to me, and theyre taking a lot of time to learn and complete, which has left several of my other responsibilities unaddressed. Despite my efforts to solve these technical issues, I havent been able to resolve anything.\n\nIn meetings, both technical and with users, I often feel out of my depth and it's been affecting my confidence. I feel like an idiot because Ive been asked technical questions in meetings that I couldnt answer. My boss has become distant and today didnt speak to me at all, even delegating a meeting With the staff to a developer who reports to me. Ive never faced such professional challenges before  I have 7 years of experience, have never quit from a job, and have never been fired. This situation has been affecting my sleep and overall well-being. (In this short time, Ive gained weight).\n\nI had definitely become accustomed to project management (Im PMP certified) and had forgotten to stay involved in the technical side of things. I started my career as a QA, then moved to a Agile team Lead, and spent the last 4 years as a Project Manager.\n\nIm seriously considering resigning now and returning to PM role where I felt more competent and secure. Has anyone else experienced something similar? Should I quit now?\n\nThanks for any advice or support.\n\nTL;DR: I know I'm partly to blame for accepting this role, as is my boss for offering it, but I never expected to be so heavily involved in technical tasks. I thought it would be more of a management role. These tasks are further complicated by the lack of documentation. Right now, I feel more outside the organization than inside; my mind no longer feels part of this. In conclusion, I only think about resigning. Should I do it now or not?\n",

I felt the need to learn to code to justify myself to my team. \n\nIm 3 and a bit years in and was since promoted to Director and also given a QA and architecture team.  I still dont know too much about the weeds of coding, but, I have to remind myself, thats not my job. \n\nYou say youve been tasked to do code reviews? By who? Is it because thats what your predecessor did, or is it because youre being told by your boss you must do it? \n\nDepending on the org culture, use your PM background as your super power to figure out how to manage the team.  Youre there manager, and good managers need those PM skills because those are often areas Devs and QA are less strong in. \n\nDo you have job families with career progression for your devs? Do you have a lead? Would anyone be able to have stretch goals to level up and help with code reviews or put diagrams together? Would someone be interested in devops and infrastructure? Could you motivate the team to want to do that because the vision and ideas you have? Do you have budget and opportunity to temporary contract for any gaps youre seeing? Is there an offset you can you find to afford that? \n\nIf I was your boss I wouldnt care so much on who does code reviews or drafts the diagrams, as long as the team is performing well and continuing to improve and deliver.

      "There are two kinds of IT managers, in my opinion: Business Managers and Tech Managers. Business Managers are those that came straight out of an MBA or from another department in business and manage IT. They have to rely on those with technical knowledge to make decisions and budgets. Tech Managers are those that spent ten or twenty years in the trenches and building skills, before becoming a manager. I am a Tech Manager. I have done nearly every role in IT and built a strong tech foundation. Most IT Directors and VPs are Business Managers. I find it very frustrating to spend a lot of time convincing Business Managers to go down the right path. For me, becoming a manager is very rewarding and a new challenge to fight for change and resources. I grew tired of living in the tactical and very much enjoy shaping the strategic vision, where you can make change and improve the environment. To each their own.",

Your priorities, goals, etc. are all realigned.",

Pure management for me is hell.\n\nI do work with some amazing managers and this isn't an anti-management post, but if you are not a people person, I suggest you reflect hard on what you want for long term career goals.\n\nAs an introvert, I find myself absolutely drained at the end of a day where I have been more people vs task focused.  \n\nHaving said all of that, having a mentee succeed is a huge rush.

I love the IT side and getting stuck into technical projects. However, being a team lead has given me a taste of management, but I know moving to head of Professional services will be a big step up.\n\nI think I will likely accept, I know how the professional service dept runs to the T. I'm also getting older and keeping up with the pace of technology is in its own right is difficult and the younger guys/gals coming in, are just better, they have the energy and drive to learn as much technical stuff as they can. \n\nAccepting this allows me to worry less about keeping up with the pace of knowing how to configure everything in Azure and M365 etc. But still allows me to still have a good overall understanding at a technical level based on what I've been doing for the last 15 years.

It was a bit of a rollercoaster, e.g. in the beginning I was able to make some pretty dramatic improvements because the shop was poorly run for a long time, and that was fulfilling, but then came a time of small improvements at best combined with having to deal with employee and personality issues, which was not great. I'm fine now though. Like any role it will have pros and cons, and it may change over time.\n\nFinding other jobs will absolutely be harder. Like somebody else pointed out, there is just a lot fewer roles. On the other hand, if you are good at this and communicate that to a prospective employee you might be fine, because there also aren't many highly qualified candidates either. The unfortunate reality is that many tech managers are not good at what they do. It is very hard.\n\nThe question you need to ask yourself is \"why\"? Why are you considering the transition? If it's money, status, or power, then I would be very cautious. Is it because you want to make a difference and help others succeed? Then it might be a good fit.\n\nA couple of things I found difficult to get used to: Don't assume people will just do what you ask them to or translate expectations into the right outcomes easily, that can require a lot of work. And management can be quite lonely... this may depend on your situation, but I have a large team so I have to keep a professional distance, and my peers on the management level are doing very different things and are also quite a bit older than I am, so it is harder to find a group to hang with and vent (at least inside the company).",

    "title": "Seeking Advice for Transitioning from Tech Roles to IT Leadership",
    "content": "Hello Everyone,\n\nI'm currently aiming to transition from a technical role to leading an IT department. My journey started on the service desk, and I worked my way up to lead a small IT support team. This role sparked my interest in business strategy and continuous improvement, but I left that role to enhance my technical skills and currently a Sys/Net Admin. Despite achieving this, I find that I am no longer challenged by purely technical work. Instead, I am drawn to the aspects of leading high-performing teams and spearheading process improvements.\n\nMy goal is to leverage my experience to lead business initiatives and build strong teams. I am updating my resume and cover letter to reflect this shift in focus from technical expertise to management capabilities, though I recognize the competition is formidable.\n\nTo better prepare myself, I have started listening to the \"Manager Tools\" podcast and am considering an MBA, although I typically prioritize practical skills over formal education. From a technical standpoint, I hold a BS in a technical field and certifications including CCNA, MCSA, ITIL, AWS, and CompTIA. Im contemplating the idea of getting a PMP and CISSP certifications as they frequently appear in job descriptions for managerial roles.\n\nI would appreciate any recommendations on training programs, books, or any resources that would aid my transition. Moreover, if you've made a similar move, what steps did you take? What advice would you offer based on your experience?\n\nThank you in advance for your guidance and insights!\n\nEdit: Thank you for such great feedback. I have started the book \"How to win friends and influence people\" and added others to my wish list. I seek mentorship from my favorite leader. I also understand that i will need to shift my paradigm from IC to Leader and learn to step away from technical to be a sucessful and leading a team of engineers. ",

Include that. \n\nMost importantly, dont strive to be a manager. Those people are a nightmare to work for/with. Strive to be a leader and focus on people skills.",

      "I am in the same boat always been an IC and although led many projects and teams and initiatives am finding it hard to make it sound worthwhile to a prospective employer, the other negative is I never pursued a degree, which is a pain right now, and I'll be honest, I am too old to consider the cost vs benefit unless it is a total last resort, I'll be fair looking at the material some of my team are doing I doubt I would be able to complete it anyway!\n\nCurrently I am forging a path as a Sr engineer but really focusing on the admin and people side, which means being stuck in all the meetings amd 1:1s my manager doesn't want to attend lol.\n\nThe hardest thing for a tech person, and I have heard this from a number of mentors I have had, is letting go.\n\nYou are not the \"doer\" anymore, you utilise your teams strengths and trust them as SMEs, you are the one that removes the blocks and issues, and occasionally uses your experience (and hopefully better people skills) to guide them if they are struggling or losing direction, it's quite hard to let go, sometimes impossible for some.\n\nAs a leader, even an IC leader, you should be totally approachable for any issue and also have the ability to \"see around corners\" for any potential bumps along the way and prepare for them.\n\nIn many ways it is unenviable since you still have a direct manager, whom you may not agree with all the time, and sometimes you do have to have the upward direction \"difficult conversation\" with them.\n\nIf your manager is any good, and knows your goals they will be receptive, supportive and sometime appreciate the differences, other times it is just disagree and commit, you can deep dive and compile lessons learned after the immediate  issue/project is sorted (even if you disagree and are overruled if you stated your reasons correctly and politely, a decent manager will return to that and be more likely to listen if there is a next or similar situation, and most importantly your peers/team will give you a lot more respect and support if they know you were in their corner, that is currency you cannot buy anywhere for any price)\n\nThat's 2 cents! good luck",

      "I took a more technical path and focused on small businesses which gave me opportunities to grow and advance.  \n\nLooking back, Id say the best advice is to network.   I found a lot of networking happens at training classes (in person if possible), or conferences (especially if you can get to local ones).   But find local organizations to join or interact with, get an opportunity to speak at one if possible.  Develop some knowledge in a niche (I went cybersecurity) and publish articles, follow authors and speakers and help promote them.  Being in a niche (like, social engineering as a more specific subsection) allows you to keep up with trends and develop a network.\n\nWhen you get in a company you see as an opportunity, be respectful and helpful to everyone - especially those under your level as you move up.  These relationships will accomplish the work that youre no longer going to be doing yourself when you ascend.   If you dont treat them well when youre not above them, you can only expect pushback and trouble when you are.  For me, servant leadership was easy.  If its not for you, make sure youre aware of how youre perceived by the people you rely on.   If you nurture these relationships well, you will be able to delegate accountability in addition to responsibility and sleep better.  \n\nAlso, the real trick to moving up is having someone capable and trustworthy of filling your role so you can focus on your new, more important, role.  Identify and mentee a good worker early on, and theyll push you up in the way you should be pushing your boss up and making their life easier as you rise.",
      "I think you are well on your way and shouldn't have any problems. You seem to know what you want and very focused on that.  I'd say just keep doing what you are doing, and I think it will be a great transition for you!! Best of luck!",

I'm currently exploring career options post-military and IT Management looks like a promising career that fits my background. I'm interested in any advice or opinions you may have about the possibility of me breaking into an IT Manager role, or if you believe that I'm in over my head?\n\nA quick overview of my background: \n\n* B.S. in Information Technology\n* Summer Internship at F500 doing Malware Analysis\n* Summer Internship developing AI / NLP software\n* 6+ years as Naval Officer (Pilot, Project Manager, Operations Manager)\n\nI have a great deal of experience in people management, soft skills/communications credibility, and am actively working on my PMP (Project Management Professional) certification.

Looking to transition into IT Management without real-world IT experience. Is this possible?",
    "comments": [
      "You dont need an MBA I have a 2 year degree in cyber security and some certs and Im a support manager. Get your PMP or CCNA either is fine dont need both. It would benefit you to start in a an analyst role so you can actually see what its like doing the job and what your team would go through and work your way toward a management role you will have greater empathy and ability to understand the pain points for your team. \n\nMy best advice to someone coming out of the military is dont be a hard ass, ass hole, or extremely strict to the point of where you can only see things in black and white. The worst managers Ive worked with as a manager myself seemed to have all come out of some branch of the military and they all have super black and white views of the world and problem solving. Are hard nosed and tend to make employees underneath them miserable while sitting in their ivory tower proclaiming how much everyone below them loves them with delusions of grandeur. Im telling you this bluntly because I can. \n\nBe empathetic and listen to your people. Most civilians do not have military mindsets. The new generation wants to clock and and clock off when the day is over. Appreciate your achievers, but dont expect your entire team to care as much as your top performers do. Help develop them. Dont talk at them listen to them and talk with them. Be willing to admit your wrong. Be willing to admit your management approach is wrong and accept feedback and be willing to be flexible and change for the better. Dont bend over to your managers just because they are the authority. fight for your team when it makes sense. \n\nI really really dislike the its my way or the highway Attitude so many leaders in the civilian world coming from the military have and it tends to create incredibly toxic work cultures. Its not all military leaders that I see this with but it is a vast majority and Im fairly certain the reason is that they try to translate the toxic work culture that theyve been raised in the military into civilian life. If you can overcome all the stuff Ive put above and be a people management and not a dictator youll have a better time managing and your people will listen to you and appreciate you.",
      "You can find a manager job with that background, but you will have a tough time managing a team without having the technical chops. How long ago were those internships?\n\nYour best bet is probably a small business at around 100 employees with only a couple people in IT. I think you will have a rough time in medium sized 1000-5000 people companies because the manager/director is often also the solutions architect.",
      "If you \"retired\" from the military and have that steady retirement check, I would recommend and analyst role like u/sonofalando mentioned. You will learn what it's like as a non-manager. If you truly have leadership skills, you will excel and move up the ladder quickly to increase that paycheck. \n\nIf you didn't \"retire\" and need a really good paycheck to maintain your current lifestyle, look for Project Manager roles with tech. Specifically around cybersecurity due to your internship background.  Cybersecurity is hot and pays well too. As a PM, you can get an idea if you want to go the technical route to become analyst or engineer. Or you can decide if you want to go the leadership route. You could also just stick with being a PM. PMs make really good money too in large enterprises. \n\nKnock that PMP cert out as that plus your education and current experience is the key to opening doors right now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo specifically answer your questions:\n\n*Does my background/CV make sense for an immediate transition to IT Management?* Not really but it's possible. Just depends on what the company is looking for. If they need a leader that isn't that technical, yes. If they need a technical manager, no. \r  \n \r  \n*Would it be beneficial to obtain my CCNA or PMP certifications?*  Yes, Increasing your education is always beneficial. As to how beneficial, it depends on the job you want. \r  \n\r  \n*Do I need to earn an MBA or M.S. in IT to break into this role?* No, you don't need it. If you want to become a senior leader in IT(Director/VP/CIO/CTO), it would be extremely helpful to have a higher level degree. Maybe wait until you get some civilian experience under your belt before you decide to do this. I believe you will have 15 years to use your Post 9/11 GI Bill. You have plenty of time to decide. BTW...That is IMO the best benefit of the military. You get housing allowance, book allowance, and tuition(to a limit) paid for. USE IT! \r  \n\r  \n*Is it a requirement to gain experience as a Help Desk / IT Analyst?* No, but it would be extremely helpful. You would have a better understanding of what your direct reports are dealing with*.* \n\nAlso, u/sonofalando is also right about the \"it's my way or the highway\" attitude. Non-military people don't respond well to this at all. Barking orders will actually have the opposite affect in the civilian world. I'm a veteran and always hated the military approach. I don't ever bark orders, scream, or yell. My teams love me. Every time I've change jobs, I've had team members asking to move to my new company with me. \n\nWhatever you choose, Good luck!",

      "If you decide to pursue additional education, the PMP route is the way to go.  I just finished my MBA (or MS IT)  as a \"nice to have\" but it's absolutely not something required in this field.\n\nWhere you are going to have problems is during the \"show me\" phase of the interview process.  If you are a rotary wing pilot in the Navy, it's going to be tough to translate those skills into IT skills, outside of the generic \"leadership\" bucket.  You will be competing with people who have been doing nothing but IT the entire time you were in the service.\n\nI'm a veteran myself, so I'm just going to be straight with you.  Knowing nothing else about you, if your resume comes across my desk?  I'll probably give you an interview as a courtesy, but my candidate pool would have to be ridiculously weak or you would have to absolutely hit the interview out of the park if you are competing against someone with real world experience with *any* of the technologies my organization uses.  I'm not trying to discourage you *at all*.  But I want you to know what you are up against.\n\nWith that said, there *are* organizations (particularly State/government/government contractors) that need veterans in order to meet certain quotas or to qualify for specific grants.  Also, veteran owned organizations get preferential treatment in a lot of government bid situations for the same reason, many governments have a target of using a certain % of veteran-owned/women-owned/minority-owned businesses.\n\nI saw in an earlier post that you are concerned about helicopter pilot pay in the private sector.  The reality is that the pilot pay may end up being better (after benefits) than the IT path you may need to follow.  You can use salary.com to have a decent sense of how much a [medivac pilot](https://www.salary.com/research/salary/hiring/medevac-pilot-salary) might make versus a [help desk technician](https://www.salary.com/tools/salary-calculator/help-desk-technician) versus a [project manager](https://www.salary.com/tools/salary-calculator/project-manager-entry-it).  This is part of why I recommend the PMP path.  Also, with either PMP or pilot, you have the private sector for sure but you also have a lot of State and government jobs that offer decent pay but amazing benefits and PTO.\n\nEdit to add: I invite you to shoot me a DM if you have any questions or concerns.

      "That likely wouldnt land you in an IT management position, IMO. \n\nThe problem is, from my perspective (IT Director, 25 years in the field), is you have little actual IT experience. The project management and leadership experience is good though. You would more likely slot it in a PM role or something mid level. \n\nThe main problem is just not enough technical experience and knowledge.",
      "If you were going to get any additional education, I'd go with ITIL or some other service management study. Your challenge will be that you've never managed IT services. IT management is really about understanding what services you offer and putting procedures and resources in place to implement and support those services. \n\nThe PMP is good but I'd say if you want to manage projects.",

      "In IT, the manager isnt the expert, theyre the leader who allows the expert IT people do their jobs.\n\nMany/most business people dont have a single clue how IT works, and as a result they have no concept of how long it takes to do something. To them its all magic so they expect everything to be done immediately. You should spend most of your time communicating with your team and actually listening to them when they tell you that a project everyone else thinks is simple and should be quick is actually a year-long project.\n\nThe idea that you can just yell louder to make things happen faster is completely wrong and will have the opposite effect. Knowledge work requires people who have a mind that is at-ease and can focus. If you cant insulate the team from politics, the stress and distractions of that will hamper their ability to work effectively.\n\nMany people will not like the above and will try to circumvent you and get their thing done. Watch out for this and nip it in the bud every time it happens by addressing nicely with your team and the person trying to do the circumvention.\n\nRead The Phoenix Project and The Mythical Man-Month. Learn about ITIL.",
      "Your Navy Officer background will get you more consideration than the average person.\n\nI would think about looking into the more procedural aspects of IT, if you think that is up your alley.  Cybersecurity is mostly checklists and procedures.  As someone familiar with flying and the military, I know you have tons of experience with those!  A Security+ cert, maybe another as well, would probably be enough for me to hire you as a Cybersecurity Manager.\n\nI'm not sure this type of role is even around anymore, but the military used to have SQA (software quality assurance) that was not for testing as QA in software is often thought of, but as QA for the \\*process\\* that was used to produce the software.  That was back in the waterfall days, so I'm not sure what the agile version of that is or if it exists.\n\nThink about what people think about military people and try to lean into it.",

Started as PM and have worked my way up pretty quickly, but am most proud of the respect and relationships Ive built with the engineers Ive had on my teams. I credit a lot of the leadership principles and practical leadership experimentation (what works and what doesnt) from leading soldiers to that.\n\nFeel free to DM me an can chat more. But if youre sharp, empathetic, and can make things happen then youll thrive.",
      "My advice is that you get into a technical analyst role. That will get you use to working with technical and business types. Get your a+ if you dont have it. Watch some videos on YouTube or pluralsight on systems administration, office 365, etc. then look at making the mgmt change. You dont need pmp or MBA. \nKey thing to remember is you have to get people to do what you want by influence. They wont do it just because they are supposed to. \nSoft skills is really critical.",
      "Your biggest issue is going to be people management. You need to show you can do people management in a non-military way. You may already be good at that, but I've seen some ex-military who assume you can just issue orders that no one will question in private sector, which makes them bad managers.",

      "IT management is about people management mostly , both internal to the IT teams and the business.  Having said that, not having experience in how IT works may be challenging as a first step.  There's a big differences between theoretical and applied science here, and your subordinates will resent you for not knowing what they are.   If that doesn't worry you, give it a shot.  Good luck!",
      "Youre in a great spot with your background to go into IT management. You lack some hands on experience, unless you worked on systems in the Air Force that are relevant to the companys you apply at. Maybe check out Lockheed Martin? I would be pretty proud to work at that level of IT management, or even just project management.",
      "One thing you could consider is project management. Even though there's \"management\" in the title they generally aren't going to have direct reports. Being a PM would give you the ability to demonstrate organization and leadership without necessarily needing to trust you with direct reports. In many companies, PMs are one of the first looked to when there's openings in leadership roles."

    "title": "Most effective way to transition to a new employer",
    "content": "I've been an IT Manager for the past 6 years at the same employer. I'm the Infrastructure manager over a team of 7. My boss (IT Director) was planning on leaving in January 2024 and was planning on having a replacement all figured out this August allowing for some overlap to properly hand off workload.\n\nI was being groomed for the position. Recently though he announced that he would be staying on for another 3 years. I'm happy for him, as he was retiring early (were fairly close) but I'm disappointed because this affects my professional growth plans.\n\nI'm 46 and after being in the same position for 6 years I think now is a good time to make a move. I'm starting to look at new job opportunities using the typical job boards (Linkedin, etc). I've never worked with a recruiter before, would a recruiter be able to help me find a good employer to work for? I've generally just heard horror.\n\nAs an IT Manager what are methods that worked for you to find potential employers?",
    "comments": [
      "Do you have your LinkedIn set to where only recruiters can see youre looking for jobs? Id definitely make sure that setting is on and configured right to your desired locations and titles.\n\nAlso make sure everything on your LinkedIn is cleaned up, nice pic, simple professional headline, jobs and descriptions, certs, degrees.\n\nIf you have both of that you should be getting regular messages from recruiters about positions. Usually theyll come to you, especially if youre at a company is name recognition unless youre just in a niche market",
      "Im not an IT manager, but I think the answer is similar for any industry so heres my two cents.\n\nCommenting on your situation first, it sounds like youre in a perfect spot to look to move on and your motivations for doing so will be v desirable to recruiters/hiring mangers. This will make your life much easier.\n\nAnswering your first question, broadly speaking, yes. Think of a good recruiter like a good estate agent. You can approach them with your situation, they should ask good questions to understand exactly what you want, then their job is to find a perfect match. They can use the connections they have, and their experience in the market, to filter through unsuitable roles on your behalf, which can help your job search feel much smoother.\n\nMost people have negative opinions on recruiters because theyve only worked with bad ones. My advice (and answer to your second question) would be to find a reputable recruiter to work with before you do anything else (updating CV, setting open to work, applying directly etc.). A conversation with a good recruiter will help nail down exactly what youre looking for and give you tons of ammunition for interviews and profile building later down the line.\n\nId suggest an actionable first step of identifying 3 recruiters who would be worth talking to. You can find credible recruiters on LinkedIn. Some filter suggestions might be 4+ years experience, industry specific, location, time at current company, etc. \n\nOnce youve found your 3 on paper, set an hour with each to talk, after which Im confident youll have a strong plan for your next steps. Good luck!",
      "LinkedIn is the current standard. Updating everything and then making yourself available in the settings will open you up to searches by individuals and corporate recruiters. There was a time when headhunters were valuable, but I think they are mostly obsolete. Run your own searches and apply to interesting jobs, but youll most likely be found by other people searching for you. Expect a minimum of three months and maximum of six. If you dont have anything within six months, the economy is terrible or you are doing something wrong with your presentation of yourself. Be picky. Dont select the first role unless it is amazing. With 20 years of IT experience and six years in management, you are valuable. Act like it. Good luck.",
      "The people management doesn't change. But the budget and state of the infrastructure can be a shock to your sense of what is acceptable. It never ceases to amaze me with what some IT professionals choose to ignore unless they are forced to address. As the IT Director, it's your job to make sure the technical infrastructure is secure and also appropriately supports the organization now and for future growth. \n\nIf you're serious, and this is you following the desires of your heart, then move forward as long as the family (wife) understands your motivation. Share the journey with your wife. She will help you to identify blindspots that you've never thought of.\n\nGet your money and get the title. Be ready to grow. It's painful but also very rewarding. \n\nBest of luck!",
      "Recruiters are often pretty useless, but if you somehow find a good one, they really can help find good positions, and also help coach you through the whole process.\n\nI don't really know how to find a good recruiter.  If you have a good LinkedIn page and set it to indicate that you're looking for work, a bunch of recruiters will contact you.\n\nI recommend talking to any recruiter that reaches out, and seeing how it goes.  If they seem awful and unhelpful, stop talking to them.  If they seem helpful, keep talking to them.",
      "Once your next opportunity presents itself, A book that has helped me out grasping a new environment, especially from the people/corporate side of things is 'The First 90 Days' by Michael Watkins. I was promoted into an IT Manager position at my last gig, I've recently transition into my 1st 'hired as' an IT Manager role. Book helped me a ton. Best of luck!",
      "When I was at the management level I found everything through work-friends (co-workers and people I respected).  Make sure your resume speaks to management value added (e.g., people and projects managed, budgets juggled, migrations, and SLAs).\n\nPerhaps take a class at a local college to gain access to their placement services.\n\nTake your boss out for drinks, cake, soda, tea, something to get off the reservation and ask about what he would do in your situation?  Explain how you are happy to keep him around, but concerned about your career and all.",
      "Definitely recommend LinkedIn.  It's how I got my last 2 jobs.  Both were pleasant experiences, direct hire positions.  What I loved about working with the recruiters was that I usually got feedback pretty quickly, so there wasn't a whole lot to worry about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the end of the day, getting you connected to a job is how they make their money, so it's in their best interest to make the process smooth."

I am hoping to get an entry level Network role making \\~65-70k once I finish my CCNA and then start studying Python for Network Automation.\n\n  \nI was just curious as to how getting your CCNA helped your career and what was the salary jump like?",
    "comments": [
      "Doubled my salary in a year with it",
      "It got me laid",
      "Got out of end user support and into a network engineer role because of it.",

      "It helped me earn a higher annual raise and it also earned me more respect from my co-workers. That's about it",
      "I had been working in networking for about 5-6 years and have a degree in Comp Science, so the CCNA was more of a formality for my current role than anything. With that being said, I got a slightly above inflation pay increase which, I mean, was nice? But what I felt it really did was the respect from others. Before hand, I would be sat with colleagues sharing ideas about a problem, Im a confident person and dont have issue in group settings, but I often felt my ideas were put on the maybe list and would sometimes see my idea coming to fruition later, now, for some reason - which I attribute to getting my cert - people are listening to me more and taking what I have to say more seriously. \n\nI could be completely wrong but its just a feeling Ive noticed. I know the CCNA is only a fundamental course but its all I need for my role.",
      "I am in the network department in one of singapore biggest defence company, needless to say, I wasnt part of the network engineer group as im just a assistant engineer.\n\nAfter i passed CCNA, things took a big change, got transferred to network engineer position, gotten some respect from fellow colleagues, upper management noticed and opened some opportunities for me to take a scholarship with the company and asked if i am interested in taking CCNP.",

Moved into Security 132k ending at 135k. Got my CCISP, got 165k base + 20% bonus to the tune of 210k. Then 172k + 20% for 220k. Moved back to Security Architect for 166k  + 7.5% 401k match.",

As you already are able to code that might be something to consider.\n\nYou could also combine the two and look towards becoming a network automation engineer.\n\nA lot of network roles now require some form of automation experience or ability to code as well, so your current skill set will be of good use to you in a networking field.",

In my current job, I handle the APN side for the ISP I work for.\n\nMy department also deals with VPNs and firewall policies, though I havent been directly involved in those areas.\n\nWhat can I do to get companies to consider me?  \nIve even applied for junior positions, but they dont seem interested (possibly because Ive been working with an ISP for 10 years, and that may be seen as a drawback).\n\nIm very motivated to switch to a new field, to the point where Im thinking of tweaking my CV to include experience with routing and switching, based on my practice with GNS3.\n\nThanks",

You do have a step up on other candidates with your background on the company technology.

This cert has helped me with my role soo much. \n\nWithin your ISP find a NOC related role and reach out to the team.

My biggest advice is to find your nearest university and apply to the IT team there. Start at a Tech Support role and grow from there. Do the work, network with the people, and they'll move you up internally. Higher Ed will ask you to do a little bit of everything so you'll learn quickly if you're really motivated.

That requires knowing and understanding the other systems involved. \n\nTry to expand your experience by cross-training or collabing with other groups while you are in the NOC.

I only say this because I see many posts in which it seems the OP is dedicating their time only to obtain one vendors cert then get surprised when it doesn't land them a job right away. In this day and age I don't think this is a great approach as IT services is quite broad, and knowing how to network with different vendors and technologies is critical. Certifications are nice and do have some value, but I personally believe having a broad network skill set is worth more to an employer.\n\nI would make sure to add complimentary skills to your resume, such as setting up networks for virtual environments, connecting various types of host OS's to internal networks, dabbled with other vendor/open source network software, setup Windows NFS/ZFS,  etc......\n\nKinda shows that you're familiar with different types of OS's such as Linux, BSD, Windows, and that you are familiar with creating virtual environments and such.\n\nThen again, that's what worked for me, but I honestly can't say that it will work for everyone.

While I enjoy programming, my true passion lies in the field of Networking. Im fascinated by the intricacies of how networks operate, their role in driving modern technology, and the exciting career opportunities the field offers. With this in mind, Im planning to switch to the Computer Systems program at Durham College, as it offers more specialized courses in Networking and Data Communicationsareas not covered in my current program.\n\nIm seeking advice on how to best prepare for a career in Networking and ensure I meet the industrys expectations. Im currently evaluating several options to determine the most effective path:\n\n1. **Certifications vs. Formal Education**: I plan to pursue key industry certifications like CCNA, CCNP, and eventually CCIE. These certifications seem highly regarded and demonstrate hands-on knowledge in Networking. However, Ive heard mixed opinions on whether certifications alone are enough. Im wondering if employersparticularly in Canadavalue certifications more than a degree or diploma, or if a formal degree is becoming a necessity in the field.\n2. **Switching Programs**: Im seriously considering transitioning to the Computer Systems program at Durham College, as it focuses more heavily on Networking and Data Communications. This would allow me to stay in college while gaining foundational knowledge in Networking and pursuing certifications simultaneously.\n3. **Considering the Degree Route**: If a degree is a significant requirement for entering and advancing in the Networking field, I would also be open to leaving college and pursuing a university degree in Networking, Computer Science, or a related field. While this would be a big decision, Im willing to take this step if it provides a more secure and advantageous position in the industry.\n4. **Roadmap for Success**: For professionals currently working in Networking, Id love to know what the ideal path looks like based on your experience. Do employers focus more on certifications, degrees, or practical hands-on experience? How important are internships or co-op opportunities in securing that first Networking job?\n\nIm trying to ensure I make the right decisions now to build a strong and competitive career in Networking.

    "title": "From Software to Networking (currently have an entry level tech job)",
    "content": "Hello fellow techies,\n\n   I would like some two cents on my quasi-unique situation. Initially, I started with JavaScript, React, SQL, Python, and I messed about with Linux to boot. Basically, I've had a couple of contractual gigs working with CRM & SEO. The two jobs were short-lived (seven and a half months total) but they are tech-adjacent roles that I believe helped me tremendously. Anyway, after many failed attempts at getting a developer role, I got a Software tester position, QA. The role is comparable to what an entry level help desk associate would make: $22. The role is a steppingstone, but I am not that sure that I can see the next level anytime to soon. The lion's share of developer roles at my company are all outsourced to countries that most have never even heard of. Of course, I know that one should test the market and see what is out there, but it does leave a sour taste in your mouth that there aren't many advancement opportunities within your company.\n\nMoreover, about a month ago I started to look into certifications and the various avenues I can take. After a bit of research, I decided to go for a CCNA. My thing is I don't want to cast a wide net and make more lateral career moves than necessary. With my current job I have had administrative, backend, api testing, and have been a part of many of releases. Pretty neat. My thing is if I get my CCNA, would I be able to transition into something higher than entry level? I hear a lot of people say the CCNA is a door opener but at the same time you have to start at the bottom sometimes. I am totally fine with that but I kind of already am doing that. In a nutshell what would be the fastest avenue (in your opinion) to get out of financial purgatory? Should I stick with software because I am already in it or make an attempt at networking and its neighboring fields? I have taught myself a lot to get to this position which got me out of the service industry, but I would say I am not a passionate techie. I see a field that is scalable and lucrative. Working to live and eventually financial freedom is my overall goal out of this. Lastly, any tips from the vets or people who have been in a similar situation, please, your advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading this long & drawn-out post.",

      "The thing about getting a CCNA is that without real world hands on experience, its all concepts in your head. Theres only so much labbing you can do. If I were in your shoes, Id apply to a small MSP with a decent client base in your area. A small MSP lets you jump around department to department ( service desk, onsite tech, sys engineering, project work, NOC, security etc) and you can wear many hats, as long as you are willing to learn.\n\nIn interviews, ask about the stack they offer clients and if it fits the criteria, jump on it. I started my CCNA journey and I was solely focused on being a network engineer.\n\nWhile i did get the cert which may have opened the door for me, starting at the service desk, I quickly realized i knew a whole lot less than I originally thought. It exposed me to a whole new world of sys administration that I would not have experienced if I just worked at a large company maintaining network equipment."

    "content": "Hello!\n\nI would appreciate your help and clarification on this issue.\n\nI have 42M, and my Computer Engineering degree is on hold due to time availability issues in the last year with 4 missing subjects and a course completion project.\n\nI have been employed for 5 years in technical support at a telematics company in Europe, and I have over 20 years of sales experience in IT. I've always been interested in pursuing cybersecurity, but I never thought I could do it because of my incomplete degree and now how old I am.\n\nHere in the job market, at 35 we are considered old.\n\nI see a lot here saying that all you need to do is complete some certifications and you can enter as a junior or even an intern in the field. In my case, at 42 years old, I don't know if this is true.\n\nAnyone at this age level who has managed to make the transition to cyber security, please give me some insight.\n\nThanks to everyone who helps.",

    "content": "Hi, I currently hold several certifications, including CCNA, Security+, Network+, and A+, and I'm aiming to obtain an Azure certification this week. I am also currently employed as a Senior IT Support Technician (Level 3) and am eager to transition to a higher-paying role or more advanced knowledge role specifically network engineer. Despite my rapid advancement from Level 1 to Level 3 at my current company, I have been feeling under-challenged lately. To add Im an 18-year-old junior in university, studying Computer Science, with experience in the tech support field since 2022 in the DFW area so I dont think my experience in IT is hindering me. Despite my qualifications, I have not received responses to the numerous network engineer positions I've applied for. Can someone please provide me any recommendations on suitable job roles or advice, I have a pretty nice resume (according to past recruiters for support roles) I can share with someone to review also.",

      "Wow. Sounds like you are doing awesome for 18 years old. Post an anonymized resume and we will be able to give you better advice.\n\nIm only entry level right now so take my word with a grain of salt but its possible 2 YOE may not be competitive enough for network engineer in this market, but especially with that degree coming you are well on your way.\n\nEdit: also you may want to try r/ITCareerQuestions\ninstead",
      "The truth is you're probably not going to jump directly into an engineer role. \nMost places that are offering the salary for an engineer want a decent amount of experience. \nCertifications are wonderful, but they don't replace experience. \nYou're probably going to need to look more towards network help desk, network administrator, or something more junior to make the leap and work your way to an engineering position. \nThere's no magic to it, but those roles come with a lot of expectation of experience and knowledge that only comes with time and effort.",
      "Since youre in DFW, I would look at American Airlines or Southwest Airlines jobs. Free flights is a huge perk. But yea youre gonna need some serious experience before getting an engineer role so you might just have to be patient a little longer",
      "How long have you been at this job? Like another commenter stated, youre doing wonderful for an 18-year old, so dont feel like youre not going anywhere. It depends on the role but unless its a junior position, companies want someone whos very experienced so they dont have to spend too much time onboarding. If I was hiring manager, Id also have a hard time justifying hiring someones who just became an adult to be a key IT person in the company. \n\nId say look out for junior network engineering positions but also dont be disappointed if responses arent too positive at the moment. It could literally just be an age thing. Youre doing great so just keep it up and work on your professionalism and people skills as that matters WAY MORE than you would think. My certs and work performance got me interviews, but my ability to work with people was the most important aspect of my career.",
      "Honestly mate, youre doing great for your age, take it in while you can, youve started getting experience and you have a good selection of certifications, keep things simple for your life now so you can at least have room to enjoy things while your young.",
      "Man, I am 16 years old trying to get the first cert, and that is ccna how, can we connect on discor or WhatsApp so you can help me."
